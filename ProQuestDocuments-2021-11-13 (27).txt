Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Minnesota Opera announced a 2020-21 season Tuesday that leans toward the tried and trusted.
Mozart and Rossini -- both featured in the current season -- will return along with Paul Moravec's "The Shining," which played to sold-out houses when the opera staged its world premiere in 2016.
But two other works, Jeanine Tesori's new opera "Blue" and Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin," have not been seen at Minnesota Opera before.
Kicking off the season Sept. 26-Oct. 4 is Mozart's "The Abduction From the Seraglio," a revival of a production first seen at Minnesota Opera in 2008. Updated to the 1920s and set in a railcar on the Orient Express, this comedy revolves around a Spanish nobleman who rescues his fiance from a Turkish harem. Irish soprano Claudia Boyle will make her company debut as damsel-in-distress Konstanze.
"Eugene Onegin," a tale of ill-fated love, comes to the Ordway Oct. 31-Nov. 8 in a broadly traditional production first staged by Israeli-born director Tomer Zvulun at Kansas City Lyric Opera three years ago, but with a new cast, including Minnesota tenor David Portillo and soprano Corinne Winters in her company debut.
Minnesota Opera's commitment to contemporary music continues with "Blue," by a composer best known for her work on Broadway and the Tony Award-winning musical "Fun Home." The story of an African-American family riven by the killing of their son in a police incident, "Blue" premiered last summer at the Glimmerglass Festival in New York, where it won praise from the New York Times for Tesori's "strong yet subtle score that avoids the obvious and exudes a personal voice."
Librettist Tazewell Thompson, who directed the original production, will oversee the Ordway's Feb. 13-21 staging, with tenor Aaron Crouch again singing the central role of the Son.
While Rossini's "Cinderella" has been seen at Minnesota Opera before, the March 27-April 11, 2021 staging will be a new one -- the only freshly created in-house production of the season. It will feature Stillwater-bred tenor Jack Swanson, who makes his Minnesota Opera debut in next month's world premiere of Paola Prestini's "Edward Tulane." Swanson will sing Don Ramiro, with Chinese mezzo-soprano Hongni Wu starring as the serving girl who wins her Prince Charming.
Director Eric Simonson returns to summon up the spooky happenings in Stephen King's Overlook Hotel for the May 15-23, 2021 revival of "The Shining," but with two new principal singers: baritone Thomas Glass and soprano Nadine Benjamin.
Conductors have yet to be announced for the season, as the opera continues to operate without a music director following Michael Christie's abrupt departure two years ago. A new position of principal conductor is being created, and finalists for the post will be among those leading the five 2020-21 productions.
Season ticket packages are available now. Individual shows go on sale in July.

Texto completo: Democratic outside groups are ramping up negative advertising against President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, in an effort to weaken him in a key battleground state he won by the slightest of margins in 2016 as their own presidential primary drags on.
On Tuesday, the liberal super PAC American Bridge 21st Century said it had launched a $10 million advertising campaign in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan targeted at working-class voters in rural areas, who were key to Trump’s victory.
And starting next week, another Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action, will begin airing anti-Trump commercials on TV in the Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Altoona-Johnstown, and Scranton-Wilkes-Barre media markets. The group has reserved about $5.9 million worth of airtime through early July, according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics.
The activity on the airwaves comes as the Democratic presidential primary shows signs it may be prolonged. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg is set to make his first appearance at a debate on Wednesday night as he rises in national polls, and in surveys of states that vote in March.
Priorities USA - which has pledged to spend $150 million on the 2020 campaign before the party’s convention in July - has also booked ads in other battleground states like Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the New York Times reported last month. In 2016, Priorities didn’t run its first TV ad until May.
Neither group has booked ads in the expensive Philadelphia market. Bloomberg has bought the most airtime of any candidate or outside group in Pennsylvania, having spent almost $16 million on broadcast, cable, and radio commercials, according to Advertising Analytics. The Trump campaign has spent about $500,000 on the airwaves in the state.
Trump won Pennsylvania by about 0.7% of the vote in 2016, which, along with similarly close victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, helped elevate him to the White House.
The American Bridge commercials feature self-identified Trump voters who say they have soured on the president.
“Now I voted for Donald Trump, but ever since he got in office, he’s been dividing the country,” a National Guard veteran identified only as Steve from Wayne County, says in one Pennsylvania ad. "I don’t think the president understands service. As a former soldier it’s difficult for me to criticize the man at the top, but it’s important that everybody be held to account.
“I’ll vote for more Republicans,” he says in the 30-second spot, “but not Donald Trump.”
Based on information provided by American Bridge, The Inquirer confirmed through Wayne County voting records that he voted in 2016.
American Bridge spent $4 million on a similar ad campaign late last year. One of the ads faced criticism after a TV station in Erie found that a man identified as a regretful Trump voter hadn’t actually voted in 2016.
American Bridge president Bradley Beychok said the group had “undertaken a massive and unprecedented effort to strategically target the voters Donald Trump needs most in battleground states.”
It said surveys showed the earlier ads decreased Trump’s favorable ratings and increased support for Democrats.
“With a wide-open Democratic field and a potentially months-long nominating process, we need to take the fight to Donald Trump right now," Beychok said in a statement. "We will continue to elevate the voices of local voters hurt by the president’s failed policies and broken promises, and up the ante to deny Donald Trump the swing-state margins he needs in 2020.”

Former New Haven Mayor Harp praises Bloomberg criminal justice plan

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — Former Mayor Toni Harp is voicing her support for criminal justice initiatives proposed by Michael Bloomberg, the ex-New York City mayor now running for the Democratic nomination for president.
According to Bloomberg’s campaign, among other proposals, he plans to invest “$22.5 billion to launch a Department of Justice reform hub to evaluate and fund state-level criminal justice reform efforts” and $2.5 billion into the public federal defense system.
Bloomberg also plans to “decriminalize possession and use of marijuana nationwide,” along with commuting existing sentences and expunging records; to increase the standard to justify use of force by federal officers to ensure “deadly force is used only when necessary to prevent serious injury or death” and to seek to influence states to do the same; end federal cash bail; and “establish a National Trauma-Informed Care Task Force to study the effects of early trauma”, and to recommend practices to formalize the “delivery of quality care across federal agencies that touch low-income families and justice-involved people,” according to his campaign.
Bloomberg’s goals, if elected, would include halving the number of people in U.S. prisons by 2030 and cutting youth incarceration in half within four years.
Harp praised Bloomberg for recognizing that the incarceration rate in the United States is too high.
“I think this is a very important plan and it underscores the experience that Mike Bloomberg has in solving major problems regarding our criminal justice system,” Harp said in a statement .
“His foresight and ability to assess what the problem coupled with his experience has helped him tackle this issue as a mayor, and it will help him tackle this problem as president,” Harp said. “We read about these things all the time and we know that it impacts our state, but our incarceration rate in this country is too high, and Mike has recognized that this is a real problem. There is a problem here and Mike has been able to recognize that and he is working to fix that problem.”
Harp previously endorsed Bloomberg’s candidacy. Harp lost the New Haven mayor’s seat in the 2019 election.
“Our criminal justice system is broken and unjust. As president I’ll end the era of mass incarceration, ensure fairness and equality in our criminal justice system, and shift its focus from punishment to rehabilitation,” Bloomberg said in a statement .
“In New York City, our Administration reduced incarceration by nearly forty percent, and as president, I will work to cut incarceration in half by 2030 and cut youth detention in half by the end of my first term,” he said. “We’ll invest in community-led programs to rebuild trust in our justice system, prevent discrimination against Americans who have served time and help them access jobs and opportunity - while ending cash bail, court fees, and other unfair practices that disproportionately impact low-income Americans. The time for comprehensive criminal justice reform is long overdue, and as president, I will get it done.”
In the release, Bloomberg’s campaign noted that, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, the United States incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prison population, even though the country makes up just 5 percent, roughly, of the global population.
The Prison Policy Initiative, a Northampton, Mass.-based institution, reported that African Americans are 13 percent of the U.S. population overall, but, as of the 2010 census, represented 40 percent of those incarcerated.
Bloomberg has been criticized during his campaign for the New York City Police Department’s “stop-and-frisk” program , which he endorsed as mayor, but apologized for in recent months.
According to the New York City government, under the stop-and-frisk policy, officers can temporarily detain, or stop, an individual if they have “a reasonable suspicion that you are committing, have committed, or are about to commit a crime.”
If, during a stop, an officer “reasonably believes you have a weapon, he or she is permitted to pat down (frisk) your outer clothing,” and, if they feel an object they “reasonably believe” to be a weapon, they can “reach inside your clothing and grasp the object to determine whether or not it is.”
The New York Civil Liberties Union, citing annual reports from the NYPD, reported that stops by New York City police officers rose during Bloomberg’s tenure in office from 97,926 in 2002 to a height of 685,724 in 2011, then decreased to 532,911 in 2012 and 191,851 in 2013.
In each of those years, between 82 to 89 percent of those stopped were not given a summons or arrested, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union.
According to the NCLU, “black and Latino males between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 41 percent of stops between 2003 and 2013,” despite making up 4.7 percent of the city’s population. Just under 90 percent were neither arrested nor given a summons, according to the NCLU.
Bloomberg’s campaign has said he realized in May or June of 2012 the program was harming people of color in the city after speaking with “advocates and leaders in the Black community,” according to CNN.
The NYPD issued a memo in May 2012 reminding officers not to racially profile detainees, as Federal Judge Shira A. Scheindlin granted class action status to a suit challenging the policy in court, according to the New York Post.
In August 2013, Scheindlin found that the program violated the constitutional rights of people of color in the city, as officers routinely detained “blacks and Hispanics who would not have been stopped if they were white.”
Bloomberg said at that time that he hoped the appeal process would “allow the current stop-and-frisk practices to continue through the end of his administration,” according to the New York Times, as he “wouldn’t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.”
He apologized for the policy in November, according to the New York Times, saying he did not fully understand the “impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities.”
“Over time, I’ve come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself. I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand that back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren’t good enough,” Bloomberg said during the speech, according to FactCheck.org. “Now, hindsight is 20/20, but as crime continued to come down as we reduced stops, and has continued to come down during the next administration, to his credit, I now see that we could and should have acted sooner, and acted faster to cut the stops. I wish we had. And I’m sorry that we didn’t.”
Harp told the New Haven Independent that stop-and-frisk was a “mistaken policy,” noting that Bloomberg had apologized.
She praised other aspects of Bloomberg’s plans in a Tuesday interview with the Independent, including investing $100 million annually to make the “My Brother’s Keeper Initiative” a federal program focused “on creating opportunity while preventing entry into the criminal justice system,” according to his campaign.
The “My Brother’s Keeper” initiative, founded by former President Barack Obama, works to aid young men of color in achieving five developmental milestones — a healthy early childhood, reading at grade level by the third grade, graduating from high school, post-secondary education and training and entering the workforce — and help keep them safe from violence and its ramifications.
Bloomberg plans to further invest in communities of color though his Greenwood Initiative, which would strive to “deliver economic justice and create generational wealth for Black Americans by addressing systematic bias and making strategic investments in communities and businesses,” including by investing $70 billion in 100 disadvantaged American neighborhoods and promoting homeownership.
Harp also praised the idea of ending cash bail and further investing in the public defender system.
“The whole idea that if you’re poor in America you’re going to have a different interaction with the criminal justice than you would if you were rich” is wrong, Harp said, according to the Independent. “Bloomberg gets it.”

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is hiring hundreds of workers in California to post regularly on their personal social-media accounts in support of the candidate and send text messages to their friends about him.
The effort, which could cost millions of dollars, is launching ahead of California's March 3 primary and could later be deployed nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It is among the most unorthodox moves yet by the heavy-spending billionaire and blurs the line between traditional campaign organizing and the distribution of sponsored content.
Most campaigns encourage supporters to post on social media about their candidates, but paying them at this scale to do so on their personal accounts is unusual, experts say.
A California staffer and the documents reviewed by the Journal describe a multimillion-dollar-a-month effort aimed at helping Mr. Bloomberg attract support after he entered the race months behind his rivals. The documents say the campaign is adopting a strategy, which it says the Trump campaign used effectively, to try to influence potential voters through people they know and trust rather than relying on outreach from strangers.
To staff the effort, the campaign is hiring more than 500 "deputy digital organizers" to work 20 to 30 hours a week and receive $2,500 a month, the documents show. Those workers are expected to promote Mr. Bloomberg weekly to everyone in their phones' contacts by text message and make daily social-media posts supporting him, the documents show.
"The Fight for Equal Rights Has Been One of the Great Fights of Mike's Life," reads one suggested prompt regarding Mr. Bloomberg's early support for same-sex marriage.
President Trump's reelection campaign includes staff dedicated to digital media but doesn't compensate people to post on their personal social media accounts, a campaign spokeswoman said.
Helping organize the effort is Outvote, an app that lets users send pre-written texts, post campaign materials to social media and send data back to campaigns. The app, funded by Higher Ground Labs, a Democratic political technology incubator, generally focuses on pushing volunteers to distribute content. Outvote also allows users to look up whether their friends have voted in past elections by matching their contact lists with public data.
A spokeswoman for the campaign characterized the strategy as the future of political organizing. "We are meeting voters everywhere on any platform that they consume their news," a campaign spokeswoman said. "One of the most effective ways of reaching voters is by activating their friends and network."
While Facebook Inc.'s policies historically have treated political advertising and influencer marketing as separate spheres, the company recently has begun to grapple with the intersection of the two.
It isn't clear whether messages like those the Bloomberg campaign is suggesting would require labeling as sponsored content under Facebook's disclosure rules. A Facebook spokeswoman said posts by "content creators" would need labels if a campaign paid for them, but that posts by campaign staffers wouldn't. The company didn't address how it would categorize posts by employees paid to promote content to their personal networks.
A review by the Journal of social-media posts by some people being paid by the campaign found they aren't labeled as sponsored content.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has said that merely tagging a brand or business on social media is a form of endorsement that falls under its purview—and should be disclosed if an audience would see an endorsement differently knowing that an influencer had benefited financially.
The Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman said posts from its deputy field organizers wouldn't need to be labeled, describing them as a form of political organizing rather than paid influencer content.
Political campaigns have long used a combination of volunteers and paid workers to do things like run phone banks and knock on doors. But experts said the Bloomberg campaign's willingness to pay to leverage supporters' existing social connections is novel.
James Thurber, professor of government at American University, said groups promoting political issues sometimes use similar strategies, but it is unusual from a candidate. "It's classic AstroTurf tactics," he said, referring to political efforts backed by powerful individuals or lobbying groups but designed to appear grass-roots. "When you have unlimited resources the way Bloomberg seems to, you can do that."
At least until recently, the Bloomberg campaign also planned to recruit another 2,500 campaign "digital organizing fellows" who would be paid $500 a month to post daily on social media and put every person in their contact list into the campaign's database, according to documents reviewed by the Journal and a deputy organizer who was told to expect to oversee five such fellows.
The spokeswoman said the campaign had decided not to proceed with the fellows, and had changed the title of the $2,500-a-month deputy digital roles to "deputy field organizer" to reflect that the role might also include more traditional campaign activities.
Bloomberg's spending has helped lift his standing in polls , enabling him to qualify for Wednesday's Democratic debate.
Since declaring his candidacy late last year, Mr. Bloomberg has exceeded the combined advertising spending of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
The Bloomberg campaign also recently worked with an offshoot of media and marketing company Jerry Media to contract with large meme accounts to push the campaign, the New York Times has reported , leading Facebook last week to clarify its rules around such posts.
The Bloomberg campaign will suggest content for sharing and exert some control over the social-media outreach efforts, according to the documents reviewed by the Journal. Though the campaign won't have direct access to or authority over organizers' social-media accounts, a team of quality-control staff will monitor their posts.
"Ha! Even Republicans think Mike is our best bet to defeat Trump! Let's prove them right," said one suggested message for text or social media, linking to a news article citing conservative political operatives bullish about Mr. Bloomberg's chances.
The campaign's approach is fine with at least some unpaid Bloomberg supporters, like Jason Miller.
A Michigan rabbi who runs a social-media marketing company, Mr. Miller said he believes the former New York mayor is "a mensch" and that his willingness to spend heavily makes him uniquely suited to beating Mr. Trump.
Mr. Miller said he supported transparency in paid commercial promotions but sees the ethics around political activism as less clear.
"With a campaign, there is a gray area," he said, noting the standard practice of assigning both volunteers and paid staff to phone bank and knock on doors. While clearer lines might need to be drawn in social media, he said, "it took decades for TV and radio to figure out what disclosure for ads should be."

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinstein's rape trial started deliberating on Tuesday, weighing charges in the landmark #MeToo case that could put the once-powerful Hollywood mogul behind bars for the rest of his life.

The panel of seven men and five women heard instructions in the law from the judge before going behind closed doors to consider charges that Weinstein raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performed oral sex on another woman, TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi, in 2006.

Jurors will also be examining actress Annabella Sciorra's account of a mid-1990s rape in considering charges alleging Weinstein is a sexual predator, even though the allegation is too old to be charged on its own due to the statute of limitations in effect at the time.

About 40 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note asking for the legal definition of terms like consent and forcible compulsion, and sought clarity on why Weinstein wasn't charged with other crimes stemming from Sciorra's allegation.

Prosecutors built their case around graphic, often-harrowing testimony from those women, along with three other accusers who were not part of the criminal case but were allowed to take the witness stand because they say Weinstein used them same tactics on them.

Weinstein's lawyers contend the acts were consensual. They focused on friendly, flirtatious emails some of the women sent to Weinstein and further meetings some of them had with him after the alleged assaults.

A torrent of allegations against Weinstein in October 2017 spawned the #MeToo movement.

His trial is seen as a watershed moment for the cause, but Judge James Burke has cautioned jurors that it is "not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."

Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno sent a similar message in a Newsweek essay over the weekend, drawing complaints from a prosecutor who said she appeared to be trying to influence the jury.

Rotunno wrote that Weinstein's jurors "have an obligation to themselves and their country, to base their verdict solely on the facts, testimony and evidence presented to them in the courtroom," not critical news stories, unflattering courtroom sketches or other outside influences.

Confronted about the essay in court Tuesday, Rotunno said she was writing "about the jury system as a whole" and was not speaking to the jury in Weinstein's case.

Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said Rotunno's essay was "100% inappropriate." She asked Burke to instruct the jury to ignore the piece and revoke Weinstein's bail and send him to jail because, she argued, it couldn't have been done without his permission.

Burke denied the prosecution's request, but told Weinstein: "I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut."

Two weeks ago, Rotunno was criticized in court and on social media for an interview she gave to The New York Times podcast The Daily in which she blamed victims for getting sexual assaulted.

"That was taped a long time ago," Rotunno explained after Illuzzi questioned the timing of the interview, which aired Feb. 7.

The Times said later that the interview was recorded on Jan. 28 -- five days after opening statements and the start of testimony.

In her closing argument Friday, Illuzzi said that Weinstein treated the women who accused him like "complete disposables" and made them feel ashamed even though he was the one who was at fault.

"What he wants to do is he wants to get them in a situation where they feel stupid. If you feel stupid and belittled, belittled, stupid people do not complain," the prosecutor told jurors.

But Rotunno said in her closing argument last week that the prosecutors had "created a universe that strips adult women of common sense, autonomy and responsibility."

Rotunno suggested that, according to prosecutors, Weinstein's accusers "are not even responsible for sitting at their computers sending emails to someone across the country."

Haleyi, a former "Project Runway" production assistant, testified that Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and sexually assaulted her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, "No, please don't do this, I don't want it."

The woman who says Weinstein raped her in 2013 sobbed in court as she described how she sent Weinstein flattering emails and kept seeing him after the alleged rape because "I wanted him to believe I wasn't a threat."

The Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the rape accuser because it isn't clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.

Texto completo: PORT ST. LUCIE – Mickey Wright was the greatest female golfer.
She had the most perfect golf swing.
She was the most important player on the LPGA Tour.
I say all those things without having her seen her play. I say all those things because that's what the game's greatest players said about her, legends such as Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Kathy Whitworth.
Golf and the Treasure Coast lost a big piece of history Monday when Mary Kathryn "Mickey" Wright died at 85 after a heart attack. She passed away in Port St. Lucie, where she had lived since 1974.
Mickey and I had a unique relationship. Not only had I never seen her play, I never met her.
I called her in 2003 when I was the golf writer for the Palm Beach Post and, much to my surprise, she answered the phone. I fully expected the call to go to a recording and I would never hear back.
But there was Mickey's voice. We chatted for a while, about Annika Sorenstam's decision to play against the men in the PGA Tour's Colonial tournament, about the sport and about her life. I was talking to a legend like she was a friend.
Mickey ended the conversation with a warning, however: "Craig, I'll talk to you whenever you call, but if you ever try to come see me, I'll never talk to you again."
OK.
I never did try and find where Wright lived, just off the Saints course in Club Med. I wasn't stupid.
As I looked closer at her career and her life, I understood why she required her privacy. When she joined the LPGA Tour in 1955, it was barely a blip on anyone's radar.
Few fans cared about women's golf in the 1950s. But Mickey changed that. Her swing was so elegant, her game so tight, her mind so focused.
She was the Tiger Woods of the LPGA Tour. Fittingly, both have 82 career titles on their main tour and attended Stanford.
Mickey won 79 of her 82 career LPGA titles during a 12-year span from 1957-68, averaging 10 wins a season from 1960-64. She is the only woman to have held the four major titles at one time.
But the pressures to play and win every week forced Mickey to virtually retire at the age of 34. If Mickey didn't play, nobody cared about the tournament.
Sound familiar?
All Mickey wanted to do was hit a golf ball, not stand in front of a microphone or a camera. When I asked her if she ever thought about playing against the men, like Annika was doing, I already knew the answer.
"Golf is show business today," Mickey said. "If you start with that premise and believe in that, then anything goes. It's hard to know how you feel when you're being promoted by the promoters. I'm not into that."
When Mickey played in her last official tournament in 1994, LPGA players flocked to her gallery when their round was over. It was like an opportunity to see the magical Oz. Mickey's last public appearance was in 1996, almost a quarter century before her death.
I knew how fortunate I was to be able to talk to Mickey on the phone. I didn't call her often, maybe two or three times a year, and would always learn something new about her.
Here's one of her best golf tips: Mickey said Billy Casper, who like her grew up in San Diego, told her to practice putting at dusk, when you have to rely more on your feeling than your eyes.
Port St. Lucie was the perfect town for Mickey to spend the back nine of her life. It was quiet and peaceful, with a golf course out her back door. A ranger at the course once brought her a strip of synthetic turf so Mickey could hit balls without taking more than a few steps.
When my son Eric almost died in 2005 after a bacterial infection, Mickey wrote me a long letter saying how she was praying for Eric. Who writes letters anymore?
Two years later, I received a phone call from Mickey's longtime manager, Peggy Wilson, who gave me some bad news: Mickey had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery.
"Mickey might be mad at me for doing this, but I know she would want you to know," Wilson said.
I broke the story about Mickey's breast cancer, but there was no celebration for this national scoop.
Mickey recovered from the cancer and continued to play the stock market, do the New York Times crossword puzzle and watch golf on TV.
When she was named the 2010 Bob Jones Award winner, the USGA's highest honor, I asked her if she would do an interview on a radio show I co-hosted.
Mickey hesitated but finally said yes, only because she felt it would be good for the USGA. A few years later, I asked her to do another radio show. She said no.
I never asked again.
It's been more than a year since I heard Mickey's voice, and I'm saddened I'll never hear it again.
I don't think it was a coincidence I was covering the PGA Women's Stroke Play Championship in Port St. Lucie on Monday, the day she passed.
She may have been the best female player with the best swing and the pressure of the fledgling tour riding on her. But she was so much more.
She was one of golf's greatest treasures.

Texto completo: Following the suspect's arrest, a police report confirmed what many already suspected: this was a politically motivated attack, perpetrated by a man who confessed a dislike for Trump and wanted to "take a stand" against Republicans.

These are divided times but political violence will never have a place in our democratic society. It runs directly counter to what America stands for -- free speech, freedom of association and the free exchange of ideas without fear of retribution.

We must be unfailingly consistent in protecting the rights of those who take part in the political process, regardless of what hat they wear or who they vote for. Anything less would be an abject failure to uphold the values of our Founding Fathers.

Mayor Lenny Curry said it best following the attack: "Nowhere in our country, nowhere in our city, should anyone fear for their physical health because of their political views and political activities regardless of party."

Unfortunately, if you live outside of the Jacksonville region, there's a good chance you haven't heard much about this highly newsworthy event. National media were slow to cover the attack. This is the latest example of bias from the mainstream media against Trump supporters.

If they did cover it, some mainstream outlets did so with a level of misdirection that borders on malpractice. For example, Politico ran the following headline: "Republicans vow ‘revenge' at ballot box after volunteers nearly hit by van."

Journalists are framing the story in terms of Republicans taking "revenge," making us out to be aggressors mere hours after volunteers were victims of political violence.

Imagine if the sides had been flipped, and a Republican had attempted to run over a group of Democratic Party volunteers. The New York Times and Washington Post would run front-page stories mourning the state of political discourse. Washington journalists would be rushing to Jacksonville, speaking with volunteers targeted, while asking every Republican to disavow the actions.

Sadly, Republicans don't get that kind of treatment.

Republicans in Florida and across the nation will not be silenced or deterred by this cowardly act of violence. We will remain vigilant and continue the important work of re-electing President Trump with even more enthusiasm. We will do so with decency and civility toward those who disagree with us.

Republican, Democrat, independents, it doesn't matter. Everyone deserves to voice their opinion without fear of attack -- and despite what you might hear from the media, that includes supporters of President Trump.

Joe Gruters is chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.

Texto completo: Barton Springs Mill has grown significantly since we first wrote about it in 2017, including a recent move to a new location at 16604 Fitzhugh Road in Dripping Springs on the campus of Treaty Oak Distillery.
But the biggest change for Austin shoppers is that customers at Central Market can now buy the company’s heirloom grains and corn products in the bulk section. Owner James Brown continues to sell heirloom rice and freshly milled flour and cornmeal at local farmers markets, but you can also swing by either the north or south location of Central Market to shop from a dozen selections, including blue corn grits, Einkorn wheat berries, organic cornmeal, grits and polenta, and TAM “00” flour for pasta and pizza, an all-purpose flour that is a mix of Rouge de Bordeaux and Sonora wheat.
You can buy an even wider variety of products directly from the mill, which is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays. Salt & Time, Confituras and Sour Duck also all carry some Barton Springs products. For more info, go to bartonspringsmill.com.
Junior League’s Austin Entertains event returns for the fourth year
The Junior League of Austin has been around for more than 80 years, and although its best-known event, A Christmas Affair, takes place over the holidays, the organization has added an annual food event to the schedule.
Austin Entertains — named after the 2002 community cookbook — is now in its fourth year and will return Feb. 27 at the the Junior League’s Community Impact Center, 5330 Bluffstone Lane, to showcase the breadth of women entrepreneurs in Austin. More than 30 local restaurants and food businesses will be serving small bites and drinks. Tickets cost $85 for general admission and $150 for VIP, and all proceeds go to the Junior League’s community efforts. More info and details at jlaustin.org.
Share your memories of the South Congress and South First H-E-Bs
The days are numbered for two popular H-E-Bs in South Austin.
The San Antonio-based grocery announced last year that the store at South Congress Avenue and Oltorf Street and the store at South First Street and William Cannon Drive would both close this year to make way for new stores that are under construction.
The South Congress and Oltorf store, which opened in 1957, will be replaced by a multistory location on the same southwest corner. However, because construction is expected to take at least two years, the San Antonio-based grocery is opening a temporary store on the northeast corner of the intersection in a former CVS. That store is scheduled to open in coming weeks, and the SoCo store is scheduled to close on March 22.
The South First and William Cannon location, which opened in 1994, will close April 2. A new 130,000-square-foot store at East Slaughter Lane and South Interstate 35 is scheduled to open March 27.
For 15 years, not a week has gone by that I don’t shop at one of these stores, so I’m working on a story about what they’ve meant to South Austinites and how they’ve changed as the community has grown. I’d like to hear your memories of shopping at the store. We’ll be running these stories in mid-March, so email me at abroyles@statesman.com by March 5. If you don’t use email, you can call me at 512-912-2504.
AISD adds grass-fed beef to the menu at Austin schools
When more students eat school lunch, the quality of the lunch improves, at least in districts like Austin Independent School District, which had another turn in the national press last week.
School lunch advocate Jennifer Gaddis wrote an op-ed in The New York Times called “Why Are You Still Packing Lunch for Your Kids?” about some of the same issues I’ve been writing about locally.
The gist: In many areas of the country, school lunch has improved to the point that parents who pack lunches for their kids should at least consider having their students eat the school lunch a few times a week.
Increased participation means bigger buying power to improve the quality of ingredients served, which AISD food services and nutrition director Anneliese Tanner has made a priority since taking over the job five years ago.
Tanner, who was named a Good Food Institutional Hero from the Good Food Purchasing Program last year, has been increasing the quantity of scratch-made meals and local produce used, but this week, the district announced that the more than 100 schools in the district will now be serving grass-fed ground beef.
“Due to an increase in student meal participation, all AISD cafes will now offer local, grass-fed ground beef from Augustus Ranch in Yoakam, Texas,” Tanner said in a news release.
Parents had indicated that this was a priority in the annual AISD Food Service survey, and deliveries of this pasture-raised meat started in January. The district estimates that it will use 73,200 pounds of beef this school year to make meals, including nachos, enchiladas, meatloaf and the ever-popular crispy beef tacos.
AISD was already serving grass-fed burger patties at high schools in the 2018-19 school year and at middle schools this year. Another new addition coming this spring: organic chicken meatballs from the Austin-based Beetnik Foods.
Tanner notes that there are still a few beef products that are not grass-fed: burger patties at elementary schools, and beef fajita and barbacoa, which are offered at high schools.
Now that grass-fed beef is on the menu, what’s next?
In 2018, Tanner calculated that if every student not currently eating lunch ate school it twice a week, AISD could serve entirely organic produce, and if students who aren’t eating school lunch now ate it three times a week, AISD could serve organic milk at every meal.
Also of note: Although many school districts around Texas struggle to keep up with school lunch debt, which has sparked a number of creative — and moving — fundraisers in recent years, AISD launched a crowdsourced fundraiser account in December to help recoup the costs of these courtesy meals.
The fundraiser hit its $10,000 goal within a few weeks, topping off at $11,560. (The fundraiser is still open for the remainder of the semester. Go to give.livingtree.com and search “AISD.“)
“I was once blessed when I needed it most and now I want to pass it on,“ wrote one donor. ”May God bless every single student and family who may benefit from this gift.”

Unfiltered Pop star Billie Eilish is Gen Z's outrageous fashion role model

Texto completo: Mila Docheva faced down the camera, her contours camouflaged by an outsize hoodie raucously inscribed with neon graffiti. Her turnout, which she posted on Instagram, was an homage to her idol, pop star Billie Eilish.
"When I dress like Billie, I feel just a little bit closer to her," Mila, 14, said through a translator, in an email (she lives in Silistra, a town in northeastern Bulgaria). "I'm not a girlie girl. I am curvy, and I ride a skateboard. Feeling comfortable in my skin is important to me. Billie's style gives me the courage to do that."
Swarms of girls and young women ranging in age from under 10 to their early 20s are echoing those sentiments. They are smitten with Eilish, who took home an armful of Grammys recently, remodeling themselves in her image, posting gaudy makeovers on Instagram and other social platforms, from places as far-flung as Tbilisi and Nashville.
Eilish's following has swelled since her first single, "Ocean Eyes," went viral on SoundCloud five years ago. Her style clout has grown alongside it, on infectious display on Instagram, where she has millions of followers. It recalls the kind of fashion fervor rarely seen since Madonna's early videos incited throngs of very young fans to shimmy their frames into merry widows and pile on stacks of bangles and cataracts of chains.
The enthusiasm of Eilish's devotees denotes a striking turnabout, a new generation's rejection of the flirty babe aesthetic embodied by contemporary idols like Ariana Grande in favor of something more crazily improvised and less strenuously sexual.
At 18, Eilish, who often goes without makeup, favors a pastiche of outsize 1980s and '90s hip-hop and skater looks. That look speaks assertively to a Gen Z crowd chary of artifice and aggressive displays of sensuality.
"Her look is not about vanity," said Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster and brand strategist. "She is flipping the idea of beauty to something surreal, something influenced by gaming and the cyberculture."
"These are not the filtered images of millennials," Greene said.
Since arriving on the pop scene, Eilish has underplayed, and even willfully sabotaged, the vampiness that has long been deemed a prerequisite to stardom. To some she is the anti-Ariana, a tomboyish naïf.
Her look, paradoxically standoffish and in your face, is punctuated by shocks of blue or green hair, riotously patterned tops and tracksuits, and thorny punk and goth references. It is, in Mila's phrase, "an act of rebellion," as provocative as it is protective.
"She has an armor that's bright and loud," said Rachel Gilman, a fashion stylist whose clients have included Bloomingdale's and Adidas. "It's dye your roots green and wear the baggiest clothes in the room. It's good for girls to see that they can succeed without wearing a push-up bra if that isn't their vibe."
The star's advent, some say, could not have been more timely. "It feels fair to describe Eilish's aesthetic as both an antidote to and a queering of the hyper-feminized pop-star archetype," Amanda Petrusich wrote in The New Yorker last summer. Her style resonates, Petrusich said, "in a cultural moment when we are all trying very hard to sort out real people from the ones who are merely savvy and ambitious enough to know the right way to curate and present an authentic-seeming vibe."
Eilish's apparent realness has inevitably snared the attention of marketers as well. Her appearance last spring in the "I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins" ad campaign contrasted sharply with previous Calvin Klein campaigns modeled by scantily clad boys and girls.
Only last month H&M sought to cash in on the impact of her socially conscious, street-inflected message, releasing a line of sustainably produced sweatshirts, supersize hoodies, bucket hats and beanies.
Eilish presents as audacious and spontaneous, if a bit candied at times. "She dresses like a Disney princess, but she doesn't sound like one," said Giana, a 10-year-old social media personality from Dallas with a shock of emerald-tone hair and an Instagram following of her own. To Giana, who goes by her first name only and dresses in Eilish-inspired clashing plaids and colors, Eilish is the mistress of brash self-invention.
"She knows you can make a look fearless," Giana said, "and she makes me feel it too."
It may jolt her to learn that Eilish once scorned wannabes, venting that resentment in her lyrics. "Copycat trying to cop my manner/ Watch your back when you can't watch mine," she taunts in "Copycat," released in 2017.
She has certainly vaunted her originality. "I could easily just be like, you know what, you're going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won't have anything to do with them," she said in a profile in The New York Times last year.
"But I'm not that kind of person and I'm not that kind of artist," she said.
She seems happy enough, all the same, to exploit an ever-widening fascination with her fashion bravura, entering into partnerships with Freak City, an online platform based in Los Angeles, and with youth-oriented stores like Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic. She has introduced a children's line on Blohsh, the Billie Eilish online store that sells vinyl albums and CDs, along with fleece blankets, socks and sweatshirts with spray-painted logos.
Some fans may chafe to discover that she has worked since she was 14 with Samantha Burkhart, a high-powered stylist whose clients include Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera and Mark Ronson. Her outfits are excessive, Burkhart said.
"She enjoys the uncomfortableness of not fitting in," she said. "That appeals to a generation that grew up sick of manufactured pop music produced in a way that follows algorithms."
Admirers perceive a more earnest intention underpinning Eilish's over-the-top appeal. "She makes ethical choices in her everyday life, from wearing ethically produced fashion to leading a vegan lifestyle," Mila said. "Many people don't take outspoken young girls such as Billie and Greta Thunberg seriously. They diminish them as being just children. But I'm grateful to have them as role models."

Texto completo: The meat of a roast chicken is all well and good, but it's the skin that I really adore. Getting it as crisp and burnished as possible is my goal for every bird; if I can hear it crackle like a potato chip, I know I've gotten close.
Strategies for achieving this abound. You can leave the bird uncovered in the fridge overnight, or blast it with a hair dryer. You can rub it down with salt or baking powder or both. Some cooks recommend separating the skin from the flesh, poking holes as you go to release the fat. All of these methods work, to varying degrees.
But the fastest, simplest and perhaps most delicious way to get chicken skin as crunchy as a strip of fried bacon is to turn it into a giant frico -- that is, to coat the bird with enough grated Parmesan so that, as it roasts, the skin turns into one big, salty, schmaltz-infused cheese wafer.
However, it did take a few tries to get it right. Its ultimate success depends on when you apply the cheese. Add it too early, and it burns a little, imbuing the meat with a scorched flavor. Sprinkle it on too late, and the skin gets more leathery than crisp. I found that adding the cheese halfway through roasting was perfect, with the Parmesan melting and bubbling into a crackerlike coating that wraps the bird in a crisp, umami embrace. There's nothing quite like it.
With skin this good, I took the less-is-more approach with the other flavors. I mixed some fresh rosemary into the salt rub because it seemed like a natural fit for the chicken and Parmesan, and used some lemon zest for its citrus perfume. Then I added plenty of freshly ground black pepper and a big pinch of red-pepper flakes, to lend the heat and astringency necessary to cut some of the richness.
Finally, instead of making a sauce, I squeezed juice from the zested lemon into the pan drippings, and called it a day. It was as fine a dinner as I'd ever cooked, and for an easy roast chicken recipe made from simple ingredients, that's saying a lot.

Crispy Parmesan roast chicken with lemon
Makes: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 1 1/4 hours, plus marinating

1 small lemon
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chopped rosemary, plus 4 sprigs
Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving (optional)
1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, patted dry
Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan

1. Finely grate 1 teaspoon zest from the lemon and place it in a small bowl. (Save the zested lemon for the drippings.) Stir in 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, chopped rosemary and red-pepper flakes, if using. Season the chicken inside and out with salt mixture. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes or refrigerate uncovered for up to overnight.
2. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place chicken, breast-side up, in a large skillet, sheet pan or roasting pan. Stuff cavity of chicken with rosemary sprigs. Drizzle breast with a little olive oil.
3. Roast chicken for 30 minutes. Sprinkle chicken all over with Parmesan, then continue roasting until bird's juices run clear when skin is pierced with a knife and the skin is golden, 25 to 30 minutes longer.
4. Let chicken rest for 10 minutes. Squeeze juice from the zested lemon, to taste, into the pan drippings and season with more salt and red-pepper flakes if you like. Carve and serve with drippings spooned over the meat.

The essence of dumplings

Texto completo: A few years ago, I made the Russian baths a regular part of my New York life. The ritual of the shvitz -- steaming, sweating and rinsing -- is why I go (health!), but if I'm being honest, I also am very much there for the food (pleasure!).
I eat there not out of necessity, but because it's low-key and one of my favorite restaurants in town. My order changes every time -- pickles, cabbage, soup, pickled cabbage soup -- but I always get the pelmeni, tortellini-size dumplings filled with pork, served in a squat ramekin, coated in melted butter and a splash of the cooking liquid. Finished with caramelized onions, lots of dill and a generous portion of sour cream alongside, they are kind of the opposite of a healthy trip to the spa -- unless you consider mental health a part of that journey. (I do.)
Every time I eat those little miracles, I can't stop thinking about how I could write a recipe that approximates them without asking someone to make dumplings. (I'd never do that to you.)
I thought about the chewiness of the dumpling wrapper, the delicately meaty taste of the filling and slight brothiness of the liquid they come in. I thought about how necessary the dill is, and about how I always wanted a squeeze of lemon but wouldn't dare ask.
And that's how I got here: creamy farro with crispy mushrooms, sour cream and lots of dill. Yes, there is also a side of lemon.
OK, so, no: A bowl of farro and mushrooms isn't exactly a plate of dumplings, but hear me out. The way the mushrooms are cooked and crisped alongside the thinly sliced, caramelizing leeks gives them such a delightfully meaty flavor that they're almost better than meat itself. The farro, toasted in the pot before it's cooked, reinforces that vague meatiness. (Chicken broth helps, but you can use vegetable broth or even water to keep it vegetarian.) In the end, the squeaky chew of each grain coupled with the porridge-y consistency reminds me of the dumplings swimming in that buttery broth.
Topped with sour cream and a sprinkle of a lemony dill mixture, made better with the addition of chives, it hits the spot, even without the shvitz.

Creamy farro with crispy mushrooms and sour cream
Makes: 4 servings
Total time: 1 hour

1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle,
torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley
4 cups vegetable broth, chicken broth or water
1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing
Sour cream, for serving

1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the leeks and half the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and crisped, 12 to 15 minutes. (They will start giving off moisture and steaming a little before this happens, so be patient.)
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a medium bowl leaving any olive oil behind. (They will have absorbed the oil as they cook, and released it back as they crisp.) Add a bit more olive oil so there's another 1/4 cup or so in the pot. Cook the remaining leeks and mushrooms, adding them to the bowl with the other mushrooms.
3. Without wiping the pot, add farro and season with salt and pepper. Cook over that same medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until farro is toasted on the outside (it will go from pale golden brown to a toastier golden brown), about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and 2 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring to a strong simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until farro is fully cooked and most (but not all) of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. It should still look a bit loose, like risotto or a porridge. Remove from heat and add half the chives.
5. Toss dill, remaining chives and lemon zest together in a small bowl. To serve, season farro with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls. Top with sour cream, mushrooms and leeks, and dill mixture. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing.

Texto completo: It's a hard time to be a dairy farmer in America: The nationwide decline in milk consumption and the rippling effects of the trade war with China have pushed thousands of farms out of business.
Now the industry is a step closer to a major consolidation that some struggling farmers fear could cripple them even further.
In a deal that is likely to draw scrutiny from government antitrust regulators, Dairy Farmers of America, the country's largest milk cooperative, announced on Monday that it had reached an agreement to purchase a "substantial portion" of the bankrupt milk company Dean Foods.
Dairy farmers have argued that a merger would reduce competition and suppress the price of raw milk. But the co-op says its deal will help farmers by guaranteeing that there will be buyers for their milk at a time when milk consumption is declining nationwide.
Under the agreement, Dairy Farmers of America, a farmer-owned co-op, would pay $425 million to acquire 44 of Dean Food's facilities, as well as the real estate, inventory and equipment necessary to operate them. To move forward, the deal must be approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing Dean Foods as well as by regulators, who have been investigating the potential merger for months.
So far, much of the antitrust scrutiny has focused on the co-op's evolving role in the American milk business. Two decades ago, Dairy Farmers of America was founded to help small farmers market their raw milk to dairy processing companies like Dean Foods, which prepare milk for distribution to retailers.
But over the years, the co-op, which now has more than 14,000 members, has also invested heavily in processing, meaning it buys some of the raw milk that its own marketing branch sells. Those investments have created a conflict of interest, some dairy farmers argue, because processors benefit from lower milk prices, while farmers benefit from higher prices.
Dean Foods, the largest milk processor in the United States with a little under 60 manufacturing facilities and a portfolio of well-known brands like TruMoo and Lehigh Valley, filed for bankruptcy protection in November, hurt by changing consumer habits and a growing market of milk alternatives.
Dairy Farmers of America's plan to acquire a large portion of Dean Foods' assets would significantly expand its processing operations, heightening the conflict of interest, critics of the merger say.
But not all dairy farmers are opposed. And executives who negotiated the deal argue that bringing together the two milk giants will keep the market stable.
"It is important to ensure continued secure markets for our members' milk and minimal disruption to the U.S. dairy industry," Rick Smith, chief executive of Dairy Farmers of America, said in a statement Monday.
The chief executive of Dean Foods, Eric Beringause, said in a statement that Dairy Farmers of America would "serve our customers with the same commitment to quality and service they have come to expect."
The co-op has been discussing a possible acquisition of Dean Foods since shortly before the bankruptcy filing. At the same time, antitrust officials at the Justice Department have been investigating the potential merger.
The bankruptcy court in Texas that has overseen the Dean Foods case is scheduled to hold a hearing March 12 to review the possible acquisition.

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later -- or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.

Texto completo: Charles E. Hayes was a veteran reporter and editor of newspapers in Chicago's suburbs before working for many years as a Tribune real estate editor and writer.
"His writing was just awesome. He was a lovely, lovely writer and as his real estate editor, I appreciated him not just because he was an excellent writer who did not require much editing on my part, but because he also knew his subject matter so well and so deeply," said Sallie Gaines, a retired Tribune editor and reporter who for a time oversaw Hayes' work. "He was able to explain it clearly and in a manner that was interesting."
Hayes, 88, died of natural causes Feb. 4 at his home, said a longtime friend, Steve Novick. Hayes, who had lived in Palatine for the past 27 years and before that had resided in Arlington Heights, had been battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure.
Born in Evanston, Hayes grew up in Park Ridge and graduated from Maine Township High School. He received a bachelor's degree in education from Wittenberg College in 1953 and a master's degree from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in 1955.
Hayes' journalism career started in 1954 when Arlington Heights-based Paddock Publications hired him as a reporter for a group of weekly newspapers that were the predecessors to the Daily Herald. Hayes was promoted to news editor and then to managing editor in 1957. He later became executive editor and editor-in-chief of Paddock's chain of weekly newspapers, which eventually increased their publishing frequency to tri-weekly and then to daily.
As Chicago's suburbs continued to grow, Hayes was at the forefront of increasingly serious journalism covering the suburbs. In 1958, Hayes coauthored an award-winning series, "Shame of the Suburbs," which focused on Mexican Americans in Chicago's northwest suburbs and won an Illinois Press Association community service award.
In 1962, Hayes and a Paddock photographer spent almost five months examining living conditions for the elderly in Illinois for a series titled "These Lonely Rooms." The series entailed visits to farms, cities, nursing homes and boarding houses.
"That's where the action is today," Hayes told Illinois Issues magazine in October 1978, referring to suburban areas. "People no longer buy a newspaper to get the hot spot news. From their newspaper they want local news, local information, local service and local leadership."
In 1975, the Tribune hired Hayes to oversee its Suburban Trib news supplements, which included 31 editions a week in nine editorial zones. Based in Hinsdale, Hayes was the Suburban Trib's editor from 1975 until 1982. In the role, Hayes tapped Bill Geist, who would go on to be a New York Times columnist and CBS News correspondent, as the Suburban Trib's main news columnist.
"Chuck Hayes was way ahead of his time in understanding the complexity of suburbia and giving it the deep and nuanced journalistic coverage it deserved," said former Suburban Trib reporter Sam Freedman, now a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. "In his years leading (the) Suburban Trib, Chuck set such a high standard that newspapers such as the Miami Herald and the New York Times took note of his model in improving their own suburban coverage."
Former Tribune financial editor and editorial board member Pat Widder, who worked for Hayes on the Suburban Trib for six years, recalled Hayes' willingness to advocate for her when she was eager for a promotion.
"He stood by his people and certainly went to bat for me," Widder said. "He was quirky and unapologetic about it. I always respected that."
In 1982, Hayes joined the Tribune's editorial board, writing about suburban governmental and political issues. The following year, he was tapped to fill the Tribune's newly created position of real estate editor.
"We spent quite a few hours in those real estate years touring suburban housing developments and I came to know him as a thoughtful person with an oftentimes sharp wit who could converse on virtually any topic," said former Tribune real estate editor Steve Kerch, who also worked with Hayes on the Suburban Trib. "(And) he had a knack for spotting talent -- making Bill Geist the Suburban Trib's main columnist is Exhibit A there -- and unleashing it to the benefit of readers across the metropolitan area."
Retired Tribune real estate reporter John Handley worked closely with Hayes for a decade.
"Much of downtown Chicago was exploding with high-rise condos and massive suburban residential developments seemed to be announced every week," Handley said. "We had more than enough to write about. He always communicated his special insights about the real estate industry. Chuck was incisive at analyzing the pros and cons of all the new model homes he toured."
After retiring from the Tribune in 1994, Hayes wrote a column on new homes for the suburban Copley Newspapers chain from 1994 until 2008.
Hayes served a stint as the president of the Chicago Headline Club and from 1975 until 1982 was an appointee to the Illinois Health Facilities Authority, which issued tax-exempt bonds for nonprofit health care institutions.
Hayes was a volunteer with the Salvation Army for 46 years.
He is survived by two nieces, Diane Zajac and Lisa Pozzi.
Services were held.

Texto completo: Chicago politicians and immigrant advocates vowed to push back against plans by President Donald Trump's administration to deploy tactical units from the southern border to strengthen immigration enforcement in Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities.
U.S. Rep. Jesús "Chuy" García contended the timing of the initiative was intended to "instill fear" in immigrants not just about deportation but about participating in the 2020 census.
"The timing is no accident," García said at a news conference Tuesday. "The attempted intimidation has a clear purpose: It is to intimidate our neighbors who are Latino, African American, Asian American communities in particular, not to open their doors. Trump succeeds if we do that. Trump wants us to be undercounted in our communities so that we would lose federal resources and services that are vital to our communities and weaken our political power."
Households across the country will start to receive mail by March 12 from the U.S. Census Bureau with instructions on how to fill out the questionnaire by phone, mail or internet. Workers hired by the federal agency will start visiting households that haven't responded on their own by April, according to the bureau. In Chicago, community organizations have already started knocking on doors, trying to inform residents about the decennial count and to figure out how many people need help filling out the questionnaire.
Outreach groups doing work around the 2020 census had already expressed concern about the willingness of immigrants to participate because of Trump's attempt to include a citizenship question. The questionnaire will not ask anyone about their immigration status.
The new enforcement tactic and the response by local officials marked an escalation of the long-running conflict between the Trump administration and leaders of cities like Chicago, where state and local laws prohibit police from assisting in immigration enforcement or from stopping anyone because of their immigration status.
"We will not be bullied, period, especially by a bully like President Trump who trades in hatred and scare tactics," Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a video she released following news last week about the new enforcement effort. "To all our neighbors and friends, I want you to know that Chicago stands with you and will always fight to keep you safe. We are a welcoming city and proud of it, and no amount of vitriol will make us think otherwise."
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials told The New York Times last week that the agency will divert 100 officers to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cities around the country "in order to enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security."
In Chicago, ICE officials previously said arrests are down in the area because state and local officials are no longer cooperating with them. An ICE official earlier this year said the agency no longer has access to databases in Illinois that it previously used to track noncitizens, and local jails denied more than 1,000 detainers the agency issued during fiscal 2019.
Federal officials have also argued that the lack of cooperation has led to a greater public risk, leading to collateral arrests or costing residents more if the person gets arrested again.
But García described the administration's latest move as a "radical departure" for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said the fear of ICE has already deterred victims of violent crime from showing up in court out of fear that immigration enforcement officers could be waiting for them outside the courthouse.
Foxx said that's why her office joined the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights in suing the Trump administration over the "public charge" rule, which could deny green cards to immigrants in the country legally who receive a form of public aid.
While the U.S. Supreme Court in January allowed the Trump administration to move forward with the new rule, an injunction in Illinois remains in effect. The county's federal lawsuit is still pending as of this week.
"Our office will be going to the Supreme Court once again to fight to make sure that these racist policies don't take hold," Foxx said at the news conference.
At the state level, advocates are pushing for legislators to pass a bill that would further prevent local officials from cooperating with ICE, said Mony Ruiz-Velasco, executive director of the PASO West Suburban Action Project
As they did last year when Trump warned of a crackdown on those without legal residency, immigrant advocates are also promoting a know-your-rights campaign, advising people not to open their doors or speak to federal agents, to have a safety plan in place and to ask during a traffic stop if the officer is local or federal.
"Chicagoans have heard these threats before from the Trump administration," the National Immigrant Justice Center said in a release. "As a legal service organization committed to defending our Chicago neighbors, NIJC's message to communities remains the same: Everyone in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, has rights under the U.S. Constitution. "We encourage families to ... prepare for a potential encounter with immigration officers and understand their rights."
Emma Lozano, a community activist, called for the community to stand together, pointing out that many people lived in so-called mixed status households, meaning some family members could be living in the country illegally while others are U.S. citizens.
"We must prepare ourselves by knowing our rights," Lozano said, as she urged people to register to vote and participate in the census.
Garcia said Tuesday that he had not heard of any sightings so far of the specialized units in cities like Chicago.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump publicly objected Tuesday to efforts within his own administration to restrict the sales of U.S. technology to China because of national security concerns, insisting that such fears are an "excuse" and that the United States is open for business.
The comments, posted on Twitter, appeared to represent a striking reversal of the Trump administration's aspirations to curb China's ascent as a global leader in technology and came as Cabinet officials were scheduled to meet later this month to discuss restrictions on China.
That Feb. 28 meeting was expected to include a discussion about whether to halt sales to China of an aircraft engine produced in part by General Electric by blocking its license to export the technology. Officials were also expected to consider new rules that would further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to U.S. technology.
But Tuesday, Trump seemed to preemptively scuttle such moves, and two people familiar with the matter said that the meeting was on hold and that the U.S. would not block GE's ability to sell jet engine parts to China.
"The United States cannot, & will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive," Trump wrote. "We want to sell product and goods to China and other countries."
The president went on to say that if the United States does not sell its products for national security reasons, then other countries will step in and do so. Trump explicitly referenced the jet engine sales.
"As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World," he said. "I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous."
Trump said he has made this sentiment clear to everyone in his administration.
The administration's efforts to restrict the flow of U.S. technology to China has triggered objections from companies, who say it undermines their ability to compete on a global scale. Firms say they have already taken steps to limit the U.S. components in their products and may begin to do more research and development outside the United States.
General Electric, in response to media reports Saturday about the administration's review of its export license, said in a statement that it would comply with any requirements imposed by the United States but downplayed concerns about the risks of sales to China.
"We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests," General Electric said in a statement.
Geng Shuang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, criticized the U.S. proposal to halt the jet engine deliveries during a news conference Tuesday.

He's in a cab franc state of mind

Texto completo: Tasting one particular sort of wine over the course of many vintages is like reading a series of books by the same author. Their quality may vary, but they will all enlighten.
Such a deep dive, known in the wine world as a vertical tasting, helps to convey how a wine expresses the different conditions of each vintage, and shows whether it articulates a consistent sense of place despite the yearly variations.
Recently, however, I attended a tasting that examined neither a particular wine through the years nor a specific site. Instead, it was a vertical of one man's journey through the wine business, making cabernet francs in New York state over 25 years, both on the North Fork of Long Island and in the Finger Lakes.
The man, Bruce Schneider, is not particularly well known, but he has done a lot in wine, from farming to production to marketing and sales to innovation, foreseeing more ecologically sustainable methods of selling and transporting wine.
Schneider and I met in mid-December in Manhattan, where we tasted 25 cabernet francs he had produced from 1994 through 2018.
The wines included his first efforts for Schneider Vineyards on the North Fork, perhaps grandiosely named by Schneider and his wife-to-be in 1994, Christiane Baker, as they owned no vines at the time.
They included bottles from Onabay Vineyards, also on the North Fork, where he is the consulting winemaker; from Gotham Project, in which he and his partner, Charles Bieler, have pioneered selling wine in reusable steel kegs, now in more than 40 states; from Schneider & Bieler, their label for Finger Lakes cabernet franc; and from Empire Builder Return & Reuse, a forthcoming project involving reusable bottles.
Why the focus on cabernet franc? It was an early sign of Schneider's confidence in his talent for identifying what might not be an obvious winner but one that could pay off in the long run. Such assurance comes from a family background in wine.
Schneider, a boyish-looking 50, grew up in Springfield, New Jersey, the grandson of a bootlegger and the son of a wine-and-spirits distributor.
Something clicked, and for a high school work-study program, with help from his family, he interned in Burgundy, where he learned from Becky Wasserman, the noted American wine broker; Chartron & Trebuchet, a producer; and François Mikulski, then a recent wine school graduate who has gone on to establish his own Burgundy domaine.
In 1994, Schneider was determined to make his own wine. He and Baker scraped together $20,000, bought a few tons of grapes, which they picked by hand, and persuaded a Long Island producer, Kip Bedell of Bedell Cellars in Cutchogue, to help them make the wine, using the Bedell facilities.
"Kip did all the work," Schneider said, "but we knew we wanted to learn, and we did, hands on."
They continued to work with Bedell through 1999, and while the vintage characters differ, the wines all seemed to me a little rustic, perhaps because of a touch of brettanomyces, a nettlesome yeast that can add flavors that range from barnyard to Band-Aid. In small quantities it can add complexity; too much, and it can be overbearing.
In 2000, they started working with Sean Capiaux, a California winemaker who also consulted on Long Island. And they started to make their wines at Premium Wine Group, which provides equipment to small producers who do not have their own facilities.
Another change came in 2001 when Schneider decided to make a Loire-style 100% cabernet franc. He called it Le Breton, a Loire synonym for cabernet franc, and, unlike his blended cab francs, which received prolonged barrel age, the Breton was bottled before the next harvest.
The 2001 was delightful 18 years later, lively, energetic and joyous, with pretty flavors of dark fruits. With this wine, Schneider was ahead of his time, anticipating the American stylistic swing a decade later toward lighter wines based on acidic liveliness rather than on the power of fruit and oak.
In 1998, Schneider and Baker, who by then had married, bought a potato farm in Riverhead and planted it with numerous clones of cabernet franc, as well as some cuttings of cab franc and merlot that had originally come from Vieux Château Certan, a famed Pomerol estate.
The 2003 Breton was the first wine I tasted made entirely from fruit grown in their vineyard. It was earthy, minerally and savory, not concentrated but lasting on the palate. The '04 Breton was cool, breezy and delicious. Then came 2005, a landmark Long Island vintage.
"It was the most crazy, freaky, incredible vintage I've ever experienced," Schneider said. At one point that October, it rained 17 inches in eight days, leaving the grapes swollen with water. Then, miraculously came 10 clear, dry days, which dried them out. Schneider, who at this point had taken over most of the winemaking, made several unusual cuvees that year.
La Bouchet, his Bordeaux-style wine, was complex, rich and earthy, with fine tannins and lovely red fruit flavors. He also made a one-off, La Cloche, exclusively from the Vieux Château cuttings, a floral, pretty, high-toned wine that was structured yet delicate.
By 2005, however, Schneider and Baker had already decided to sell the vineyard. With a daughter, Chloe, they preferred to live in New York City. As good as the vineyard had turned out to be, it was also too much for them to manage.
The 2007 Breton, balanced and pleasing, was the last wine in the tasting made from estate fruit and the last vintage sold under the Schneider Vineyards label.
Schneider then took a job with Onabay, which had bought a vineyard on Peconic Bay in 2006 and replanted 7 acres using Schneider's research on cabernet franc.
In 2010, Schneider began Gotham Project with Bieler, selling wine in reusable kegs to restaurants.
Gotham originally emphasized New York state wines, but it now includes wines from around the world. The partners also began bottling cabernet franc from the Finger Lakes in 2015, a move west that came as the Finger Lakes were becoming the most exciting place in New York for wine.
Cabernet franc is now a leading red grape on Long Island and in the Finger Lakes. It cannot be attributed to Schneider alone, but he has been among those who have demonstrated the grape's potential.
As for the future, Schneider will continue to make wine from both areas.
I've already tasted a sample of the 2018 Finger Lakes cabernet franc: Be assured, it's a good one.

Texto completo: We should talk about minute 24.
It's the moment on "The Daily," the New York Times podcast, when reporter Megan Twohey asks Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney, Donna Rotunno, if she's ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno answers. "I have not. Because I would never put myself in that position."
Twohey, co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which chronicles the Weinstein story from start to publication, pauses.
"So you're saying - actually, I'm sorry," Twohey says after a beat. "So you're saying that you have never been sexually assaulted because you would never put yourself in the position of being sexually assaulted?"
"No," Rotunno answers. "I've always made choices, from college-age on, where I never drank too much, I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Ever."
Rotunno has a role to play, and she's not going to go off-script during an interview with the reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting that took down her client. Rotunno's job is to cast doubt on Weinstein's accusers. Her answer attempts to do just that.
But it also propels an ugly myth about assault that we need to push back on when it rears its ugly head.
Rape is not caused by poor choices. Rape is caused by rapists.
You can try to minimize your risks of being raped, just as you can try to minimize your risks of becoming the victim of any number of violent crimes. But that's not always enough. And if it has, for you, been enough, you are also the beneficiary of some very good luck.
Good luck to have been born into a home in which no one preyed upon you. Far, far too many children aren't so lucky.
Good luck to have never crossed paths with a predatory coach or mentor or youth group leader or priest or classmate or instructor or medical practitioner or boss.
Good luck to have not been the victim of spousal rape.
Good luck to have never been abducted.
Good luck to have gone through life, so far, without someone using their power - power in the form of a weapon, power in the form of physical size, power in the form of authority - to rob you of your bodily agency.
I wish every woman and man, girl and boy had such luck. They don't.
Maybe Rotunno subscribes to the just-world fallacy - the belief that we live in a morally fair society, and people who encounter misfortune likely had some hand in causing that fate. That's certainly easier than accepting that terrible things sometimes just happen. Unprovoked. Unjustly.
Or maybe she answered in the way that felt, to her, as honest as possible while still being as strategic as possible.
Regardless, her answer was toxic.
Because it adds to the already far too prevalent messages that assault survivors are slapped in the face with repeatedly: that they could have prevented their assault, that they had some hand in causing their assault, that they should have known better than to become a victim of assault.
It contributes to a culture of doubt and denial and blame that victims have to navigate when deciding whether to come forward with their stories - stories that, if they are heard and heeded, can save more people from being victimized. How many athletes may have been spared Larry Nassar's reign of terror if coaches and parents and college administrators acted as soon as the gymnasts in his care started speaking up?
And it slows us down from learning what we really need to grasp and understand about sexual assault: that it is, above all, an abhorrent abuse of power. It is a stripping away of another person's autonomy. It is a debasing of that person's humanity. It says, "I matter. You don't."
No one puts themselves in that position. To surrender their autonomy and humanity. To not matter.
Rotunno is doing her job. Maybe it will work in court; maybe it won't.
But when her words float into the national dialogue as they did on that podcast, the rest of us get to make our own judgment. The rest of us get to reject that (il)logic.
The rest of us get to overrule that kind of toxic messaging and make sure it doesn't find a safe place to land and grow and spread.

New Boy Scouts trail: Bankruptcy National group files for Chapter 11 amid sex abuse lawsuits

Texto completo: Hoping to contain a growing deluge of sexual abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America took shelter in bankruptcy court Tuesday, filing for Chapter 11 protection that will let it keep operating while it grapples with serious questions about whether the century-old Scouting movement has a viable future.
The bankruptcy filing affects only the national organization, not the state and local councils that run Scouting programs day to day. Even so, the case sets up one of the most complex and uncertain financial restructurings in American history. Thousands of people have already lodged allegations that they were abused as Scouts, and many more are expected to come forward.
The Boy Scouts, whose mission to promote patriotism, courage, self-reliance and kindred virtues was enshrined in a rare congressional charter in 1916, said it plans to continue its work "for many years to come."
The bankruptcy court in Delaware that is handling the case is likely to freeze the lawsuits against the group and set a deadline for filing any more claims. But Jim Turley, the group's national chairman, said in an open letter to victims of sexual abuse that the Boy Scouts were not trying to dodge responsibility for compensating them. Instead, he said, the organization wanted to do so as equitably as possible through a victim's compensation trust, rather than piecemeal in lawsuit after lawsuit.
"I want you to know that we believe you, we believe in compensating you, and we have programs in place to pay for counseling for you and your family by a provider of your choice," Turley said.
Tim Kosnoff, a lawyer for an Abused in Scouting group that now has close to 2,000 clients, said that while he's open to hearing how the Boy Scouts intends to reform itself, he finds it "difficult to impossible" to envision the organization operated in a restructured form.
"It would require changing into something people wouldn't recognize as Scouting," said Kosnoff, noting the organization's history of sending boys on remote outings with volunteer leaders.
Over the span of a century, more than 130 million Americans have participated in the Boy Scouts. But membership has been dwindling in recent decades, as shifting attitudes pulled many families away from the God-and-country oaths and outdoorsy survival skills that Scouting offered. Then, in more recent years, lawsuits brought to light a long history of sexual abuse problems that the organization strove to keep secret.
The Boy Scouts have maintained internal files about abuse cases at their headquarters almost since the group was founded in 1910s. In a 1935 article in The New York Times, the organization described having files on hundreds of people who had been leaders in the Scouts but had been labeled "degenerates." In recent years, an expert hired by the organization reviewed decades of records and reported that there were nearly 8,000 "perpetrators."
The Boy Scouts fought the release of some of the files in an Oregon case in the early 2000s - a case that led a jury to hold the Scouts liable for $18.5 million in punitive damages in 2010. The records in that case stayed private until a ruling from the Oregon Supreme Court in 2012 made them public.
Paul Mones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, said he recalled musing with a colleague that those files might be the tip of an iceberg that could ultimately drive the Boy Scouts toward bankruptcy. But instead of trying to establish a compensation fund for victims over the years, he said, the organization continued trying to protect its reputation.
Mones expressed concern that the bankruptcy filing Tuesday would rob other victims of the opportunity to hold the Scouts accountable in court. "The justice that they so well-deserved will unfortunately escape them in the end,," he said.
Last year, the Abused in Scouting group began advertising around the country for people who were abused as Scouts to come forward and found nearly 2,000 people with complaints. The clients range in age from 8 to 93. Kosnoff said hundreds of the claimants are people who do not appear in the Boy Scouts' internal files.
With the group now seeking bankruptcy protection, Kosnoff said, "If you've ever considered coming forward, now is the time."
Over the years, the Boy Scouts held a singular position in the shaping of American boyhood, with a Scout law that demands loyalty, obedience and reverence. Former Scouts who rose to prominence include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford, astronaut Neil Armstrong, civil rights icon Ernest Green and film director Steven Spielberg.
But the group, which had around 5 million members in the 1970s, has only half that number now. In response, the Boy Scouts have tried to shift closer to evolving societal norms. Membership requirements were changed to allow openly gay Scouts in 2013 and then openly gay leaders in 2015. The Boy Scouts expanded to allow girls to participate starting in 2017. But the legal pressures from past sexual abuse continued to mount.
Other organizations in crisis over similar legacies of sexual abuse and secrecy have also sought bankruptcy protection, including Roman Catholic dioceses and USA Gymnastics.
Victims and their lawyers have argued that by hiding abuse problems in confidential files, the Boy Scouts left Scouts at risk. The Boy Scouts of America has said that it adopted safeguards over the years to require background checks for volunteers, mandatory training and a policy that prohibits one-on-one situations between children and adults.
Statutes of limitations have been a problem for many people who were sexually abused early in life in any context, including Scouting. But several states have moved to temporarily set those limitations aside, opening windows of time for victims of sexual abuse to file claims that would otherwise be disallowed. A new state law in New York opened a one-year window last summer; New Jersey opened a two-year window in December.

Texto completo: While Chinese restaurants in Chinatowns across the country are reporting a slowing stream of customers post-coronavirus outbreak, Salinas Chinese restaurants are not seeing the same vacant booths.
Chinatowns in San Francisco, New York and elsewhere show some restaurants saying they have lost 50% to 70% of their business because of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, the New York Times reported.
However, those who own and run Chinese restaurants in Salinas say they may have seen a bit of a slowdown, but they are not yet worried about their livelihoods.
Daisey Tan is one of the owners of Cantonese Express Food, a Chinese restaurant in South Salinas that's been open for more than a decade. She hung out near the passthrough to the kitchen, bagging and calling out take-out orders Monday.
"Orange chicken?" she asked two men seated at the front table, their faces buried in their phones.
Although Daisey says their business primarily attracts regulars who haven't changed their habits in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China, she worries people will associate her family's restaurant with the coronavirus.
She makes sure to point out the framed write-ups of the restaurant, hanging next to signed gold seal reports from the Monterey County Health Department for the years 2018 and 2020.
"We make good food," she said.
Her regulars echo the sentiment.
Gus Martinez, who lives in South Salinas, has been coming by Cantonese Food Express for spicy green bean chicken since his then-high-school aged daughter introduced him to the restaurant.
"I love the place," said Martinez, citing the food and the staff's kindness. Avoiding one of his favorite restaurants because of the coronavirus never crossed his mind, he said.
Kevin Tan, Daisey's nephew, cooks in the kitchen and manages the business.
"We can feel the lunchtime is not busy like before," he said, leaning up against the wall next to the board with lunch specials written in dry-erase marker.
However, a regular visitor to the Bay Area, he said the dip in business in Salinas is nothing like what he's seen in Chinatowns north of here, where the stores and restaurants are empty.
"The income, the rent, the employees," said Kevin. "That's first what we worry about."
It's led to a small drop in income, Kevin said, but sustainable. If this keeps up for three or four months, he said, the restaurant might need to revisit some of its expenses.
Across the plaza from Cantonese Food Express, Rudy Lee, the manager of AA Buffet, said he'd seen something similar. While regulars were still happily coming in to purchase a ticket to the buffet, "you get less tourists," he said.
"But the locals are pretty much the same," added Lee.
Business isn't the only thing on Lee's mind.
While his employees' families are in the U.S., Lee, who is from Taiwan, said he is worried about his friends who live all over Asia. Although he's been in the U.S. for ten years, he still has close ties to people in Korea, Japan, Thailand and elsewhere, and it's been worrying him.
"I hope they can get it contained and get the medicine," Lee said of the virus.
Monterey Chamber of Commerce CEO Paul Farmer had not heard of any business loss attributable to the coronavirus from associates of the chamber.
"It would be kind of bizarre," said Farmer. "Obviously there are going to be secondary impacts in how this is impacting Europe, China and the world economy, so that will impact us indirectly.
"I would say personally that we tend to overfocus in our society on certain problems," said Farmer. "For example, people have said the flu is killing a lot more people and is a more clear and present danger than the coronavirus and yet because the flu is always there, people are ignoring it."
Americans are more likely to die from the flu than the coronavirus. There have been 22 million flu cases, leading to 210,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 deaths from the flu so far this season, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The vast majority of the more than 60,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and at least 1,370 deaths have been in China's Hubei province.
Outside of mainland China, there have been at least 570 confirmed cases from 25 countries and territories; and three deaths, one each in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.
In the U.S., 15 people have tested positive for the virus: eight in California, two in Illinois, and one each in Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Texas, and the state of Washington, where the patient has been discharged. Most of the cases in the U.S. involved people who had visited Wuhan, where the first cases were reported in December.
Spenser Smith is a member of the chamber through his business, ARCPoint labs of Monterey Bay, a company that conducts blood tests. Smith, who is half Chinese, has been sending his grandparents in Taiwan medical supplies they are running low on, such as gloves or masks.
He had to postpone a trip to the island to visit his maternal grandparents during the outbreak, after they said they would feel safer if he didn't visit.
While Smith hadn't seen any instances of overt racial profiling on the local level — people avoiding Chinese restaurants for fear of contracting the coronavirus, for example — he had seen some online accusations go viral about Panda Express.
"It's sick," he said, of people attempting to use fear of the coronavirus to promote themselves or their brand.
"Being Asian, it's a different kind of racial stereotyping that happens," Smith said. "It's so different from things you hear about police profiling of others that I try not to be oversensitive when it happens to my racial category."
Still, Smith said, avoiding Chinese restaurants may not be something people are consciously doing.
"It's silly and crazy, but it happens, and it's not even always overt. If you're given the option and it reminds you of that situation, you just steer away."

Texto completo: PORT ST. LUCIE – Mickey Wright was the greatest female golfer.
She had the most perfect golf swing.
She was the most important player on the LPGA Tour.
I say all those things without having her seen her play. I say all those things because that's what the game's greatest players said about her, legends such as Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Kathy Whitworth.
Golf and the Treasure Coast lost a big piece of history Monday when Mary Kathryn "Mickey" Wright died at 85 after a heart attack. She passed away in Port St. Lucie, where she had lived since 1974.
Mickey and I had a unique relationship. Not only had I never seen her play, I never met her.
I called her in 2003 when I was the golf writer for the Palm Beach Post and, much to my surprise, she answered the phone. I fully expected the call to go to a recording and I would never hear back.
But there was Mickey's voice. We chatted for a while, about Annika Sorenstam's decision to play against the men in the PGA Tour's Colonial tournament, about the sport and about her life. I was talking to a legend like she was a friend.
Mickey ended the conversation with a warning, however: "Craig, I'll talk to you whenever you call, but if you ever try to come see me, I'll never talk to you again."
OK.
I never did try and find where Wright lived, just off the Saints course in Club Med. I wasn't stupid.
As I looked closer at her career and her life, I understood why she required her privacy. When she joined the LPGA Tour in 1955, it was barely a blip on anyone's radar.
Few fans cared about women's golf in the 1950s. But Mickey changed that. Her swing was so elegant, her game so tight, her mind so focused.
She was the Tiger Woods of the LPGA Tour. Fittingly, both have 82 career titles on their main tour and attended Stanford.
Mickey won 79 of her 82 career LPGA titles during a 12-year span from 1957-68, averaging 10 wins a season from 1960-64. She is the only woman to have held the four major titles at one time.
But the pressures to play and win every week forced Mickey to virtually retire at the age of 34. If Mickey didn't play, nobody cared about the tournament.
Sound familiar?
All Mickey wanted to do was hit a golf ball, not stand in front of a microphone or a camera. When I asked her if she ever thought about playing against the men, like Annika was doing, I already knew the answer.
"Golf is show business today," Mickey said. "If you start with that premise and believe in that, then anything goes. It's hard to know how you feel when you're being promoted by the promoters. I'm not into that."
When Mickey played in her last official tournament in 1994, LPGA players flocked to her gallery when their round was over. It was like an opportunity to see the magical Oz. Mickey's last public appearance was in 1996, almost a quarter century before her death.
I knew how fortunate I was to be able to talk to Mickey on the phone. I didn't call her often, maybe two or three times a year, and would always learn something new about her.
Here's one of her best golf tips: Mickey said Billy Casper, who like her grew up in San Diego, told her to practice putting at dusk, when you have to rely more on your feeling than your eyes.
Port St. Lucie was the perfect town for Mickey to spend the back nine of her life. It was quiet and peaceful, with a golf course out her back door. A ranger at the course once brought her a strip of synthetic turf so Mickey could hit balls without taking more than a few steps.
When my son Eric almost died in 2005 after a bacterial infection, Mickey wrote me a long letter saying how she was praying for Eric. Who writes letters anymore?
Two years later, I received a phone call from Mickey's longtime manager, Peggy Wilson, who gave me some bad news: Mickey had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery.
"Mickey might be mad at me for doing this, but I know she would want you to know," Wilson said.
I broke the story about Mickey's breast cancer, but there was no celebration for this national scoop.
Mickey recovered from the cancer and continued to play the stock market, do the New York Times crossword puzzle and watch golf on TV.
When she was named the 2010 Bob Jones Award winner, the USGA's highest honor, I asked her if she would do an interview on a radio show I co-hosted.
Mickey hesitated but finally said yes, only because she felt it would be good for the USGA. A few years later, I asked her to do another radio show. She said no.
I never asked again.
It's been more than a year since I heard Mickey's voice, and I'm saddened I'll never hear it again. I don't think it was a coincidence I was covering the PGA Women's Stroke Play Championship in Port St. Lucie on Monday, the day she passed.
She may have been the best female player with the best swing and the pressure of the fledgling tour riding on her. But she was so much more.
She was one of golf's greatest treasures.

Democratic primary still looks muddled

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in a little less than a month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states — including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls — will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month — especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the front-runner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The front-runner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio — probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in — largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may — or may not — score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."
Field organizers Chadd Smith, 30, and Navo Emmanuel, 23, walk through a residential neighborhood passing out leaflets.

Texto completo: NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt will deliver Rutgers University's commencement address in May, the university's board of governors voted on Tuesday.
Holt, known for his trademark on-the-ground reporting style, will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree when he speaks at the 254th anniversary commencement May 17 at SHI Stadium in Piscataway.
Holt said he is "incredibly honored" for the opportunity to speak to students in the Class of 2020.
During his brief break from covering the 2020 election to speak to Rutgers graduates, Holt expects to address online communications in polarizing times and how they impact journalism.
"As so many of us assume the role of 'citizen journalists' via social media, we have to assume the responsibility that comes with it," he said.
Holt has been recognized with numerous honors, including multiple Emmy Awards and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism award. In 2019, he was honored with the prestigious Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.
Hip-hop radio DJ and recording artist Angie Martinez will deliver the keynote address at Rutgers University-Newark's commencement May 20 at Prudential Center, where she'll also receive an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree.
Martinez is a pioneer in popularizing hip-hop music, having earned a Grammy nomination in the genre in 1997 and having established herself as one of its leading on-air radio personalities through her shows on stations Hot 97 and then Power 105.1, as well as iHeartMedia.com.
"... Ms. Martinez knows our students, loves our students, and inspires – and is inspired by – our students. She is an ideal commencement speaker and honorary degree recipient from Rutgers-Newark," Rutgers-Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor said.
New York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, American Bar Association President Judy Martinez, and state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli will receive honorary degrees and speak at Rutgers University-Camden's commencement at the BB&T Pavilion May 20-21.
"Rutgers-Camden is proud to present honorary degrees to three prominent advocates for equality during commencement this year," Rutgers-Camden Chancellor Phoebe A. Haddon said.
Hannah-Jones, an award-winning investigative reporter who covers civil rights and racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine, will receive a Doctor of Letters degree at the College of Arts and Sciences ceremony May 20.
Martinez, president of one of the world's largest voluntary professional organizations, with nearly 400,000 members and more than 3,500 entities, will receive a Doctor of Laws degree at the Rutgers Law School ceremony May 21.
Persichilli, a registered nurse with vast experience leading hospitals across New Jersey who was confirmed as commissioner last month, will receive a Doctor of Science degree at the Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden ceremony May 20.

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in a little less than a month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states – including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls – will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month – especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the front-runner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The front-runner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio – probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in – largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may – or may not – score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices throughout the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government – including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland – who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Blues legend heirs seek end to lawyers' fee

Texto completo: "My Daddy had an 8th-grade education. He didn't know what he was signing. He was a gravel truck driver."
Michael Johnson
Legend has it he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his talent as a blues musician, but few would hear his music. He mysteriously died at age 27 and didn't become famous during his lifetime. Even though he only recorded 29 songs, the royalties from his music are in the millions and the law firm which proved who was the rightful heir is still being paid for its services 20 years later.
"That litigation went on from 1991 to 1999, actually, when the appeal came through," said Michael Johnson of Crystal Springs. "It was settled in the Chancery Court in Greenwood, Miss. So, it actually was a 10-year battle from the beginning to the end."
The battle was determining if Michael's father, Claud Johnson, was the biological child of blues legend Robert Johnson and rightful heir. Claud had always known he was the son of the blues musician who died in 1938, but had no idea his recordings were generating a small fortune until someone came knocking at his door.
"The guy contacted my father and said, 'You know, the music has come back into popularity,' and they wanted to know the legitimacy of the birth certificate found down at the courthouse," Michael said. "He told him his father's money was generating royalties and he might want to look into it."
According to Michael Johnson, the royalties were being paid to a relative of Robert's, but should have been paid to Claud as he was the only known descendant. So, Claud hired a law firm in Crystal Springs, Kitchens & Ellis, to prove in court he was Robert Johnson's son and rightful heir. The agreement was this: if the firm won Claud's case, it would receive 40 percent of any money received from Robert's music both initially and in the future.
Today, Michael Johnson has gone to the Mississippi Supreme Court to appeal the royalty agreement his father struck with attorneys – a deal that paid the attorneys a percentage of Robert Johnson's royalties for years.
'My Daddy had an 8th-grade education.' Michael Johnson has been the administrator of the funds since Claud's death in 2015. He is now frustrated because although the family's share is more than $3 million, he feels 20 years of payments totaling more than $2 million to the firm, which is now the Kitchens Law Firm, is enough.
"To this day they're still receiving 40 percent of the royalties," Michael said. "That is not right.
"That contract shouldn't last forever. It's time for that to end."
Michael also said he feels his father didn't understand the contract with Kitchens and Ellis.
"My Daddy had an 8th-grade education," Michael Johnson said. "He didn't know what he was signing. He was a gravel truck driver."
However, the court system has so far disagreed with Michael and other members of his family. The Chancery Court in Copiah County ruled against arguments stating the contract should be nullified. In 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
Appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court The case has now been filed with the Mississippi Supreme Court, but Michael has reservations about that. Jim Kitchens, who was Claud's attorney and had received contingency fees from the royalties, is a Justice in the court. Even with his recusal, Michael feels his association with the court could impact the decision.
"I want to get a fair shake in the court system about this case," Michael said. "The outcome is going to affect our family tremendously.
"We think that you have a supreme court justice that could have an adverse effect to the decision. I think they're going to be biased. They build a friendship because they are working colleagues every day."
The Clarion Ledger contacted Kitchens Law Firm and was told it would not discuss pending litigation. However, Mississippi College Law School professor Matt Steffey talked about the case and contingency fees.
Steffey disclosed that he taught Kitchens' sons in law school and his wife works as a law clerk in Kitchens' chambers, but he said that does not change the facts of legal cases involving contingency fees.
Access to justice for the ordinary person "This is not unprecedented and not particularly uncommon," Steffey said. "Having fee arrangements is not uncommon."
Some frown on attorneys charging 40 percent of what clients receive, but Steffey said there is risk involved.
"Lawyers can invest 10 years of effort and at the end of the day get nothing," Steffey said.
Steffey said such agreements are needed, even if they are long and protracted.
"Contingency agreements are the engines that drive access to justice for ordinary people," Steffey said. "Without contingency agreements, access to justice would be hard to obtain. Most ordinary people can't pay lawyers, much less for years of their work."
Michael knows that without the contingency arrangement, the family may have never received the royalties, but said it has gone on too long.
"It's been over 20 years," Michael said. "They have received well over $2 million in payment.
"They have been well compensated. I don't think the contract should continue forever."

Standing in the Robert Johnson Blues Museum, Michael Johnson, grandson of Blues legend Robert Johnson, talks about an item hanging on the wall that means a great deal to him – a Rick Bragg article printed in The New York Times on June 17, 2000, titled "Mississippian is son of father of the Blues." Michael Johnson points to his father, Claud Johnson, standing next to his mother Vergie Jane Smith Cain, in one photo.

Texto completo: Hoping to contain a growing deluge of sexual abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America took shelter in bankruptcy court Tuesday, filing for Chapter 11 protection that will let it keep operating while it grapples with serious questions about whether the century-old Scouting movement has a viable future.
The bankruptcy filing affects only the national organization, not the state and local councils that run Scouting programs day to day. Even so, the case sets up one of the most complex and uncertain financial restructurings in American history. Thousands of people have already lodged allegations that they were abused as Scouts, and many more are expected to come forward.
The Boy Scouts, whose mission to promote patriotism, courage, self-reliance and kindred virtues was enshrined in a rare congressional charter in 1916, said it plans to continue its work "for many years to come."
The bankruptcy court in Delaware that is handling the case is likely to freeze the lawsuits against the group and set a deadline for filing any more claims. But Jim Turley, the group's national chairman, said in an open letter to victims of sexual abuse that the Boy Scouts were not trying to dodge responsibility for compensating them. Instead, he said, the organization wanted to do so as equitably as possible through a victim's compensation trust, rather than piecemeal in lawsuit after lawsuit.
"I want you to know that we believe you, we believe in compensating you, and we have programs in place to pay for counseling for you and your family by a provider of your choice," Turley said.
Tim Kosnoff, a lawyer for an Abused in Scouting group that now has close to 2,000 clients, said that while he's open to hearing how the Boy Scouts intends to reform itself, he finds it "difficult to impossible" to envision the organization operated in a restructured form.
"It would require changing into something people wouldn't recognize as Scouting," said Kosnoff, noting the organization's history of sending boys on remote outings with volunteer leaders.
Over the span of a century, more than 130 million Americans have participated in the Boy Scouts. But membership has been dwindling in recent decades, as shifting attitudes pulled many families away from the God-and-country oaths and outdoorsy survival skills that Scouting offered. Then, in more recent years, lawsuits brought to light a long history of sexual abuse problems that the organization strove to keep secret.
The Boy Scouts have maintained internal files about abuse cases at their headquarters almost since the group was founded in 1910s. In a 1935 article in The New York Times, the organization described having files on hundreds of people who had been leaders in the Scouts but had been labeled "degenerates." In recent years, an expert hired by the organization reviewed decades of records and reported that there were nearly 8,000 "perpetrators."
The Boy Scouts fought the release of some of the files in an Oregon case in the early 2000s - a case that led a jury to hold the Scouts liable for $18.5 million in punitive damages in 2010. The records in that case stayed private until a ruling from the Oregon Supreme Court in 2012 made them public.
Paul Mones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, said he recalled musing with a colleague that those files might be the tip of an iceberg that could ultimately drive the Boy Scouts toward bankruptcy. But instead of trying to establish a compensation fund for victims over the years, he said, the organization continued trying to protect its reputation.
Mones expressed concern that the bankruptcy filing Tuesday would rob other victims of the opportunity to hold the Scouts accountable in court. "The justice that they so well-deserved will unfortunately escape them in the end,," he said.
Last year, the Abused in Scouting group began advertising around the country for people who were abused as Scouts to come forward and found nearly 2,000 people with complaints. The clients range in age from 8 to 93. Kosnoff said hundreds of the claimants are people who do not appear in the Boy Scouts' internal files.
With the group now seeking bankruptcy protection, Kosnoff said, "If you've ever considered coming forward, now is the time."
Over the years, the Boy Scouts held a singular position in the shaping of American boyhood, with a Scout law that demands loyalty, obedience and reverence. Former Scouts who rose to prominence include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford, astronaut Neil Armstrong, civil rights icon Ernest Green and film director Steven Spielberg.
But the group, which had around 5 million members in the 1970s, has only half that number now. In response, the Boy Scouts have tried to shift closer to evolving societal norms. Membership requirements were changed to allow openly gay Scouts in 2013 and then openly gay leaders in 2015. The Boy Scouts expanded to allow girls to participate starting in 2017. But the legal pressures from past sexual abuse continued to mount.
Other organizations in crisis over similar legacies of sexual abuse and secrecy have also sought bankruptcy protection, including Roman Catholic dioceses and USA Gymnastics.
Statutes of limitations have been a problem for many people who were sexually abused early in life in any context, including Scouting. But several states have moved to temporarily set those limitations aside, opening windows of time for victims of sexual abuse to file claims that would otherwise be disallowed because too much time had passed. A new state law in New York opened a one-year window last summer; New Jersey opened a two-year window in December.
Last month, eight men filed a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts in Washington, D.C., which had recently opened a window, contending that the national organization's ties to the city made it a valid venue for claims over abuse that occurred anywhere in the country, not just within the district.
However, the bankruptcy court may now set a much shorter deadline for new claims against the Boy Scouts of America. Kosnoff, the lawyer for Abused in Scouting, said the time limits in bankruptcy cases are often between 90 days and nine months, but he said he intended to advocate for a one-year deadline in this case.
He said he also would like to see the case lead to a robust effort to find anyone who might have a claim.

Texto completo: Hoping to contain a growing deluge of sexual abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America took shelter in bankruptcy court Tuesday, filing for Chapter 11 protection that will let it keep operating while it grapples with serious questions about the viability of the century-old Scouting movement.
The bankruptcy filing affects only the national organization, not the state and local councils that run Scouting programs day to day. Even so, the case sets up one of the most complex and uncertain financial restructurings in American history.

Democratic primary still looks muddled

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in a little less than a month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states — including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls — will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month — especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the front-runner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The front-runner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio — probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in — largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may — or may not — score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in a little less than a month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states — including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls — will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month — especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the front-runner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The front-runner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio — probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in — largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may — or may not — score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, according to the New York Times.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director as it starts to shift its focus to the March contests. Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Should you get consent on video before sex? That's a 'red flag' for some

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio – Some attorneys say written and recorded sexual consent can be the only way for people to defend themselves against accusations of rape. Advocates say that as a standard, it falls woefully short.
Two Ohio State University football players, Amir Riep, 21, and Jahsen Wint, 21, were arrested last week after being accused of kidnapping and raping a 19-year-old woman. The next day, head coach Ryan Day announced he dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police said in an affidavit that Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording. That recording was recovered, police said.

The idea of seeking “proof” of consent concerns sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates.
Football players charged: Former Ohio State players accused of rape appear in court for first time, bond set
Brad Koffel, a Columbus criminal defense attorney in private practice for more than 25 years and managing partner of Koffel Brininger Nesbitt, advises his clients to obtain written consent for sexual acts, even if it’s just a text message, or any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent.
“If they don’t,” he said, “in this climate, then they’re going to suffer some consequences. ”
This month, an attorney defending Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his trial on rape and sexual assault charges made similar suggestions.
“If I was a man in today’s world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form,” Donna Rotunno said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol of Sabol Mallory said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
“That’d be a red flag,” he said. “It might look as though they’re trying to cover their tracks. ”
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, Sabol said, but if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, the documentation of consent from a partner could increase the appearance of guilt in a suspect.
“Just because someone says it’s consensual on video doesn’t make it so,” he said.
Brandon Shroy, a Columbus criminal defense attorney, said a jury is responsible for determining the validity of a consent video.
“It’s something that defense attorneys … would love to see, but it’s something a group of jurors would choose to believe or disbelieve,” he said.
Video doesn't mean 'blanket consent'
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they see more instances of young people advised to get proof of consent, but formal documentation in writing or video doesn’t capture how consent really works.
“It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to . . . request this type of agreement before or after an encounter,” said Laura Palumbo, communication director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. “Because in reality, one of the most important things for people to know about consent is that if you have any doubts … then the interaction should not move forward with your partner. ”
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth’s Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time, so written or recorded documentation is in no way representative of an entire sexual encounter.
“If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn’t simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that,” she said.
″On the one hand, people know that consent is important, but on the other hand, of course, these types of ways of proving consent are concerning,” said Zoë Peterson, director of the Sexual Assault Research Initiative at Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute, who studies sexual consent, sexual assault, sexual coercion and unwanted sex.
Gemar said she uses the “FRIES” model to outline the requirements of consent: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, specific.
“A good consensual act or series of events should be active communication the whole time and checking in with their partner,” she said. “They should consent and enthusiastically agree the whole time. ”
The Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio has a 24/7 hotline for victims of sexual assault at 614-267-7020. Ohio State students, faculty and staff can call 614-688-2518 for on-campus support. More information is available at ohiohealth. com/sarnco.

Potential China sales ban could be felt in Lafayette

Texto completo: LAFAYETTE – President Donald Trump's administration is considering placing a ban on General Electric jet engine sales to China, a move that could potentially impact part of a local manufacturing plant that produces parts of the engines in Lafayette.
The administration may decline to issue a license allowing CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran SA, to export more of its LEAP 1C jet engines to China, according to the Wall Street Journal. The engines are being used to develop China's Comac C919 jetliner, a narrow-body twinjet airliner that first flew in 2017 and is part of China's effort to build its jetliner industry.
The LEAP 1C engine is the sole engine designed for use with the Comac C919 and, thus, a Trump administration ban on sales to China could cause an infinite delay in production of the C919.
The C919 is scheduled to go into passenger service in 2021.
The New York Times is reporting that officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere fear China may eventually be able to reverse engineer GE's technology, which could give the country an economic and security edge over the U.S.
The 225,000-square-foot facility in Lafayette opened in 2014. Scott Walker, president and CEO of Greater Lafayette Commerce, said the plant has always had a goal of employing 300 people.
The Lafayette facility mainly produces parts for the LEAP 1A and LEAP 1B, which would not be impacted by the potential Trump administration ban, which focuses only on the LEAP 1C engine.
"GE has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades. We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests," according to GE spokesperson Perry Bradley, who provided a statement to the Journal & Courier after the story was first published.
The LEAP engine is half assembled at GE's facilities in Lafayette and in Durham, North Carolina. Safran's plant in Villaroche, France, assembles the balance.
The Hill reported the administration is expected to discuss a possible ban on sales of the 1C engine to China during an interagency meeting Thursday, revolving around how to reduce the number of exports of U.S. technology to China, and again during a cabinet meeting Feb. 28.
Walker said he suspected that a percentage of sales of the LEAP engines made in the Lafayette plant were sold to China, but the Trump administration considering a ban on the sales would not likely cause great harm to the local economy.
The current Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Tippecanoe County, Walker said, was around $2.4billion in 2018. Before the GE plant opened in 2014, the GDP was close to around $2billion.
Lafayette is home to a large manufacturing economy, including GE Aviation, Subaru Automotive and Caterpillar.
"So, while a portion of our economy is due to GE, it's not a majority," Walker said. "Overall, the benefit our economy has is the diverse manufacturers operating in different industries, so we can weather different storms or cycles that come along."

Texto completo: A best-selling author from Brighton Township has been writing a series of murder mysteries with historical twists.
Colleen Gleason, who has been penning novels and short stories as a full-time career since 2007, recently celebrated the January release of Murder at the Capitol, the third installment of her historical fiction series Lincoln's White House Mysteries (Kensington Publishing Corporation). She wrote the series under the name C.M. Gleason.
"It's an ongoing murder mystery series," Gleason said. "Each book is steeped in historical facts, but I build in a fictional murder mystery."
Her Lincoln's White House Mysteries series began with her 2017 novel, Murder in the Lincoln White House. In the novel, a fictional murder occurs during Lincoln's inaugural ball.
The series continued with her 2018 novel, Murder in the Oval Library. In the novel, the president and others are garrisoned in the East Room at the White House awaiting a Confederate Army attack on Washington, D.C. following the start of the Civil War. Instead of surviving a rebel attack, they must solve a murder following the discovery of a guard murdered inside the White House.
"In the new book, it is right before the Battle of Bull Run, and at the time they were putting a new dome on the Capitol building," Gleason said of her latest book. "It was open to the sky and they have a crane coming out in the rotunda. After a huge Independence Day celebration, it's July 5, and Congress is reconvening. They find a man hanging from the large crane in the dome."
While the murder mysteries are fictional, she said, she aims for accuracy when it comes to establishing a Lincoln-era setting and tackling issues of the time, including slavery and challenges freed black people faced.
Two bookshelves in her writing office are filled with books on the Civil War.
"I did a lot of research, and I continue to research as the books go on," she said. "I also have newspapers.com, so I can look at exactly what was happening on those days and how it was being reported in the news."
'10 things you don't know...' Gleason will do a book signing at 6:30 p.m. today at 2 Dandelions Bookshop, 209 West Main Street, Suite #105.
The shop carries her Lincoln murder mystery series, as well as her other novels.
During the book signing, she will give a presentation on "10 Things You Don't About Civil War Washington," based on things she learned during her research.
Gleason has made prestigious best seller lists.
Her 2015 adventure novel, Siberian Treasure, made it on USA Today's best sellers list.
She is a New York Times best selling author for her contribution to a 2010 anthology of novellas, Bespelling Jane Austen. Her contribution to the four-part anthology, Northhanger Castle, takes an Austen novel and gives it a paranormal slant.
Another recent release, The Zeppelin Deception, the fifth and final installment of her young adult and adult-friendly vampire and mystery series, Stoker & Holmes, was released in August. Those book follow the adventures of Sherlock Holmes's niece and Bram Stoker's sister.
"Those I'm well-known for," Gleason said. "They investigate disappearances of women."
Her novels include murder mysteries, suspense, romance and paranormal adventures.
"My voice as an author is different depending on the book," she said. "Some are sizzley [sic] and spicy, some aren't. The only thing I don't really write is horror, but I do suspense."
2 Dandelions Bookshop co-owner, Jeri Kay Thomas, who is also a kindergarten teacher at Spencer Elementary, said Gleason reached out to her and co-owner Jeanne Blazo as soon as they opened Brighton's only independent bookstore in October.
The store sells books by numerous local authors, including Gleason.
"We made a connection right away with her," Thomas said. "I think it's going to be a long-term collaboration with her."

Texto completo: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. – Mickey Wright was the greatest female golfer.
She had the most perfect golf swing.
She was the most important player on the LPGA tour.
I say all of those things without having her seen her play. I say all of those things because that's what the game's greatest players said about her, legends such as Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Kathy Whitworth.
Golf and the Treasure Coast lost a big piece of history Monday when Mary Kathryn "Mickey" Wright died at 85 after a heart attack. She passed away in Port St. Lucie, where she had lived since 1974.
Mickey and I had a unique relationship. Not only had I never seen her play, I never met her.
I called her in 2003 when I was the golf writer for The Palm Beach Post and, much to my surprise, she answered the phone. I fully expected the call to go to a recording and I would never hear back.
But there was Mickey's voice. We chatted for a while, about Annika Sorenstam's decision to play against the men in the PGA Tour's Colonial tournament, about the sport and about her life. I was talking to a legend like she was a friend.
Mickey ended the conversation with a warning, however: "Craig, I'll talk to you whenever you call, but if you ever try to come see me, I'll never talk to you again."
OK.
I never did try to find where Wright lived, just off the Saints course in Club Med. I wasn't stupid.
As I looked closer at her career and her life, I understood why she required her privacy. When she joined the LPGA tour in 1955, it was barely a blip on anyone's radar.
Few fans cared about women's golf in the 1950s. But Mickey changed that. Her swing was so elegant, her game so tight, her mind so focused.
She was the Tiger Woods of the LPGA tour. Fittingly, both have 82 career titles on their main tour and attended Stanford.
Mickey won 79 of her 82 LPGA titles during a 12-year span from 1957 to 1968, averaging 10 wins a season from 1960 to 1964. She is the only woman to have held the four major titles at one time.
But the pressures to play and win every week forced Mickey to virtually retire at the age of 34. If Mickey didn't play, nobody cared about the tournament.
Sound familiar?
All Mickey wanted to do was hit a golf ball, not stand in front of a microphone or a camera. When I asked her if she ever thought about playing against the men, like Annika was doing, I already knew the answer.
"Golf is show business today," Mickey said. "If you start with that premise and believe in that, then anything goes. It's hard to know how you feel when you're being promoted by the promoters. I'm not into that."
When Mickey played in her last official tournament in 1994, LPGA players flocked to her gallery when their round was over. It was like an opportunity to see the magical Oz. Mickey's last public appearance was in 1996, almost a quarter century before her death.
I knew how fortunate I was to be able to talk to Mickey on the phone. I didn't call her often, maybe two or three times a year, and would always learn something new about her.
Here's one of her best golf tips: Mickey said Billy Casper, who like her grew up in San Diego, told her to practice putting at dusk, when you have to rely more on your feeling than your eyes.
Port St. Lucie was the perfect town for Mickey to spend the back nine of her life. It was quiet and peaceful, with a golf course out her back door.
A ranger at the course once brought her a strip of synthetic turf so Mickey could hit balls without taking more than a few steps.
When my son Eric almost died in 2005 after a bacterial infection, Mickey wrote me a long letter saying how she was praying for Eric. Who writes letters anymore?
Two years later, I received a phone call from Mickey's longtime manager, Peggy Wilson, who gave me some bad news: Mickey had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was having surgery.
"Mickey might be mad at me for doing this, but I know she would want you to know," Wilson said.
I broke the story about Mickey's breast cancer, but there was no celebration for this national scoop.
Mickey recovered from the cancer and continued to play the stock market, do The New York Times crossword puzzle and watch golf on TV.
When she was named the 2010 Bob Jones Award winner, the U.S. Golf Association's highest honor, I asked her if she would do an interview on a radio show I co-hosted.
Mickey hesitated but finally said yes, only because she felt it would be good for the USGA. A few years later, I asked her to do another radio show. She said no.
I never asked again.
It's been more than a year since I heard Mickey's voice, and I'm saddened I'll never hear it again. I don't think it was a coincidence I was covering the PGA Women's Stroke Play Championship in Port St. Lucie on Monday, the day she passed.
She might have been the best female player with the best swing and the pressure of the fledgling tour riding on her. But she was so much more.
She was one of golf's greatest treasures.

Texto completo: NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt will deliver Rutgers University's commencement address in May, the university's board of governors voted on Tuesday.
Holt, known for his trademark on-the-ground reporting style, will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree when he speaks at the 254th anniversary commencement May 17 at SHI Stadium in Piscataway.
Holt said he is "incredibly honored" for the opportunity to speak to students in the Class of 2020.
During his brief break from covering the 2020 election to speak to Rutgers graduates, Holt expects to address online communications in polarizing times and how they impact journalism.
"As so many of us assume the role of 'citizen journalists' via social media, we have to assume the responsibility that comes with it," he said.
Holt has been recognized with numerous honors, including multiple Emmy Awards and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism award. In 2019, he was honored with the prestigious Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.
Hip-hop radio DJ and recording artist Angie Martinez will deliver the keynote address at Rutgers University-Newark's commencement May 20 at Prudential Center, where she'll also receive an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree.
Martinez is a pioneer in popularizing hip-hop music, having earned a Grammy nomination in the genre in 1997 and having established herself as one of its leading on-air radio personalities through her shows on stations Hot 97 and then Power 105.1, as well as iHeartMedia.com.
"... Ms. Martinez knows our students, loves our students, and inspires – and is inspired by – our students. She is an ideal commencement speaker and honorary degree recipient from Rutgers-Newark," Rutgers-Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor said.
New York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, American Bar Association President Judy Martinez, and state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli will receive honorary degrees and speak at Rutgers University-Camden's commencement at the BB&T Pavilion May 20-21.
"Rutgers-Camden is proud to present honorary degrees to three prominent advocates for equality during commencement this year," Rutgers-Camden Chancellor Phoebe A. Haddon said.
Hannah-Jones, an award-winning investigative reporter who covers civil rights and racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine, will receive a Doctor of Letters degree at the College of Arts and Sciences ceremony May 20.
Martinez, president of one of the world's largest voluntary professional organizations, with nearly 400,000 members and more than 3,500 entities, will receive a Doctor of Laws degree at the Rutgers Law School ceremony May 21.
Persichilli, a registered nurse with vast experience leading hospitals across New Jersey who was confirmed as commissioner last month, will receive a Doctor of Science degree at the Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden ceremony May 20.
Sandy J. Stewart, a biotech industry entrepreneur and scientist, as well as a former chair of the Rutgers Board of Trustees and Board of Governors, will receive an honorary Doctor of Human Letters degree at the Piscataway ceremony.

A month out, Ohio's Democratic primary appears muddled

Texto completo: Predicting the story you'll be reading in about one month after Ohio Democrats finally cast their presidential primary ballots is quite likely a fool's errand.
After all, Democrats in about two dozen states – including California and Texas with their huge delegate hauls – will vote before Ohio's St. Patrick's Day primary. And three more debates are scheduled, including one in Phoenix two days before Ohio voters go to the polls. Tuesday was the final day to register to vote in the March 17 primary. Early voting begins today.
So a battlescape that currently shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar surging, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggling and former Vice President Joe Biden fading could look far different in a month – especially once free-spending Michael Bloomberg joins the hunt for votes.
Several of the candidates already have set up shop in Ohio, although no one is coming close to the presence of Bloomberg's operation. President Donald Trump is unopposed for the GOP primary nod.
John Green, veteran director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, sees two possible storylines for the 2020 Buckeye State primary.
"The conventional scenario is that the frontrunner, Sanders, rides momentum to win Nevada and South Carolina, and rivals begin to drop out, such as Biden and Warren. The frontrunner then faces a reduced field on Super Tuesday (March 3), does well, and only one viable rival is left standing by Ohio – probably Buttigieg, but maybe Bloomberg."
But Green says it may not be so simple.
"The alternative scenario is that most candidates stay in – largely because of the combination of multiple candidates and the proportional assignments of delegates. ... The current polls in Nevada suggest that even if Sanders comes in first, others will share in the delegates.
"And if Biden wins in South Carolina, he will stay in through Super Tuesday. Bloomberg may – or may not – score big on Super Tuesday, but either way, multiple candidates come into Ohio."
That means, Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper says, "Our primary will be an important prize."
Who will win?
"Ohio Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump this November while also representing our values and Ohio values. Needless to say, the primary gives each candidate the opportunity to prove that they are that person," said Pepper.
Ohio's March 17 primary ballot includes 11 Democratic presidential candidates, although fewer are still campaigning after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. No candidate filed the appropriate paperwork to remove their name from Ohio's ballot after dropping out.
Bloomberg's Ohio effort is consistent with his national strategy of ignoring early voting states where relatively few delegates are awarded and concentrating on the delegate-rich states in March.
In Ohio, Bloomberg's campaign has 91 paid staff members, including Aaron Pickrell, who ran President Barack Obama's 2008 operation in Ohio. In comparison, Bloomberg's campaign has hired at least 70 paid staff members in Florida, whose primary is the same day as Ohio's, the New York Times reports.
Team Bloomberg has 12 offices around the state, including a headquarters and two satellite offices in Columbus. The campaign has "hundreds of volunteers," and has knocked more than 14,000 doors so far, spokeswoman Meredith Tucker said.
Warren got an early start in Ohio. She hired her first paid staff here in October, and that presence has grown in the ensuing months. Warren's campaign has offices in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and it has more than 20 paid staff members on the ground in Ohio.
Buttigieg's campaign is jumpstarting its Ohio operation this week by hiring a state director.
Buttigieg has 23 volunteer leads and 1,300 Ohioans signed up to volunteer on the campaign. They have organized 150 events in Ohio so far. The campaign put out a plea last week for Ohioans to provide temporary housing for campaign volunteers moving into the state.
Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Green said more-moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.

Biden's campaign hasn't yet hired any paid staff in Ohio, but Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, who worked for Biden in the White House, has been working to drum up support for the former vice president.
Julia Krieger, Biden's regional Super Tuesday communications director, said he "has received dozens of endorsements from elected officials at all levels of government — including former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland — who support Vice President Biden and his vision for our country. This wide breadth of support is also a testament to Biden's electability against Trump but also his strength to deliver wins up and down the ticket in battleground states like Ohio, where he continues to remain strong."
Green said more moderate candidates such as Biden tend to play better in Ohio, but Buttigieg and Klobuchar also will get an extra look because of their Midwestern roots.
C.J. Warnke, Klobuchar's deputy national press secretary, offered on a general description on her Ohio effort: "Thanks to Senator Klobuchar's strong debate performances, tireless campaigning, and field staff dedicated to organizing throughout the state, our team is seeing a major upswing in momentum, including in Ohio, where we plan to continue ramping up operations."
Sanders has an active network of volunteers in Ohio, and one of his leading national spokespersons, Nina Turner, is a former state senator from Cleveland.
Will an early presence in Ohio make a difference in the primary?
"We are strong proponents of candidates' investing to organize in Ohio, and we're grateful to every candidate that is investing and organizing on the ground here," Pepper said. "Certainly that kind of early infrastructure is an important part of doing well here, just as the ultimate nominee building a strong operation in the summer and fall will be key to turning Ohio blue."

Texto completo: America is about to meet Michael Bloomberg, presidential candidate, and the possibilities of what comes after that formal introduction on a debate stage in Las Vegas Wednesday night boggle the mind.
What will the people of Nevada, South Carolina, Kansas and Kentucky think of this prickly but persuasive know-it-all of a New York City Jewish billionaire?
Bloomberg, thanks to a 19% showing in a national poll this week and some fourth-quarter rule changes by a Democratic Party eyeing his billions like jackals spying a pile of ribeyes, is hitting the stage. There he'll serve as a sudden addition to the menu, like a special the waiter never mentioned until it became clear the table wasn't buying the regular dinner options.
Bloomberg's meteoric rise in a race in which many Democrats are desperate for an answer to President Donald Trump is not surprising. Anyone can look good for a moment early in a presidential contest: just ask Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, John Edwards, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum or Howard Dean. 
But can Bloomberg's wave survive people getting a chance to listen to him answer questions, and watching him grimace with the heavy pain of his intellectual superiority while having to answer those pesky questions?  
Great question! No one knows. That's why we play the game. 
Even before he announced his late entry, the clamor of support that should have been Bloomberg's death-knell in the Democratic Party began: the onslaught of right-wing thinkers telling liberals Bloomberg is their best choice. Bloomberg is the kind of Democrat Republicans love, which is to say a self-made billionaire longtime Republican, and New York Times conservapundit Bret Stephens probably shared their feelings best in his November column "Run, Mike, Run!"
The last time I saw the opposite party get this excited about a presidential candidate in the primaries was when Democrats clamored for the dreamily moderate 2012 Republican candidate Jon Huntsman. He dropped out after Republican voters remembered they don't like the candidates that Democrats like and stomped his White House dreams in New Hampshire like an empty pack of Marlboro Reds.
That also might happen with Bloomberg. Practically everybody I know or read who supports him is a Trump-hating moderate or Republican, not a Democrat, and their support is more pragmatic than passionate. But Democrats get to pick their presidential candidate, and disdain among Democrats is why Bloomberg always ran for New York City mayor as a Republican: he feared he could not win a Democratic primary.
It was, and continues to be, a legitimate fear. He is far to the right of many of the voters he'd need to woo to snag the nomination, at least some of whom would not vote for Bloomberg even in a general election against Trump.
I look forward to seeing someone on that stage who is all the things Trump claimed to be and never was: Self-made, a billionaire, smart, well-educated, respected and truly unconcerned with what others think of him. Trump, who has claimed to be above public opinion, is obsessed with it. Bloomberg, with whom I spent a few hours toward the end of his mayoralty, is so supremely self-confident you sense that he has not even considered that he might be wrong for years. He doesn't get angry when you disagree with him, he's just baffled that you could possibly be so misguided.
That was the hubris at the core of his anti-big soda, anti-salt, anti-tobacco nanny-state impulses. Bloomberg knows best and believes we all need to just do as he says. 
I'd have said it would make him too unlikeable to be president, until "too unlikeable to be president" stopped being a thing.

Texto completo: Margaret C. Tellalian Kyrkostas - an anthropologist and curator who won a fight with the museum on Ellis Island to keep photos in an exhibition depicting the Ottoman Turks' Armenian massacre a century ago - has died.
She was 90.
Kyrkostas died Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset; the cause was complications from bladder cancer, according to her granddaughter Samantha Kyrkostas.
The longtime executive director of Queens College's Anthropology Museum of the People of New York, which she founded with the help of Margaret Mead, Kyrkostas made headlines in 1997 when management of the Ellis Island immigration museum told Kyrkostas that more than a dozen photographs of massacre that she had helped choose were too gruesome and inappropriate for children, according to The New York Times; she in turn accused the museum of whitewashing history.
After about a month, Kyrkostas and the museum compromis

Upward Mobility: A Bid to Revise the New York Times's Bad History

Texto completo: "I think the important point to make about slavery is that it had existed for thousands of years without substantial criticism," said the historian Gordon Wood in an interview last year. "But it's the American Revolution that makes it a problem for the world. And the first real anti-slave movement takes place in North America. So this is what's missed by these essays in the 1619 Project."
Mr. Wood is one of the country's leading experts on the colonial era, and he was referring to a collection of New York Times articles published last summer that examine the role of slavery in American history. The project posits that the country's real founding occurred not in 1776 but in 1619, when the first African slaves arrived in Virginia. The claim is that the Revolutionary War was fought primarily to preserve America's "slavocracy," and that the country has risen politically, economically and culturally only through the subjugation of blacks.
Since publication, both the Times and its staff writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project's creator, have come under sharp criticism from prominent academics. Now entering the fray is Robert Woodson, a black conservative and longtime community activist in Washington. Last week Mr. Woodson held a press conference to announce his own "1776 Project," which is intended to counter what he called the "anti-America propaganda" of the Times's endeavor. What's troubling about "1619" is that "it defines America as being incurably racist," he said. It insists that "all white people are beneficiaries of privilege and . . . victimizers. And all blacks are victims."
Ms. Hannah-Jones has dismissed her detractors as "old white male historians," but Mr. Woodson doesn't fit that bill. Nor do a good number of the scholars he recruited -- Glenn Loury, Carol Swain, John McWhorter, Jason Hill and Wilfred Reilly -- to write essays that provide an "aspirational and inspirational" counternarrative to the Times's. The pieces will appear on the Washington Examiner's website and at 1776unites.com.
Mr. Loury described the absurdity of demonizing Western civilization for an institution that predates it. "Slavery was a fact of human civilization since antiquity," he said at the press conference. "Abolition is the new idea. And that is a Western idea not possible without the democratic institutions that were built in 1776." And in her essay, Ms. Swain reminds us that no single group is blameless, a fact the "1619 Project" all but ignores. "Those who push white guilt and black victimhood ignore critical facts," she writes. "One is that today's white Americans are not responsible for the sins of generations ago. Second, slavery was an institution that blacks, Native Americans, and whites participated in as slaveholders. There's plenty of guilt to go around there."
Mr. Woodson believes his project will correct a false and fatalistic narrative and provide an optimistic path forward for the black underclass. The Times's "negative message is dangerous to the future because it discourages blacks" from trying, and "nothing is more lethal than a good excuse for failing."
None of this is to play down numerous errors and omissions of the "1619 Project." The essays contend, for example, that slavery produced "dizzying profits" and "helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus." But as the historian Wilfred McClay explained in Commentary magazine in October, scholars have blasted such claims are "demonstrably wrong" and based on "elementary accounting errors, incorrectly double- and triple-counting intermediate transaction costs in a way that greatly inflates the final figure."
And to Ms. Hannah-Jones's assertion that "for the most part, black Americans fought back alone," the historian James McPherson
offered this: "From the Quakers in the 18th century, on through the abolitionists in the antebellum, to the radical Republicans in the Civil War and Reconstruction, to the NAACP which was an interracial organization founded in 1909, down through the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, there have been a lot of whites who have fought against slavery and racial discrimination, and against racism. Almost from the beginning of American history that's been true. And that's what's missing from this perspective."
The "1619 Project" is being adopted as part of the curriculum in thousands of classrooms across the country. The political left is already in the process of turning our K-12 schools into social-justice boot camps, and this will expedite that effort. Properly understood, the "1619 Project" isn't about black history. It's about today's racial disparities. It's about applying current ideologies to past events, in the continuing attempt to blame the past actions of whites for the current problems of blacks. Mr. Woodson understands that this is not only dishonest but damaging. Why doesn't the New York Times?

Texto completo: BEIJING - The largest study of the coronavirus in China so far has concluded that elderly patients and people with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk of dying from COVID-19, as a leading expert predicted that the outbreak was at or near its peak.
Most cases of the disease are mild, while the overall death rate is 2.3%, according the study by China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The research looked at more than 70,000 COVID-19 cases, including confirmed, suspected and asymptomatic cases, as of Feb. 11.
New virus cases in China continued to fall Wednesday, with 1,749 new infections and 136 new deaths announced. The updated figures on the COVID-19 illness for mainland China bring the total for cases to 74,185 and deaths to 2,004. New cases have fallen to under 2,000 daily for the past two days.
A renowned epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, said he expected the outbreak to peak by middle to late February, later than initially estimated, according to Southern Metropolis Daily.
Mr. Zhong said he expected the situation to be "stable" by the end of April.
The World Health Organization (WHO) had said Monday the number of new coronavirus infections in China appeared to be declining, though it was too early to tell if the reported decline would continue.
The CDC study put the overall death rate from the virus at 2.3%, with the age group most at risk being elderly people. The death rate was 14.8% for people above 80 years old, while for those aged 10 to 39, the average death rate was 0.2%.
Data analysis of a subgroup of about 20,000 people showed that patients without any prior medical conditions had a 0.9% fatality rate.
The majority of the cases - 80.9% - showed mild symptoms, while 13.8% of the cases were severe and 4.7% were critical, according to the study.
State media reported Tuesday that a hospital director in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, died from the disease.
Liu Zhiming, director of Wuchang Hospital, died from the disease on Tuesday morning, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The state-run newswire China News Service previously reported he had died on Monday, but the announcement was later deleted from the microblogging site Weibo.
Cities continued to tighten their restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus.
Beijing on Monday cordoned off its hutongs, traditional alleyways in the center of the city, with community members restricting nonresidents' access.
The Beijing International Automobile Exhibition, which was supposed to take place from April 21 to 30, has been postponed due to the outbreak, the organizers said.
Meanwhile, the number of people who have tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan has risen by 88 to 542 cases.
Sixty-five of the confirmed cases do not show any symptoms, the Japanese Health Ministry said. All those infected have been taken to local hospitals, local media reported.
Israel's health minister said a dozen Israelis on board the Diamond Princess will be flown to Israel on Thursday. Three Israelis have been infected and are hospitalized in Japan.
One Italian national is among those on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who have tested positive for the new coronavirus, Italy's civil protection agency said in a statement.
In Geneva, the WHO said that China's strict measures had delayed the spread of the virus by two to three days in the country, and by two to three weeks abroad, citing calculations by its experts.
"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the right one," WHO emergency operations chief Mike Ryan told reporters.
Mr. Ryan had less positive things to say about Japan's handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus has spread onboard. It will be important to learn the lessons from this case, he said.

THE KEY TO VICTORY TO BEAT TRUMP, FOCUS ON HIS BAD BEHAVIOR

Texto completo: For the past few years, I've been visiting schools and colleges to discuss how they should address Donald Trump in their classrooms. My message is simple: Everyone should be free to like Mr. Trump, but nobody should be allowed to act like Mr. Trump. His personal behavior violates all the norms that we try to teach our children: kindness, compassion and respect.
I've never heard a real objection to that. Some teachers tell me they plan to vote for Mr. Trump, despite his poor behavior. But I haven't met a single one who says it would be OK for students to behave like him.
That's why Democrats should keep harping on Mr. Trump's personal behavior in the campaign to unseat him. His behavior is simply indefensible, and even his defenders know it.
We're a diverse country, in every way, and we disagree about Mr. Trump's positions on the economy, the environment, health care and everything else. Nor is there any real consensus about his efforts to press Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, as the recent impeachment debacle demonstrated.
But we do agree about Mr. Trump's behavior, which is crude, indecent and entirely inappropriate for a president. It's just that some people - OK, many people - are willing to put that aside because they approve of his politics.
That's surely the case for evangelical Christians, who generally don't like men who consort with porn stars or boast about grabbing women by the genitals. But they do like Mr. Trump's court appointments, so they keep mum about his behavior or even suggest that he's like King Cyrus in the Bible: a sinful pagan sent by God to redeem us.
Roughly a third of the electorate are so-called "Fifth Avenue Republicans" - that is, people who would vote for Mr. Trump even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, as he claimed during his last campaign. There's a slightly greater number of Fifth Avenue Democrats, who probably wouldn't vote for him even if he promised them an apartment there.
But about 15% of voters remain undecided, and they'll decide the election. Actually, thanks to the Electoral College, about 300,000 voters in five or six states will decide it. And the real question, for Democrats, is how to persuade them.
I don't think the answer lies in a new tax code, or a new free-trade agreement, or even in a new health care system. Nearly two-thirds of Americans approve of the way Mr. Trump has handled the economy, and that's not likely to change anytime soon.
But just under half of surveyed citizens approve of Mr. Trump as a president, which suggests that plenty of Americans think there is something deeply wrong with the way he behaves.
They're right.
He has called American intelligence agencies "Nazis," The New York Times "the enemy of the people," Mexican immigrants "rapists," and African nations "s---hole countries."
He has likened women to dogs and pigs. At a campaign speech, he mocked a disabled reporter by waving around his arms; at another, he called on listeners to "knock the crap" out of protesters and promised to pay any resulting legal bills.
He repeatedly denigrated war hero John McCain, even after McCain died. And he insulted a Gold Star family whose son was killed in Iraq.
We could go on and on and on. And we should. When I tune into Fox News and other GOP-favoring media, I often hear that Democrats are attacking Mr. Trump because they don't have anything else to run on. I don't think that's exactly right, but I do think that Mr. Trump's personal behavior provides the best argument against him.
So on the campaign trail, Democrats should ask Americans two simple questions: How many of you would want your kids to act like Donald Trump? And if you wouldn't, why would you vote for him for president?
That won't persuade the Fifth Avenue Republicans, of course, but it will turn enough undecided voters against Mr. Trump to turn him out of office.
Memo to Democrats: It's not the economy, stupid, and it's definitely not Ukraine. It's Donald Trump.

CAN THE UNITED STATES BE SAVED? THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ASSAULT ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM MAY BE TOO MUCH TO BEAR

Texto completo: I need to tell you the context of my next comment in advance of making it. Altogether, I have lived and worked in 10 countries beyond the United States, and visited many more. Quite a few of them would fall in the category of so-called "failed states," including Libya, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lebanon, the Central African Republic, Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
My analysis of them, assessing their functionality and their prospects for economic development, was that the most essential element of their governments and societies was a functioning judiciary. With one, not only would human rights be respected to some extent, but the overall rule of law would have a reasonable prospect of being respected. With these protections, domestic and international business could be conducted, and prosperity, or at least a standard of living concomitant to the country's resources, could be achieved.
Without a functioning judiciary and the rule of law, an unjust society and a shady business climate could more easily take hold, motivating people to stay away. If one is a national, expatriate one's funds; if one is a potential foreign investor, look elsewhere.
Against that context, President Donald Trump's dive last week into the functioning of the American justice system to try to get a lighter sentence for his longtime associate and friend Roger Stone may have been the worst thing he has done yet. In doing so. he has taken a hatchet to our system of government. If one cannot expect the courts to operate free of politicization, where are we?
And if Attorney General William Barr, instead of standing up for the integrity of the Department of Justice he heads, acts like Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy or the dog on the old Victor records, "His Master's Voice," we are in real trouble.
The only conceivable motivations behind Mr. Barr's actions are his career or money. Yet his actions may have imperiled his access to them both. He is in the process of receiving his just deserts in the form of some 2,000 former prosecutors and other Justice Department officials calling for his resignation. And it is hard to imagine that Mr. Barr's future employment prospects, even with a Republican law firm, have not been severely damaged by the letter and his performance as head of the Justice Department.
But America is the big loser here. I don't know what happens next. Judge Amy Berman Jackson could disregard the tweets from the White House and the "guidance" from Mr. Barr, and nonetheless give Mr. Stone seven-to-nine years in the slammer. Or she could let him walk, and she may receive an eventual Supreme Court appointment from a shameless president and Senate. We will see.
Mr. Trump's first term has done damage to the republic far beyond whatever change was justified by the mustiness of American institutions. A second term would clearly give him a chance to do much more structural damage to our country, including a continued assault on the justice system.
But preventing a second Trump term would require the Democratic Party to put up a credible candidate, capable of taking on the president. I am trying desperately to find one of them even vaguely inspiring.
America, which is beginning to resemble some rickety boat headed for Niagara Falls, is unfortunately not alone. There are danger signs appearing throughout many nations around the world.
Germany, the economic and hitherto political bellwether of Europe, is struggling to find a credible successor for Chancellor Angela Merkel. This comes as the country's far-right party, Alternative for Germany, is gaining traction.
In China, meanwhile, the outbreak of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus has impacted the nation's economy, which could have significant reverberations throughout global markets.
Even Western Pennsylvania presents problems. Is fracking good for us because natural gas pollutes less than coal, or do we need to be concerned that its effect on our water supply will require us eventually to shower with bottled water?
America's role in addressing these issues will start with the president, so an inspiring Democratic candidate is a must. Will it be Amy Klobuchar? Bernie Sanders? Mike Bloomberg? Pete Buttigieg? And can any of them beat Mr. Trump? Let us pray.

Texto completo: New episodes of "The Chef Show" hit Netflix. And a Victorian comedy series debuts on IFC.
What's Streaming
THE CHEF SHOW Stream on Netflix. It's easy to see why Jon Favreau and Roy Choi signed on to host this food travel show. One of the new episodes finds them chomping down smoked fish at Wexler's Deli in Southern California. ("It looks so good," Choi marvels.) Another begins with footage of the two sampling red wine given to them by Wolfgang Puck. (Favreau's conclusion: "It's good.") Other highlights from the latest batch of episodes, released Wednesday, include the pair getting a lesson in cooking Peruvian ceviche from the chefs and restaurateurs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken, and cooking bread and biscuits with the filmmaker Sam Raimi. Raimi seems mildly envious of the pair's gig: "Boy," he says while holding a steaming bowl of delicious-looking food, "this is one of the toughest shoots I've been on."
JUSTIN BIEBER: SEASONS Stream on YouTube. Last week, Justin Bieber released "Changes," his first album in a half-decade, in which he attempts to reimagine himself by fully embracing R&B. Accompanying the new album is "Seasons," a YouTube series that chronicles his return, his music-making process and his struggles with stardom, which include several years of drug abuse. "The first few episodes of 'Seasons' are about, loosely, how the sausage gets made," Jon Caramanica wrote in a recent article in The New York Times. "But the subsequent ones are something else altogether -- a picture of how the sausage almost doesn't get made."
What's on TV
YEAR OF THE RABBIT 10:30 p.m. on IFC. The writer-performer Matt Berry is known overseas for playing a sleazy corporate executive and failed actor in the British sitcoms "The IT Crowd" and "Toast of London," but domestic audiences are probably most likely to recognize him as one of the vampire roommates in the ongoing "What We Do in the Shadows" TV series. Berry dons a figurative detective's cap and literal mutton chops in this Victorian spoof, in which he plays a foul-mouthed inspector in 19th-century London. The story sees his character attempting to solve crime alongside two partners, one of them very inexperienced (played by Freddie Fox) and another far more adept than him (Susan Wokoma).
NATURE: THE MIGHTY WEASEL 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). An orchestral arrangement of "Pop Goes the Weasel" opens this latest entry in PBS's "Nature" documentary series. The program strikes a playful tone as it educates viewers about the minutiae of weasel life, and the lives of some related mammals. Ana Gasteyer, the actress and former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, narrates.
BLACK PATRIOTS: HEROES OF THE REVOLUTION 10 p.m. on History. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hosts this hourlong documentary, which centers on the experiences of African-Americans during the Revolutionary War. The figures it looks at include the poet Phillis Wheatley, the soldier Peter Salem and Crispus Attucks, whose death during the Boston Massacre helped spark the revolution.

A Barbuto Reboot In the West Village

Texto completo: Less than a year after the original closed, Jonathan Waxman is reopening in a space nearby, with much of the old menu.
It looked like the typical New York restaurant -- that is, real estate -- story. In May, the chef Jonathan Waxman's restaurant Barbuto closed after nearly 16 years as a treasured fixture of the West Village. The quirky building had been sold, and the landlord wanted the space for a different use.
But on Feb. 25, less than a year later, it is set to reopen not far from the original. "We're 300 steps away," Mr. Waxman said. "I couldn't be happier."
Barbuto, Italian for bearded and a reference to Mr. Waxman's own facial hair, was a neighborhood hangout that drew an artsy celebrity crowd thanks in large part to the chef's marquee prestige, and his cooking, which filtered Italy through a California lens.
"Barbuto worked because the food was as great as the restaurant's owner," said Keith McNally, the owner of several restaurants including Pastis, a block north of Barbuto, and itself a re-creation of an earlier restaurant. "The hardest thing popular restaurants face when they're built a second time is their former popularity. I believe Pastis has succeeded so far because I wanted to make it similar, but not identical, to the original Pastis."
Barbuto's former spot on Washington Street, a no-frills industrial space, had an open kitchen fueled with roaring fires, furnished with bare tables and, along one side, garage doors that opened to the street in good weather. That Mr. Waxman could find a new space that is fairly similar and close by, on Horatio Street, is surprising.
Whether the new Barbuto will repeat the success of the old remains to be seen. Mr. Waxman's attempt to recreate Jams, his dazzling first New York restaurant -- a collaboration with Melvyn Master from 1984 to 1989 on the Upper East Side -- has not gone so well. The new Jams opened in a hotel on 58th Street and Avenue of the Americas in 2015; a review by the New York Times critic Pete Wells gave it no stars and called it a "zombie Jams" -- "stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre." (The building that housed the original Jams is now to be renovated.)
Other reboots of beloved restaurants, like the Four Seasons, have failed. Then again, there are plenty of recent examples of successful transplants: Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, Hakan Swahn's Aquavit, Jean Denoyer's La Goulue and, in Los Angeles, Wolfgang Puck's Spago. But none of these were able to turn around at the warp speed of Barbuto.
The new space is larger than the old, permitting a longer stretch of bar, though for now, the number of seats, 74, remains the same. The open kitchen with an impressive pizza oven and space for tables has been replicated. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap two sides of the room overlooking West Street and the Hudson River. There are no garage doors to roll open, but there is an outdoor terrace.
The menu is essentially a reprise, anchored by dishes like chicken dappled with a green sauce; a salad with anchovies tucked in its shadows; gnocchi à la minute and other al dente pastas. Mr. Waxman will add soups, and more desserts, as Heather Miller, the pastry chef at Jams, is moving to Barbuto.
"There's no point in making big changes now," Mr. Waxman said. "I've been at this since 1972."
All but one of his employees have remained, he said. "Having these people here gives me a lot of confidence. They're my security blanket."

New Scandal For Russia: Insider Deals

Texto completo: A forensic audit of Russia's antidoping agency has suggested former officials funneled money to companies they controlled.
A forensic audit of Russia's scandal-plagued antidoping agency appears to have unearthed a new problem: hundreds of thousands of dollars, and perhaps more, paid to companies linked to former senior executives at the agency.
The spending, documented by the international financial consultants Baker Tilly in a report commissioned by the antidoping agency's director general, was for drug-testing equipment and other goods and services. According to a summary of the 54-page report viewed by The New York Times, the agency, known as Rusada, sometimes paid as much as 50 percent more than market rates for the purchases.
"Purchases were not made through competitive procedures, but by the decision of key managers in the organization," according to the report, which named a former head of the agency as one of the officials involved.
The accusation of self-dealing by former Rusada executives is just the latest scandal involving the agency, which in recent years has been accused of manipulating or covering up failed drug tests by Russian athletes and then working to sabotage an investigation into its conduct by global antidoping regulators.
The audit of Rusada's finances was commissioned by the current director general of the agency, Yuri Ganus. Ganus, a former railway executive, had no prior experience in sports administration before taking the post in 2017, but he had experience with troubleshooting organizations in crisis.
One of the first tasks he undertook, he said, was to look through Rusada's finances. When costs for equipment and other expenses seemed to be far higher than he expected, he hired Baker Tilly to look through all of Rusada's accounts.
"I saw the papers," Ganus said in a telephone interview. "I saw big differences between what was proposed and the prices they received."
Ganus said he had expected official action to be taken after the report's findings were supplied to the Russian authorities. An investigation was opened and officials were interviewed, he said, but then the case was suddenly closed.
Believing his agency has been the victim of fraud, Ganus said, he has written to the public prosecutor's office in Moscow to demand that it reopen the investigation.
"I believe in this report," Ganus said. "When the investigation committee stopped the investigation, I disagreed with it."
Details of the financial dealings at Rusada are merely the latest concern for the agency, and for the credibility of Russian sports.
Late last year, the World Antidoping Agency banned Russia from international sports for four years -- including this summer's Olympics in Tokyo -- after finding that key laboratory data related to an earlier doping scandal had been manipulated. Russia has appealed its ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is expected to hear the case at the end of April or in early May.
The Baker Tilly analysis identified several companies that appeared to have only one customer, Rusada, and others in which a number of what it described as "former top managers" of the antidoping agency were investors or co-owners. The report also found examples of transactions with so-called "one-day" companies, which are operational for a short period of time, or for just a tiny number of transactions, before disappearing.
"We ask to pay attention to these purchases as a possible case of financial abuse by the key management of the organization," the Baker Tilly report said. It warned that significant sums of money were spent on suppliers with "potentially high levels of risk and affiliation."
Among the officials involved in the companies, the report said, was Ramil Khabriev, who resigned as the head of Rusada in December 2015. His departure came after WADA, the global doping regulator, suspended the agency for what it said was an industrial-scale doping operation involving Russian athletes.
Rusada's suspension was lifted in September 2018, when Russia promised to hand over details of laboratory data that would allow sports organizations to finally determine the identities of athletes who had doped. The resumption of Rusada's activities proved to be short-lived, however; last year, WADA determined the laboratory data supplied by Russia had been purposely altered or deleted.
Rusada was suspended again in December as part of the wider ban imposed on Russian sports.

To the Editor:
Re "In Bloomberg, Liberals See a Wallet Too Big to Offend" (front page, Feb. 16):
I remember the accusations circulating when John F. Kennedy ran for president that his father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., one of the richest men in America at the time, was going to buy the election for his son. Kennedy embodied the notion that a person of great wealth could still have a social conscience -- and, in fact, precisely because of his financial independence, might be more resistant to nefarious influences. His social conscience (and his choice of Lyndon Johnson as a running mate) led to some of the most important legislative advances of the 20th century in the areas of health care and equal rights.
Thus, I am mystified at your front-page article implying that Michael Bloomberg's support for a remarkable range of liberal causes is largely a sham recently cooked up to get him elected president.
Ironically, Kennedy identified a more likely candidate for concern when he authorized a commission to look at the baleful influence of money on candidates for political office. His prescience about the negative influence of special interests worries me far more than Michael Bloomberg's support for causes I care about.

Texto completo: The president granted full pardons to seven people and commutations to four others on Tuesday. Here's who they are.
President Trump pardoned seven people on Tuesday, including the "junk bond king" Michael R. Milken and Bernard B. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner. He also commuted the sentences of Rod R. Blagojevich, a former governor of Illinois, and three others.
The Constitution gives presidents what the Supreme Court has ruled is the unlimited authority to grant pardons, which excuse or forgive a federal crime. A commutation, by contrast, makes a punishment milder without wiping out the underlying conviction. Both are forms of presidential clemency.
Here are the 11 people who benefited from the executive grants of clemency that Mr. Trump signed Tuesday.
Rod R. Blagojevich
Former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2011 for trying to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Barack Obama vacated after he was elected president. Mr. Blagojevich's expletive-filled remarks about his role in choosing a new senator -- "I'm just not giving it up for nothing" -- were caught on government recordings of his phone calls and became punch lines on late-night television.
In 2010, while Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial, he was a contestant on "The Celebrity Apprentice," a reality series hosted by Mr. Trump. Mr. Blagojevich was fired at the end of the fourth episode of the season.
Edward DeBartolo Jr.
Edward DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion plot by a former governor of Louisiana. Mr. DeBartolo was prosecuted after he agreed to pay $ 400,000 to the former governor, Edwin W. Edwards, to secure a riverboat gambling license for his gambling consortium.
The 49ers won five Super Bowl championships in a 14-year span while Mr. DeBartolo was serving as the team's principal owner. Although Mr. DeBartolo avoided prison time, he was fined $ 1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L.
Ariel Friedler
Ariel Friedler, a technology entrepreneur, pleaded guilty in 2014 to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served two months in prison, according to a statement from the White House.
Mr. Friedler has since dedicated his life to promoting veterans issues and helping former prisoners re-enter society, the statement said.
Tynice Nichole Hall
Tynice Nichole Hall was sentenced in 2006 after she was convicted on various drug charges in Lubbock, Texas, according to the Justice Department. The evidence at trial showed that Ms. Hall's residence was used as a stash house for drugs by her boyfriend, who was the main target of an investigation, according to court documents. The police found large quantities of crack and powder cocaine and loaded firearms in her apartment.
Ms. Hall has spent the last 14 years in prison, where she has participated in apprenticeships, completed coursework toward a college degree and led educational programs for other inmates, the White House statement said.
Bernard B. Kerik
Ten years ago this month, Bernard B. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to eight felony charges, including tax fraud and lying to White House officials. Mr. Kerik, who was a close ally of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, took responsibility for his actions.
Mr. Kerik's rise to prominence dates to the 1993 campaign for mayor in New York City, when he served as Mr. Giuliani's bodyguard and chauffeur. After the pardon was announced, Mr. Kerik expressed his gratitude to Mr. Trump on Twitter. "With the exception of the birth of my children," he wrote, "today is one of the greatest days of my life."
Michael R. Milken
Michael R. Milken was the billionaire "junk bond king" and a well-known financier on Wall Street in the 1980s. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, though his sentence was later reduced to two years. He also agreed to pay $ 600 million in fines and penalties. Mr. Milken was the inspiration for the Gordon Gekko character in the film "Wall Street."
Among those arguing for Mr. Milken to be pardoned were Mr. Giuliani, who prosecuted Mr. Milken when he was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Since he was released from prison in 1993, Mr. Milken has striven to repair his reputation by creating the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan economic and public policy think tank.
Crystal Munoz
Crystal Munoz was found guilty in 2008 of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, according to a petition filed by the Criminal Defense Clinic at the Texas A&M University School of Law. Ms. Munoz, who was sentenced to nearly two decades in prison, drew a map that her friends used in a large marijuana trafficking operation, according to Rolling Stone.
Over the past 12 years, Ms. Munoz has mentored people and volunteered with a hospice program while serving in prison, according to the White House statement.
Judith Negron
Judith Negron was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2011 for her role in orchestrating a $ 205 million Medicare fraud scheme as the owner of a mental health care company in Miami. Ms. Negron has served eight years in prison, and her prison warden described her as a "model inmate," according to the White House statement.
Paul Pogue
In 2010, Paul Pogue, the founder and former chief executive of a large construction company in Texas, was sentenced to three years of probation and was ordered to pay $ 723,0000 in fines and restitution for filing false income tax statements, according to the McKinney Courier Gazette.
The White House applauded his charitable work in its statement on Tuesday. "Despite his conviction, Mr. Pogue never stopped his charitable work," the statement said.
David Safavian
David Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, was sentenced to a year in prison in 2009 for covering up his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Mr. Safavian, a former chief of staff at the General Services Administration, was convicted of obstruction of justice and making false statements.
"Having served time in prison and completed the process of rejoining society with a felony conviction, Mr. Safavian is uniquely positioned to identify problems with the criminal justice system and work to fix them," the White House said in the statement.
Angela Stanton
Angela Stanton, an author, television personality and motivational speaker, served six months of home confinement in 2007 for her role in a stolen-vehicle ring. Her book "Life of a Real Housewife" explores her difficult upbringing and her encounters with reality TV stars.
Recently she has begun giving interviews about her support for Mr. Trump. The White House credited her in its statement with working "tirelessly to improve re-entry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release from prison."

Preventing Gun Violence
To the Editor:
Re "The Parkland Massacre Isn't an 'Anniversary"' (Op-Ed, Feb. 14):
Gregory Gibson is so right that we dance around America's gun-violence problem with inappropriate language. We hide from the reality that it could affect us.
I know it well. That's what I did before my son was shot and killed. I thought that it was a problem affecting only other people.
In the coming decade, as in the previous one, more than a million Americans will be shot and about 30 percent of those who are shot will die. No wonder that, as Mr. Gibson says, our word choices allow us to pretend that gun violence will not affect us.
He suggests that we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. More than 90 percent of Americans agree.
We should require there to be a serial number on every gun made and on every gun that is sold, and we should require background checks on every gun sale or transfer.
Too many Republicans, despite what they sometimes say, disagree. The gun lobby wants to sell guns to everyone -- criminals and gun traffickers included.

Texto completo: Her signature performances included the title role in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" and Maria Callas in "Master Class."
Zoe Caldwell, who won Tony Awards -- four in all -- in the 1960s, '80s and '90s, the last for portraying the opera star Maria Callas in "Master Class," Terrence McNally's study of the twilight of the singer's career, died on Sunday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., in Westchester County. She was 86.
Her son Charlie Whitehead said through a spokeswoman that the cause was Parkinson's disease.
Ms. Caldwell, born in Australia, began her acting career in that country; joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in England in 1959; and then, after a stop at the Stratford Festival in Ontario, was part of the inaugural season of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 1963.
In 1966 she was in a bill of two short Tennessee Williams plays on Broadway, combined under the title "Slapstick Tragedy." The run lasted only seven performances, but she made an impression: She won a Tony Award for best featured actress in a play.
A more enduring performance came two years later when she starred on Broadway in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," Jay Allen's play based on a Muriel Sparks novel about an imperious teacher in the 1930s.
"Miss Caldwell flounces onto the stage like a sparrow with illusions of grandeur," Clive Barnes wrote in his review in The New York Times. "She is surrounded with an air of ineffable confidence, and her lilting Scots accent picks over her consonants with the languid deliberation of a dowager picking over a box of candy."
The performance won her the Tony for best actress in a play. She won the same award in 1982 for her portrayal of the title character in "Medea," directed by her husband, Robert Whitehead, whom she had married in 1968, when he was the producer of "Miss Jean Brodie."
Ms. Caldwell's screen credits included "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close" in 2011, but she worked only occasionally in television and films. That was by choice.
"The business of acting is sharing an experience," she told The Boston Globe in 1986.
"Television and movies tend to cut off the element of sharing," she continued. "Images flicker across the screen. Everything is mechanical. Everything is dead. Actors on the stage are alive. The audience is alive."
Limiting her exposure on the large and small screens, she said, helped her be a better actress, because it let her immerse herself in the world.
"Acting is reflecting on the observations of life," she told The Globe. "I'm not a television face. I'm not known. I can walk around the streets of New York, ride the buses, observe life in action. I like to absorb everything I see."
Zoe (pronounced "zo") Ada Caldwell was born on Sept. 14, 1933, in Melbourne. Her father, Edgar, was a plumber, and her mother, Zoe (Hivon) Caldwell, was a taxi dancer, someone from whom dance-hall customers could buy a dance. But at the time, in the midst of the Great Depression, her father was out of work, and with an older child already in the house, the pregnancy had come at a difficult moment.
"Mum's friends told her that she had no choice but to use the coat hanger," Ms. Caldwell wrote in "I Will Be Cleopatra: An Actress's Journey" (2001), "but Mum thought it might be fun to have me around, whoever I was, so she put her coat on the hanger and I was born."
By age 9 she was acting in a production of "Peter Pan." By the mid-1950s she was performing with Melbourne's Union Theater Repertory Company. A particularly famous character to emerge from that time is one she didn't play.
She was in a touring production of "Twelfth Night" with, among others, a student actor named Barry Humphries. At each town the troupe would be greeted by the chairwoman of the local arts council or some similar matron, and on the bus rides from one place to another Mr. Humphries began improvising what he thought the woman in the next town would say, using a character he called Edna. A director suggested he create a sketch for that character, whose name became Dame Edna Everage. Mr. Humphries's idea was for Ms. Caldwell to play the role.
"I read it and I said, 'No, I wouldn't be interested in doing that; I wouldn't know how to make that funny,"' Ms. Caldwell said in an interview with the CUNY-TV series "Women in Theater" in 2006. "'You should do it.' And he did."
Other tellings of the origin of the character differ in some details, but one thing is undeniable: Mr. Humphries went on to make a career of playing Dame Edna.

Ms. Caldwell often said that she didn't like to remain with one acting company long; changing companies, she said, kept her from growing too comfortable and forced her to "see again."
After arriving at the Guthrie, she drew critical praise for her roles opposite Hume Cronyn in "The Miser" in 1963 and opposite Jessica Tandy, Mr. Cronyn's wife, in "The Way of the World" in 1965. The couple, she said, introduced her to Mr. Whitehead, a recent widower.
In addition to working with her on "Miss Jean Brodie," Mr. Whitehead produced or directed other shows in which she appeared, including the 1986 Broadway production of "Lillian," about Lillian Hellman, which he directed.
In 1995 he was a producer of "Master Class," in which Ms. Caldwell gave, Vincent Canby wrote in The Times, "what could be one of the funniest, most moving and gaudiest performances of this season and, perhaps, of her career."
Mr. Whitehead died in 2002. In addition to her son Charlie, Ms. Caldwell's survivors include another son, Sam Whitehead, and two grandchildren.
"Master Class" opens with the Callas character hectoring the audience, saying it's not her fault if she can't be heard, complaining that the theater is too hot and the lights are too bright. For one Wednesday night audience in February 1996, it took a moment to realize that the rant had gone off the rails and that Ms. Caldwell was in fact disoriented. She collapsed and was brought to a hospital. She later attributed the scare to oysters she had eaten after that day's matinee.
"Anything can happen in the theater," she told The Times. "That's why it's so dangerous. I always have had oysters between matinees and the evening performance -- high protein and quick energy. But I've gotten sick two times before, so now it's over."

Texto completo: Calvin Royal III, from American Ballet Theater, will be the artist in residence. He'll perform a premiere by Tiler Peck of New York City Ballet.
Calvin Royal III, the American Ballet Theater soloist who has had star turns in classics like Balanchine's "Apollo," will be the artist in residence at this year's Vail Dance Festival, which was announced on Tuesday.
"It's a leadership role of a sort," Damian Woetzel, the festival's artistic director, said in an interview. "Being an artist in residence is more than simply what you see on the stage. It's got elements that I'm excited about for Calvin as an artist and as a leader."
This summer, Mr. Royal will dance in a new piece by Tiler Peck, the New York City Ballet principal, set to music by the festival's composer in residence, Caroline Shaw. (The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer will contribute to scores for several works, and for featured musicians including the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the bass-baritone Davóne Tines.) Mr. Royal will also conduct master classes and participate in community events.
After Mr. Royal's debut in "Apollo" during Ballet Theater's season last fall, the critic Gia Kourlas wrote in The New York Times that he was "suddenly the most elegant male dancer in the company."
For Mr. Woetzel, Mr. Royal's role is the culmination of a process that stretches back to 2015, when he first appeared at the festival. "He's built so many muscles as a dancer," Mr. Woetzel said, "but also as an artistic human presence in those years."
Ms. Peck's premiere is one of nine commissions -- by dancers and choreographers including Michelle Dorrance, Justin Peck, Raja Feather Kelly, James Whiteside and Lauren Lovette -- to be presented during the festival.
"They all have a 'next step' quality," Mr. Woetzel said, describing these dance-makers. "For every single person on the list there's something that they've been hoping to try to do."
At Vail, he said, they'll have the opportunity to experiment. The festival, which will run July 31 through Aug. 11, is designed to be somewhat open-ended.
"We're always leaving room for what we can do there on site that we really can't do anywhere else," Mr. Woetzel said. "It's a form of chaotic creativity, but it's also a type of alchemy."

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders's campaign said it would request the more intensive step of a recount after the state party announced that it had changed results in 29 precincts but that no national delegates would be moved.
The Iowa Democratic Party announced on Tuesday that it had completed its partial recanvass, changing results in 29 precincts but shifting no national delegates.
But the Epic of Iowa still isn't over.
The recanvass drastically narrowed Pete Buttigieg's small lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in state delegate equivalents: Mr. Buttigieg now has 563.207 to Mr. Sanders's 563.127. The campaigns can now request a recount, which is a much more intensive process. And Mr. Sanders's campaign said it would do just that.
"The recanvass process reduced the state delegate equivalent deficit by 97 percent," Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said in a statement. "We now believe a recount will give Sen. Sanders enough state delegate equivalents to put him over the top."
The initial caucus results showed Pete Buttigieg with an extremely narrow lead over Mr. Sanders in the state delegate equivalent count. But campaigns and journalists identified a slew of irregularities and miscalculations, and Mr. Sanders's campaign argued that those mistakes were enough to change the result.
So last week, Mr. Sanders requested a recanvass in specific precincts where his campaign said there were errors. In response, the Buttigieg campaign filed its own request.
Essentially, these were requests for the state party to check the calculations precinct leaders had done to convert each candidate's supporter totals into state delegate equivalents. This process is meant to catch any errors in precinct leaders' math.
But a recanvass can't confirm whether the initial supporter totals the precinct leaders recorded on their worksheets were correct. That's where a recount -- checking the individual preference cards each caucusgoer filled out -- would come in if a candidate requests one.
If the specific errors Mr. Sanders's campaign claimed were all verified, he would net about six state delegate equivalents, moving him into first place. If the errors Mr. Buttigieg's campaign alleged were all verified, Mr. Buttigieg would expand his lead over Mr. Sanders by about 14 state delegate equivalents.
The dispute is over one national delegate out of the nearly 2,000 needed to win the Democratic nomination. The initial results gave Mr. Buttigieg 13 national delegates and Mr. Sanders 12, with an additional delegate to be awarded to the state delegate equivalent winner when that winner is confirmed.

Bloomberg Surges in Polls And Qualifies for Debates

Texto completo: After garnering 19 percent support in a national poll, the billionaire will be on the debate stage, where he is certain to be a target of onstage criticism.
WASHINGTON -- Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has qualified for the next two Democratic debates, including one on Wednesday in Las Vegas. It will be his first appearance onstage alongside his presidential rivals.
A national poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist released on Tuesday showed Mr. Bloomberg with 19 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents -- his best result yet in a debate-qualifying poll, and good enough for second place behind Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who had 31 percent.
Later in the day, a national poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Bloomberg at 14 percent: again behind Mr. Sanders (27 percent), and alongside former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (15 percent) and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (14 percent).
Mr. Bloomberg will face off Wednesday night against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
The debate, which will air at 9 p.m. Eastern time, will be hosted by NBC News, MSNBC, Telemundo and The Nevada Independent.
The polls showed a substantial surge for Mr. Bloomberg, who received only 4 percent support in the last NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in December, and 9 percent in the last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in January.
Mr. Sanders's support has also increased significantly since the last NPR/PBS/Marist poll, which showed him with 22 percent. His numbers did not change in the NBC/Wall Street Journal polls.
Mr. Biden came in third in the new NPR/PBS/Marist poll, with 15 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 12 percent, Ms. Klobuchar at 9 percent and Mr. Buttigieg at 8 percent. The poll surveyed 527 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents by phone Feb. 13-16 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.4 percentage points.
The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 426 Democrats from Feb. 14-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.75 percentage points.
The latest national polling average calculated by The New York Times, which was released late last week, put Mr. Bloomberg at 10 percent, behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.
Mr. Bloomberg formally entered the race in November, nearly a year after most of the other candidates. He failed to make the cut for the past several debates in part because he is not accepting outside contributions for his campaign. But new rules announced by the Democratic National Committee opened the door to his participation, as they enabled candidates to qualify for the Las Vegas debate, as well as the one that will take place on Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C., without meeting a donor threshold.
He is certain to face onstage criticism Wednesday night from his rivals, especially Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the two candidates who are not appearing at private fund-raisers and who have made targeting billionaires central to their campaigns.
Last week in Virginia, Ms. Warren told supporters that Mr. Bloomberg should not be the Democratic Party's nominee because of his past remarks linking the end of redlining, a discriminatory housing practice, to the financial crisis.
Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders previewed their arguments against Mr. Bloomberg in remarks on Tuesday.
"Anybody here with $ 60 billion, you can run for president, and you can buy the airwaves," Mr. Sanders said in a speech in Reno, Nev. "That is called oligarchy, not democracy."
Ms. Warren was more pointed. "It's a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate," she wrote on Twitter. "But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire."
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Bloomberg would take part in the next debate.
"Mike is looking forward to joining the other Democratic candidates onstage and making the case for why he's the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump and unite the country," Mr. Sheekey said. "The opportunity to discuss his workable and achievable plans for the challenges facing this country is an important part of the campaign process."
Also on Tuesday, Monmouth University released a poll of Virginia voters showing Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders tied at 22 percent each and leading the field. With 99 delegates at stake, Virginia is the fourth-largest prize on the Super Tuesday calendar, and Monmouth's is the first poll to have been taken there since the summer. It is one of the first polls of any state in which Mr. Bloomberg has broken 20 percent. (The Virginia poll has no effect on qualifications for the next two debates.)
The other two candidates in the race, the billionaire Tom Steyer and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, appeared unlikely to receive the requisite 10 percent support in four national qualifying polls, or 12 percent in two polls taken in Nevada or South Carolina, before the qualification deadline for Wednesday's debate.
They have another six days to qualify for next week's debate. They can also qualify for that one by earning at least one delegate in Nevada.
Candidates were able to qualify for the Nevada and South Carolina debates by winning at least one delegate in the Iowa or New Hampshire contests; that is the path Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, who have not met either polling threshold, followed to get their invitations to the stage in Las Vegas.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent over $ 300 million on TV advertising nationwide -- more than the rest of the field combined -- and he has seen his standing steadily rise in national polling as voters have been saturated by his campaign commercials.
He decided to skip the first four nominating contests, held in states where campaigns traditionally spend a year organizing supporters, to focus instead on the delegate-rich primaries that take place beginning on Super Tuesday, March 3. His rivals, meanwhile, have been torn between attacking him and battling one another in the early-state contests.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has emerged in recent years as a leading financial benefactor for Democratic candidates and some liberal causes, such as gun control and environmental protection, entered politics as a Republican when he first ran for mayor in 2001. He endorsed President George W. Bush and spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention.
He has backed other Republicans as well, including former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who was ousted by Ms. Warren in 2012, and Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a gun control ally, in 2016.

CITY &amp; STATE; Weinstein lawyer scolded over op-ed; Defense attorney's article directly addressed jurors.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney was lambasted on Tuesday by a prosecutor for writing an op-ed that directly addressed the jury ahead of trial deliberations, which were set to begin that morning.
The piece, penned by attorney Donna Rotunno and published in Newsweek on Sunday, implored the jury "to do what they know is right and was expected of them from the moment they were called upon to serve their civic duty in a court of law."
"The mocking of Mr. Weinstein's walker, the unflattering courtroom-artist sketches of his body, the countless critical op-eds and biased stories, and the convenient timing of the politically-motivated charges in Los Angeles were all designed to pre-determine his guilt," Rotunno wrote.

Six women testified against the movie mogul in Manhattan, where he faces five counts of sexual assault and life in prison if convicted.
Before the trial began, Judge James Burke instructed attorneys not to give media interviews. But Rotunno has already come under fire for doing so; she gave an interview to the New York Times podcast "The Daily" in the middle of the trial, though she initially told Burke she was interviewed before proceedings began and had not spoken to any reporters since the start of the trial.
In that interview, reporter Megan Twohey asked Rotunno whether she had ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno said. "Because I would never put myself in that position."
Rotunno's response drew swift criticism from sexual assault survivors and their advocates, who said the lawyer's statements were tantamount to victim-blaming. Under the hashtag #WhereIPutMyself, survivors of sexual assault began sharing the settings in which they were attacked in direct response to Rotunno's comments.
Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said Rotunno's Newsweek op-ed was "completely, 100% inappropriate behavior. It borders on tampering with the jury."
"There's no way that the sanctity and purity of a jury trial can ever exist and continue if every party is permitted to just go ahead and publicly say something that they would not be able to ... in court," Illuzzi said.
The prosecutor asked Judge Burke to hold Weinstein in custody, asserting he had something to do with the op-ed.
"There is no way that Ms. Rotunno did this without the prompting and encouragement ... of this defendant," Illuzzi said.
Rotunno called the request to remand Weinstein "improper" and said it was "one small piece of a larger media attack on Mr. Weinstein."
Though the specter of the dozens of women who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct loomed over the trial from the start, the producer's jury was chosen specifically for their professed ability to ignore media coverage and decide the case based only on evidence heard in court.
When speaking to Rotunno's co-counsel, Damon Cheronis, Judge Burke said, "You don't think addressing the jury in the first person isn't problematic?"
Rotunno defended the op-ed, saying it was merely a commentary on the failures of the criminal justice system.
Burke emphatically barred either side from talking to reporters until a verdict was reached and cautioned defense attorneys on "the tentacles" of their "public relations juggernaut."

Texto completo: The move is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to counter Beijing's influence and intelligence operations in the United States.
WASHINGTON -- For years they have operated as news organizations in the United States, deploying scores of journalists to cover the major events of the day and to report back to their readers and viewers at home, even if the most important of those was the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
Now, the Trump administration has declared them not practitioners of journalism, but rather operatives of the Chinese state.
The State Department told China on Tuesday that its five foremost news agencies -- Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and The People's Daily -- will officially be treated as foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States. The new action was described on Tuesday afternoon by two senior State Department officials.
The decision -- debated in Washington for years but never carried out, in part because of concerns over restricting the freedom of the press -- comes at a time when the administration has moved aggressively on multiple fronts to fight what officials describe as extensive Chinese influence and intelligence operations in the United States.
In the past month alone, prosecutors have brought cases against Chinese intelligence operations involving scientific research at Harvard and the 2017 hacking of Equifax, one of the United States' largest credit reporting agencies. They also charged Huawei, the telecommunications company, and two of its subsidiaries with federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.
The legal assault on Chinese entities has unfolded even as bilateral tensions have flared over China's handling of the coronavirus epidemic, which prompted the evacuation of American diplomats and other citizens from Wuhan, the city in central China at the source of the outbreak. It is part of a concerted effort to put new pressure on China's government barely a month after President Trump signed a temporary truce in the trade war he started.
Some of China's critics in Washington have long called for action against the country's state media. The senior State Department officials described the new restrictions as part of the Trump administration's strategy to confront great power adversaries. The officials would not discuss whether Russian media working in the United States would face similar designations.
The State Department officials, who briefed reporters only on the condition of anonymity despite requests for public comment, said the new designation would not impede the five Chinese news agencies' ability to report, broadcast or carry out other journalistic activity.
Instead, the officials said, it requires the five organizations to provide names, personal details and turnover of staff in the United States to the State Department. The news organizations would also need to report whether they own or lease property in the United States.
The officials would not comment on how the new registration requirements would be enforced. Nor would they predict what backlash foreign journalists in China might face as a result of the designations.
One State Department official cited an already tough working environment for journalists in China, where he said that "freedom of the press is under a severe siege." He also described the five Chinese news organizations as "part and parcel of the P.R.C. propaganda apparatus," using an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China.
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, echoed a suspicion held in national security circles that the decision could lead to retaliation against American journalists who work in China -- especially those affiliated with the United States government, like Voice of America.
"China has long masked intelligence operations with journalistic credentials," Mr. Turley said. "The danger is China could reciprocate against our journalists."
He added, "The difference is our journalists in China are actually journalists."
The two State Department officials and a third Trump administration official said the restrictions against the Chinese news employees -- similar to those required by diplomats in the Chinese Embassy in Washington or in consulates around the United States -- were extended because they were substantially owned and effectively controlled by China's government.
The American government has already targeted some of the news agencies under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires anyone lobbying on behalf of foreign governments to submit regular reports on their activities to the Justice Department.
Partly in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, the administration has forced parts of China's official propaganda apparatus to register. They included CGTN, the English-language channel of China Central Television, Beijing's main domestic network, which was forced to register beginning last year. One of the others, China Daily, has been registered as a foreign agent since 1983.
The new action treats the news organizations as part of China's diplomatic missions whose activities are regulated under the Foreign Missions Act. Enacted in 1982, the law is a legal tool intended to ensure equitable treatment for American diplomats serving in countries around the world, often under onerous government restrictions. It deals with such things as providing visas, acquiring property and extending diplomatic immunity in matters of criminal wrongdoing.
Last fall, for example, the State Department began requiring Chinese diplomats to give notice before they have any meetings with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions. That move came in retaliation for similar Chinese government rules imposed on American diplomats. But the five Chinese news agencies whose employees are working in the United States will be exempted from that requirement, the State Department officials said.
American officials have become much more suspicious of the activities of Chinese diplomats and have increased scrutiny of their travels and meetings. In September, the State Department secretly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials in Washington after they were caught driving on a sensitive military base in Virginia with their wives. The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of espionage in more than 30 years.
It was not clear why the Trump administration decided to act now on the Chinese news organizations, although the administration official said the move reflected long-simmering frustration over the forbearance shown to Chinese official media in the United States, despite evidence that the organizations serve as a front for intelligence agencies.
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally mandated agency, warned in its report in 2017 that "Chinese intelligence-gathering and information-warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese state-run media organizations."
In recent years, a growing number of American officials have discussed imposing strict visa reciprocity on Chinese news organizations after Beijing increasingly began limiting visas and residence permits issued to foreign journalists and curtailed the lengths of those documents.
Unlike Russia's information campaigns in the United States, which have been artfully tailored to sow distrust in the American government and the democratic system, China's media efforts in the United States have tended to reflect more traditional forms of government propaganda. Reports on CGTN or in China Daily, for example, are more likely to extol the country's economic and diplomatic achievements than to denigrate American democracy.
Xinhua, which is China's main news agency and serves as a channel for most major announcements, maintains bureaus around the world, with its largest in Washington and New York. It is common practice for many of them to produce internal documents, intended for consumption not by the public but by high-ranking officials.
Some disagreed with the action. "I don't see any evidence that they are doing anything nefarious that would warrant this response," said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University and the author of "Media Politics in China: Improvising Power Under Authoritarianism."
China Daily, the English-language version of one of the main state newspapers, regularly publishes advertising supplements in newspapers around the country, including The New York Times. They generally offer an informative, if anodyne, view of world affairs refracted through the lens of the Communist Party.
"The China Daily advertisement insert is clearly labeled and meets our advertising acceptability standards," said Ari Isaacman Bevacqua, a Times spokeswoman. "The New York Times covers China thoroughly and aggressively, and at no time has advertising influenced our coverage."
However, some experts on China say China Daily pushes insidious propaganda onto foreign readers, especially in its attempts to whitewash vast human rights abuses against Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities.
Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, has repeatedly denounced China Daily. The paper, she said on Twitter last year, was "nothing more than a mouthpiece for a government that conflates peaceful criticism with terrorism, crushes peaceful protests, and arbitrarily detains shocking numbers of #Uyghurs and other #Muslims."
One issue in particular drew the attention of the White House in 2018. An advertisement placed in The Des Moines Register highlighted the benefits of free trade for Iowa's farmers at a time Mr. Trump was excoriating what he called China's unfair trade practices.
Mr. Trump, in typical fashion, responded on Twitter.

Texto completo: A separatist assault was seen as aimed at weakening Ukraine's president and gaining leverage in talks to end the war in the country's east.
Russian-backed separatists tried on Tuesday to break through the trench line in the stalemated war in eastern Ukraine, killing one government soldier and wounding four others, the Ukrainian military said.
In the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the attack was seen more as a diplomatic feint than a military assault, an effort to gain leverage during talks to end the war. In response, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, convened an emergency meeting of his national security council. The Kremlin denied any involvement.
After a phase of widespread violence in 2014 and 2015, the war settled into a dreary back-and-forth along a frontier consisting of about 270 miles of trenches.
Despite a negotiated cease-fire, skirmishes break out daily, most of them with long-distance artillery. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported nearly 300,000 cease-fire violations by both sides last year, counting every explosion or burst of gunfire its monitors hear along the front.
The attack on Tuesday, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, was unusual in that the separatists tried to overrun a Ukrainian trench line and seize additional territory. It was the first such attack in two years, the military said.
Mr. Zelensky called the action an "attempt to disrupt the peace process" but did not directly blame the Russian government.
"Our course, our commitment to end the war and to international agreements remains unchanged," he wrote in a social media post. "As does our determination to repel any manifestation of armed aggression against Ukraine."
In a conference call with journalists, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov expressed condolences for the dead but said that "it would be wrong to say that the Kremlin is responsible for whatever happens there."
The fighting broke out in a remote area of farmland and villages carved by a network of trenches that has been a hot spot in the conflict for years.
The Ukrainian Army said it began with an artillery barrage near the village of Krymske, followed by the unsuccessful attempt to overrun its trenches, but the military provided no further details. The fighting killed one separatist soldier and wounded five others.
The attack, carried out just a few miles from a "disengagement zone" where Ukrainian troops had pulled back from the front, seemed to have been calculated to create political problems for Mr. Zelensky.
Creating these sites has been a signature policy of the Ukrainian president, who won an election last year promising to negotiate an end to the war. But the voluntary pullbacks have incensed his Ukrainian nationalist opposition at home.
The escalation near the disengagement zone in the town of Zolote was intended to "force Zelensky into talks in an unfavorable position" at home politically, said Yevhan Mahda, an analyst in Kyiv.
"Unfortunately, the Kremlin feels the weakness of Ukraine's leadership in its unwillingness to raise the stakes," Mr. Mahda said. "Zelensky came to power on a program of peace, and the Kremlin understands this."
The fighting on Tuesday came three days after Mr. Zelensky's government rejected a 12-point plan to reduce tensions, a proposal promoted by former Russian, European and American government officials at a security conference in Munich.
That plan was seen as echoing pro-Russian positions, such as promoting a partial rollback of Western economic sanctions on Russia before a final peace deal and encouraging Ukraine to sign a trade deal with Russia.
It also suggested that Ukraine should engage in a national debate about "themes of history and national memory, language" and identity that would include Russian perspectives, something also sure to enrage the nationalist opposition.
Mr. Zelensky had been pressing for an end to Russian deployments of weapons and soldiers into Ukraine under a formula that would allow joint patrols by Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and local citizens along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The Kremlin has rejected that idea.
The attack came on the fifth anniversary of a major escalation by Russian-backed separatists and regular Russian Army troops that forced Ukraine into the settlement plan known as the Minsk II agreement.

Texto completo: A group representing Asian-American students is appealing a judge's ruling that Harvard did not explicitly discriminate against them by boosting other racial and ethnic groups.
A group that opposes affirmative action filed an appeal Tuesday of a federal ruling that Harvard had not intentionally discriminated against Asian-American applicants, ratcheting up a challenge to decades of Supreme Court decisions upholding race-conscious selection in college admissions.
The appeal comes four and a half months after federal Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that although Harvard's admissions system was "not perfect," it nonetheless met the legal standard needed to ensure that it was not motivated by racial prejudice or stereotyping.
In their brief, however, the plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, representing a group of Asian-American students rejected by Harvard, seized on the judge's own critiques of Harvard's admissions process to argue that she had too easily given the school the benefit of the doubt.
They noted that in her decision, Judge Burroughs said that the analysis presented by the plaintiffs, which they said showed bias against Asian-American applicants, could be used to show possible "implicit" or unconscious bias in the system.
But while the judge said she would "not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better," the plaintiffs urged the appeals court to do so. They interpreted the judge's willingness to concede uncertainty on some of the points as evidence that there was ample room for a higher court to contest the ruling.
"At every critical juncture," the court "gave Harvard the benefit of the doubt -- and it still could not confidently find that Harvard treats Asian Americans fairly," the opening brief of the appeal, filed Tuesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Massachusetts, said. Legal experts said the appeals court is required to take the case and will likely hear oral arguments, moving the final decision in the case one step closer to the Supreme Court.
Students for Fair Admissions includes more than a dozen Asian-American students who applied to Harvard and were rejected. They contend in their lawsuit that Harvard systematically discriminates against Asian-American applicants in violation of federal civil rights law, by penalizing their high achievement as a group, while giving preferences to other racial and ethnic minorities. They say that Harvard's admission process amounts to an illegal quota system.
Harvard says its admissions system is finely calibrated to produce a spectrum of diversity, not only of race, but of income, ideas, geographic origin and talents. The group's appellate filing "further exposes their ultimate goal of removing the consideration of race in college and university admissions," Harvard said in a statement Tuesday.
Derek W. Black, a constitutional law professor at the University of South Carolina, said Tuesday that the appeal was "grasping at straws to a certain extent."
"Two people could look at the same facts and arrive at different conclusions," he said. "That's the judge's call to make."
The group initially filed the case against Harvard in 2014, and spent years in an ultimately successful battle to get access to tens of thousands of pages of internal Harvard admissions records, many of which were made public.
The three-week trial, which took place in the fall of 2018, riveted spectators because of the arcane secrets of Harvard admissions that it revealed. There was the existence of a "dean's or director's list" that included the children of wealthy donors who received special consideration in admissions. And there was the "lop list," a list of students whom admissions officers felt could be cut at the last minute, to balance the composition of the class the way they wanted to.
The appellate brief argues that the judge gave too little weight to the statistical analysis of bias in Harvard's admissions presented by the plaintiffs, and too much credence to the testimony of Harvard's admissions officers, which the brief called "self-serving."
"A defendant's insistence that it does not discriminate, however credible or indignant, is not evidence in its favor," the brief says.
In presenting the case, the plaintiffs argued that because the share of academically qualified Asian-American applicants was so high, Harvard resorted to using a subjective "personal" rating, which trafficked in stereotypes about Asian-Americans being quiet and studious, to winnow down the number it admitted. Harvard responded that descriptions like quiet and studious had been used for students who were not Asian-American as well, and that admissions officers looked not just at the larger group, but at more disadvantaged subsets of Asian-Americans, like Cambodians or Vietnamese.
Students for Fair Admissions has filed another affirmative action case against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which is scheduled to go to trial in May. It is a more classic case, arguing that the university could bring in more black and Hispanic students, albeit of slightly lower academic caliber, if it used race-neutral alternatives.
The plaintiffs in the Harvard case received support from the Trump administration, which argued for the release of the school's admissions documents, and which has opened a parallel discrimination investigation based on a 2015 complaint to the Justice Department by a coalition of Asian-American organizations.
The leader of Students for Fair Admissions and the architect of the case against Harvard is Edward Blum, a longtime crusader against affirmative action who has raised millions of dollars from conservative groups to challenge voting rights laws and affirmative action policies, often successfully.
Harvard has received support from other Ivy League schools, which use similar admissions systems, which could also be threatened if the plaintiffs were to win in the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: The film producer's lawyer urged jurors to do "what they know is right," prompting the prosecution to complain of jury tampering.
Over the weekend, just days before jurors in the Harvey Weinstein case were set to begin deliberations, his lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, wrote an opinion piece imploring them "to do what they know is right."
The article in Newsweek magazine infuriated the Manhattan district attorney's office, and on Tuesday the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, called Ms. Rotunno's behavior "inappropriate," and tantamount to jury tampering.
The judge ordered the defense team not to speak to the news media until after a verdict is reached.
"Defense team you are ordered to refrain from communicating with the press until there is a verdict in the case," Justice James M. Burke told Mr. Weinstein's lawyers. "I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut."
The jurors were not in the courtroom at the time. As in many high-profile cases, jurors have been reminded every day by the judge not to follow any news media coverage of the case.
The judge's order came just before he gave the jury final instructions. The panel of seven men and five women began deliberating at 11:30 a.m.
A half-hour later, the jurors sent a note to the judge asking for definitions of legal terms like consent and forcible compulsion, as well as written definitions of the charges against Mr. Weinstein and whether they could find him guilty of certain combinations of charges.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault.
The main charges in the indictment rest on the testimony of two women: Miriam Haley, a former production assistant who said the producer forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006, and Jessica Mann, a former actress who accused him of raping her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013.
But prosecutors are also using the testimony of the actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Mr. Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s, to bolster the charge that he is a sexual predator, even though the alleged attack is too old to be charged as a separate crime.
In their first note, the jurors also asked for an explanation about why the statute of limitations prevented a conviction based solely on Ms. Sciorra's account. Her testimony was pivotal because if the jury finds her credible and also finds Mr. Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Ms. Haley or Ms. Mann, he can be found guilty of predatory sexual assault, which carries a life sentence.
To demonstrate a pattern of abuse, three other women were allowed to testify about their accusations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. But he is not charged with crimes in those cases.
Shortly after 3 p.m., the jurors sent out a second note requesting the layout of Mr. Weinstein's Manhattan loft, suggesting they were reviewing Ms. Haley's allegation that the producer forced her to let him perform oral sex on her there in 2006. The jury also requested three emails in which Mr. Weinstein had listed people -- he called them "red flags" -- he wanted an Israeli intelligence firm, Black Cube, to investigate. Ms. Sciorra was on that list.
The argument in the morning was the third time the prosecution had called Ms. Rotunno's public comments into question since the trial began with jury selection on Jan. 6.
Last month, prosecutors requested a gag order after Ms. Rotunno criticized Mr. Weinstein's accusers in interviews with reporters. They made the same complaint after she participated in a New York Times podcast, in which she said, among other things, that she had never been sexually assaulted "because I would never put myself in that position."
Prosecutors said Ms. Rotunno had also, in The Times's podcast, called the accusers liars who were seeking fame. At the time, the judge warned the defense not to talk about the witnesses.
On Sunday, Ms. Rotunno took a new approach, addressing the jury of seven men and five women directly in her 284-word opinion piece in Newsweek.
"I implore the members of this jury to do what they know is right and was expected of them from the moment they were called upon to serve their civic duty in a court of law," she wrote.
"The facts are the facts. Harvey Weinstein is innocent," she went on. "His fate hangs in the balance, and the world is watching."
Ms. Illuzzi, who read an excerpt from Ms. Rotunno's essay, asked Justice Burke to order that Mr. Weinstein be held in custody during the jury deliberations. She suggested that the film producer was behind the decision to make a last-minute appeal to the jury through Newsweek.
"It is 100 percent inappropriate behavior," Ms. Illuzzi said. "No way Ms. Rotunno did this without the prompting and encouragement and the knowledge and the permission of this defendant. It cannot be allowed in this courtroom or any courtroom in the country."
Ms. Rotunno told the judge that she was seeking to counter the prosecution's narrative that Mr. Weinstein is a predator.
"It is one small piece of a large media attack on Mr. Weinstein every single day and for the D.A.'s office to act like they don't talk to the media just because their name isn't in the article is ridiculous," Ms. Rotunno said. "I did not say anything beyond the bounds of what our system should do."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

New Boy Scouts trail: Bankruptcy National group files for Chapter 11 amid sex abuse lawsuits

Texto completo: Hoping to contain a growing deluge of sexual abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America took shelter in bankruptcy court Tuesday, filing for Chapter 11 protection that will let it keep operating while it grapples with serious questions about whether the century-old Scouting movement has a viable future.
The bankruptcy filing affects only the national organization, not the state and local councils that run Scouting programs day to day. Even so, the case sets up one of the most complex and uncertain financial restructurings in American history. Thousands of people have already lodged allegations that they were abused as Scouts, and many more are expected to come forward.
The Boy Scouts, whose mission to promote patriotism, courage, self-reliance and kindred virtues was enshrined in a rare congressional charter in 1916, said it plans to continue its work "for many years to come."
The bankruptcy court in Delaware that is handling the case is likely to freeze the lawsuits against the group and set a deadline for filing any more claims. But Jim Turley, the group's national chairman, said in an open letter to victims of sexual abuse that the Boy Scouts were not trying to dodge responsibility for compensating them. Instead, he said, the organization wanted to do so as equitably as possible through a victim's compensation trust, rather than piecemeal in lawsuit after lawsuit.
"I want you to know that we believe you, we believe in compensating you, and we have programs in place to pay for counseling for you and your family by a provider of your choice," Turley said.
Tim Kosnoff, a lawyer for an Abused in Scouting group that now has close to 2,000 clients, said that while he's open to hearing how the Boy Scouts intends to reform itself, he finds it "difficult to impossible" to envision the organization operated in a restructured form.
"It would require changing into something people wouldn't recognize as Scouting," said Kosnoff, noting the organization's history of sending boys on remote outings with volunteer leaders.
Over the span of a century, more than 130 million Americans have participated in the Boy Scouts. But membership has been dwindling in recent decades, as shifting attitudes pulled many families away from the God-and-country oaths and outdoorsy survival skills that Scouting offered. Then, in more recent years, lawsuits brought to light a long history of sexual abuse problems that the organization strove to keep secret.
The Boy Scouts have maintained internal files about abuse cases at their headquarters almost since the group was founded in 1910s. In a 1935 article in The New York Times, the organization described having files on hundreds of people who had been leaders in the Scouts but had been labeled "degenerates." In recent years, an expert hired by the organization reviewed decades of records and reported that there were nearly 8,000 "perpetrators."
The Boy Scouts fought the release of some of the files in an Oregon case in the early 2000s - a case that led a jury to hold the Scouts liable for $18.5 million in punitive damages in 2010. The records in that case stayed private until a ruling from the Oregon Supreme Court in 2012 made them public.
Paul Mones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, said he recalled musing with a colleague that those files might be the tip of an iceberg that could ultimately drive the Boy Scouts toward bankruptcy. But instead of trying to establish a compensation fund for victims over the years, he said, the organization continued trying to protect its reputation.
Mones expressed concern that the bankruptcy filing Tuesday would rob other victims of the opportunity to hold the Scouts accountable in court. "The justice that they so well-deserved will unfortunately escape them in the end,," he said.
Last year, the Abused in Scouting group began advertising around the country for people who were abused as Scouts to come forward and found nearly 2,000 people with complaints. The clients range in age from 8 to 93. Kosnoff said hundreds of the claimants are people who do not appear in the Boy Scouts' internal files.
With the group now seeking bankruptcy protection, Kosnoff said, "If you've ever considered coming forward, now is the time."
Over the years, the Boy Scouts held a singular position in the shaping of American boyhood, with a Scout law that demands loyalty, obedience and reverence. Former Scouts who rose to prominence include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford, astronaut Neil Armstrong, civil rights icon Ernest Green and film director Steven Spielberg.
But the group, which had around 5 million members in the 1970s, has only half that number now. In response, the Boy Scouts have tried to shift closer to evolving societal norms. Membership requirements were changed to allow openly gay Scouts in 2013 and then openly gay leaders in 2015. The Boy Scouts expanded to allow girls to participate starting in 2017. But the legal pressures from past sexual abuse continued to mount.
Other organizations in crisis over similar legacies of sexual abuse and secrecy have also sought bankruptcy protection, including Roman Catholic dioceses and USA Gymnastics.

U.S. targets China's media influence

Texto completo: BEIJING " The State Department on Tuesday designated five Chinese media outlets as official government entities under the Foreign Missions Act, meaning they will be treated as though they are diplomatic outposts of the Chinese government and subject to the same constraints.
The move is the latest in a series of U.S. efforts to tackle China's influence in the United States. It will be sure to anger Beijing, which generally views U.S. government actions " such as the trade war, accusations against tech firm Huawei and criticism of the country's human rights record " as efforts to thwart China's global rise.
The media outlets are the U.S. entities of the official Xinhua News Agency; China Global Television Network, known as CGTN, the international arm of state broadcaster CCTV; China Radio International; the China Daily newspaper; and the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China.
The 1982 Foreign Missions Act covers matters such as license plates for embassy vehicles and diplomatic immunity, but it also governs how foreign governments operate in the United States.
Practically speaking, Tuesday's decision was probably more symbolic than punitive.
The news outlets will be required to provide lists of their staffs, including names, ages and addresses, and update them when there are changes. They also must get State Department approval to purchase or lease real estate, though that requirement does not apply to individual employees who buy or rent housing.
That information will be shared with other government agencies, including intelligence units, said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under department rules for briefing reporters.
American officials have become increasingly concerned in recent years that Chinese authorities are using journalists to do government work in the United States, noting that a number of Chinese journalists enter the country on official passports, which are issued by governments to do official business. The State Department designation does not carry journalistic restrictions that would limit where reporters employed by the five outlets can do their jobs, including attending State briefings or news conferences.
Two State officials, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss internal considerations on whether Beijing will retaliate against foreign reporters working in China.
'We're painfully aware of the very tough operating environment that U.S. and other foreign journalists operate under in China. . . . It's already the case that freedom of the press is under severe siege in the People's Republic of China,' one official said.
The five organizations are part of a huge propaganda apparatus that transmits the Communist Party's views to China and the world. Democracy advocates have warned about China's increasingly aggressive attempts to shape the global narrative about its actions at home and abroad.
The United States has struggled to find a way to respond forcefully while protecting free speech.
'Because we are an open, transparent society, our tool set is limited as to what we can actually do,' said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
In 2018, the Justice Department ordered Xinhua and CGTN to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as part of an effort to combat influence operations.
What the United States has done so far, Glaser said, 'doesn't stop them from sending out the messages they are sending.'
But it does flag the issue for the public. 'It is alerting people to pay attention to the fact that the message that these organizations give out is one that the Chinese Communist Party wants them to hear, not what we consider real, objective journalism,' she added.
Under leader Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has dramatically stepped up pervasive censorship and state control inside China and extended efforts to reach readers and viewers elsewhere.
'China is trying to promote itself as an international model,' said Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for China at Freedom House and the author of a report, 'Beijing's Global Megaphone,' released in January. Cook said, 'Beijing has a large toolbox for influencing media around the world, and its tactics have been evolving, especially since 2017.'
In the United States, these media organizations have Chinese reporters dispatched to provide news about the United States to a Chinese audience. But they also have stepped up efforts to reach the American market.
When Xi toured state media outlets in 2016, he told them to 'speak for the party' and 'tell China's story to the world.'
Xi has said repeatedly that 'telling stories is the best form of international dissemination' when it comes to telegraphing China's messages to the world, said David Bandurski of China Media Project.
By inclusion in cable packages, CGTN America, which is based in Washington, has been able to reach an estimated 30 million households in the United States.
The China Daily, its English-language paper, is available on newsstands in places such as New York and congressional offices in Washington. China Daily has also adopted a practice it calls 'borrowing the boat to reach the sea' to place its content in advertorial 'China Watch' supplements in newspapers, including The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
Xinhua produces copy that is highly favorable to the Chinese government, by disseminating the official view on events such as the Hong Kong protests and detention camps for Muslims in Xinjiang or publishing stories that are sharply critical of adversaries, with the United States being public enemy number one. In the Soviet era, Russian news organizations such as Tass and Pravda were designated foreign missions. Several years ago, the Vietnam News Agency also received the designation.

Bloomberg's new plan to rein in Wall Street includes tax he once opposed

Texto completo: As the mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg often jumped to defend Wall Street and rebut calls for tough banking industry regulations after the global financial crisis.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg, who is running for president in the Democratic primary, announced an extensive proposal that appears to reverse many of his former positions. It would reinstate tougher oversight for giant banks, institute a financial transactions tax and strengthen consumer protection laws.
Among other things, the plan would also make it easier for the Justice Department to prosecute bankers for violations of the law.
Bloomberg released the plan just a day before he was scheduled to confront his Democratic rivals on the debate stage for the first time. He is likely to be asked about whether has been too cozy with Wall Street in the past. He has faced backlash for a past interview in which he blamed the 2008 financial crisis on politicians who had pushed to end racially discriminatory mortgage-lending policies known as 'redlining.'
Bloomberg's proposal would take on some of the biggest customers of his namesake financial data company, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, as well as hedge funds and high-frequency traders.
Many of the proposals are similar to those of his most liberal Democratic rivals. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), for example, introduced a plan last year to make it easier to lock up corporate CEOs. But he doesn't go as far as Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) in some areas, such as a wealth tax on the richest Americans.
Wall Street has been a frequent target of the Democratic presidential candidates, and Bloomberg's long-standing deep connections to the industry have been viewed as a potential weak point in his campaign.
One of the measures most likely to worry Wall Street is his proposal to create a financial transaction tax of 0.1-percent for every stock or bond traded. It would be phased in, starting at 0.02-percent, according to the proposal. Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have supported legislation that would impose a similar tax. Warren has proposed using a financial transaction tax to help pay for her health-care plan.
Bloomberg previously had objected to a financial transaction tax, concerned that if the United States imposed such a fee, the financial industry would migrate overseas, said Stu Loeser, a senior adviser to the Bloomberg campaign. But since then, several countries, including Britain and Hong Kong, have imposed similar taxes, he said. 'Their experience shows the markets can flourish with [a tax,] and that takes care of our concern of America being the only one,' Loeser said.
'The world has changed since the financial crisis. It has changed in lots of ways, including the need for greater efforts to combat inequality,' he said.
Bloomberg, who has spent more than $300-million on his presidential campaign, got his start on Wall Street at Salomon Brothers before starting his financial data company. As mayor of New York, he often came to the industry's defense. After a former Goldman Sachs employee wrote a scathing New York Times op-ed calling the corporate environment 'toxic and destructive,' Bloomberg reportedly visited the bank's headquarters the next day in support of employees. 'Goldman Sachs is a firm that's been around for well over 100 years, and it's a great firm,' he said during a radio interview.
Before the financial crisis, Bloomberg argued at a 2006 conference that Wall Street was already over-regulated, recalled former congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.), one of the chief authors of the financial reform bill known as the Dodd-Frank Act. After the crisis, he continued to raise objections to new regulations, Frank said.
'I think he was still a Republican back then,' he said. 'The financial industry is one of the top employers and revenue generators in New York, and he was acting like any local representative protecting his moneymaker.'
In a 2010 letter to Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), Bloomberg warned about taking 'punitive actions' against the industry. 'The world adjusts to stupid laws,' he said in 2014 before the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, one of Wall Street's biggest lobbying groups. 'They just don't pay attention to it, and you get burned later on. That really is what happens, like a 25-mile-an-hour speed limit.'
The New Yorker's change of heart is probably a reflection of political reality, and his previous positions should not be disqualifying, Frank said. 'I am very pleased that he has decided to come around,' he said.

Texto completo: "I think the important point to make about slavery is that it had existed for thousands of years without substantial criticism," said the historian Gordon Wood in an interview last year. "But it's the American Revolution that makes it a problem for the world. And the first real anti-slave movement takes place in North America. So this is what's missed by these essays in the 1619 Project."
Mr. Wood is one of the country's leading experts on the colonial era, and he was referring to a collection of New York Times articles published last summer that examine the role of slavery in American history. The project posits that the country's real founding occurred not in 1776 but in 1619, when the first African slaves arrived in Virginia. The claim is that the Revolutionary War was fought primarily to preserve America's "slavocracy," and that the country has risen politically, economically and culturally only through the subjugation of blacks.
Since publication, both the Times and its staff writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project's creator, have come under sharp criticism from prominent academics. Now entering the fray is Robert Woodson, a black conservative and longtime community activist in Washington. Last week Mr. Woodson held a press conference to announce his own "1776 Project," which is intended to counter what he called the "anti-America propaganda" of the Times's endeavor. What's troubling about "1619" is that "it defines America as being incurably racist," he said. It insists that "all white people are beneficiaries of privilege and . . . victimizers. And all blacks are victims."
Ms. Hannah-Jones has dismissed her detractors as "old white male historians," but Mr. Woodson doesn't fit that bill. Nor do a good number of the scholars he recruited—Glenn Loury, Carol Swain, John McWhorter, Jason Hill and Wilfred Reilly—to write essays that provide an "aspirational and inspirational" counternarrative to the Times's. The pieces will appear on the Washington Examiner's website and at 1776unites.com.
Mr. Loury described the absurdity of demonizing Western civilization for an institution that predates it. "Slavery was a fact of human civilization since antiquity," he said at the press conference. "Abolition is the new idea. And that is a Western idea not possible without the democratic institutions that were built in 1776." And in her essay, Ms. Swain reminds us that no single group is blameless, a fact the "1619 Project" all but ignores. "Those who push white guilt and black victimhood ignore critical facts," she writes . "One is that today's white Americans are not responsible for the sins of generations ago. Second, slavery was an institution that blacks, Native Americans, and whites participated in as slaveholders. There's plenty of guilt to go around there."
Mr. Woodson believes his project will correct a false and fatalistic narrative and provide an optimistic path forward for the black underclass. The Times's "negative message is dangerous to the future because it discourages blacks" from trying, and "nothing is more lethal than a good excuse for failing."
None of this is to play down numerous errors and omissions of the "1619 Project." The essays contend, for example, that slavery produced "dizzying profits" and "helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus." But as the historian Wilfred McClay explained in Commentary magazine in October, scholars have blasted such claims are "demonstrably wrong" and based on "elementary accounting errors, incorrectly double- and triple-counting intermediate transaction costs in a way that greatly inflates the final figure."
And to Ms. Hannah-Jones's assertion that "for the most part, black Americans fought back alone," the historian James McPherson offered this : "From the Quakers in the 18th century, on through the abolitionists in the antebellum, to the radical Republicans in the Civil War and Reconstruction, to the NAACP which was an interracial organization founded in 1909, down through the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, there have been a lot of whites who have fought against slavery and racial discrimination, and against racism. Almost from the beginning of American history that's been true. And that's what's missing from this perspective."
The "1619 Project" is being adopted as part of the curriculum in thousands of classrooms across the country. The political left is already in the process of turning our K-12 schools into social-justice boot camps, and this will expedite that effort. Properly understood, the "1619 Project" isn't about black history. It's about today's racial disparities. It's about applying current ideologies to past events, in the continuing attempt to blame the past actions of whites for the current problems of blacks. Mr. Woodson understands that this is not only dishonest but damaging. Why doesn't the New York Times?

Texto completo: Headnote Virginia, newly dominated by Democrats, may broaden parole for the first time in a generation. Others states are watching.
WAVERLY, Va. - After Zenas Barnes was convicted of three robberies in the 1990s, he accepted a plea deal that stunned even veteran lawyers for its severity: 150 years in state prison.
Barnes, who was 21 at the time, said that he had not realized when he took the deal that the Virginia Legislature had, only months before, abolished the most common type of parole, meaning that there was a good chance he would die in prison.
Twenty-five years later, the state Legislature, newly dominated by Democrats, is poised to broaden parole for the first time in a generation. The move would give Barnes and thousands of other prisoners convicted of violent crimes a chance for parole, which allows inmates to be released early.
Watching closely are lawmakers across the nation, including in California, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Like Virginia, those states decades ago virtually eliminated discretionary parole, granted by appointed boards on a conditional basis, during an era of surging violent crime and the imposition of progressively harsher punishments.
"We thought we were fighting crime, and it didn't work," said David Marsden, a Democratic state senator in Virginia who has previously introduced bills to restore parole but was blocked by Republican majorities. "But more recently, we've stopped trying to teach lessons and started trying to solve problems. People are now more likely to believe that people deserve a second chance."
After watching the nation's prison population grow by 500% since the 1980s, lawmakers have aggressively sought to reduce prison rolls as part of a growing consensus that the criminal justice system has incarcerated too many Americans.
Louisiana, for instance, the state with the nation's highest incarceration rate, has in recent years cut its prison population to a level not seen since the 1990s. Last year, New York approved a law ending cash bail for most people charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent felony crimes, a move aimed at preventing people from being held for longer periods only because they could not afford to pay bail.
On the federal level, President Donald Trump signed legislation in December 2018 that shortened prison terms for some federal inmates.
Still, analysts said recent attempts to restore parole in California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere were beaten back amid political pressure on lawmakers over concerns that someone released on parole could commit a serious violent crime.
Even after Virginia lawmakers abolished many forms of parole in the 1990s, some types of it remained available, including the possibility of parole for prisoners older than 61 and for inmates arrested before Jan. 1,1995.
Gone, though, for new inmates was the sort of parole most inmates had previously been released on. On parole, offenders are generally allowed to serve the remainders of their sentences outside of prison with stipulations that they meet regularly with a parole officer, stay employed, get counseling, and pass drug and alcohol tests. If they fail to adhere to the rules, they will often go back to prison.
Separate from parole, Virginia has retained a probation system for jail inmates who have been convicted of misdemeanor crimes and who are also monitored regularly by authorities. The state also allows prison inmates to be released early for good behavior, although prisoners are required to serve at least 85% of their sentences.
Even in Virginia, where Democrats won majorities in both chambers of the Legislature in November, and which also has a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, the question of expanding parole remains politically perilous. This month, Democrats shelved a bill that would have restored the possibility of parole for nearly 17,000 inmates - more than half the state's prison population. Instead, Democrats have focused on more modest efforts to restore parole to older inmates.
"The prevailing attitude of policymakers is, we've come to the limit because they don't want to release violent offenders," said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that advocates for shorter sentences and other policy changes to the criminal justice system.
There is no significant difference in violent crime rates between states that allow parole and those that do not, according to federal data.
But Mauer said many people associate parolees with recidivism and violence, and their crimes often garner significant public attention.
Republican lawmakers have warned that restoring parole would make Virginia - which has the fourth lowest violent crime rate of any state - more dangerous.
"When parole is granted, it w ill result in violent criminals being released into our communities," said Robert Bell, a Republican member of the House of Delegates. Bell added that parole "will force victims of violent crimes and their families to relive the worst day of their lives over and over again."
The Virginia Victim Assistance Network, a crime victims' advocacy group, also opposes widening the number of people who can get parole.
"Violent crime offenders should be held accountable for the crimes they have committed against victims and their families," a statement from the group said.
Kate McCord, associate director of the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the organization had not taken an official position on parole. If it is restored, she said, parole boards should have broad discretion.
"It is in the best interest of survivors to have a parole board look at the record of the person incarcerated, the crimes they committed, and whether they had made an effort to rehabilitate themselves," she said. "And those being released should have adequate support in terms of finding employment and having access to stable housing."
Both chambers of the Virginia Legislature have already approved a bill that would make hundreds of prison inmates eligible for parole because they were convicted by juries that were not informed by courts that defendants were no longer eligible for parole after the practice was abolished in 1995.
Northam has said he will support it.
Other bills expected to be approved include a measure that would restore the possibility of parole to thousands of inmates who have served 20 years or more of their sentences. Another would grant parole eligibility to prisoners who are older than 50, a group that may number in the thousands. The governor has not yet said whether he supports those bills.
During a quarter-century in prison, Barnes said he had watched as inmates tried and convicted of murder came and went, serving sentences shorter than the ones that were common during the 1990s at the height of the toughon-crime era.
Inside the Sussex II State Prison, about an hour's drive south of Richmond, Virginia, Barnes, 46, wore a prison-issue blue shirt and bluejeans. Guards did not remove his handcuffs. His salt-and-pepper beard was neatly trimmed, and his head had been freshly shaved.
"I've owned my guilt from the beginning," he said of his robberies, the last of which ended with him being shot eight times by police. He spent nearly a month in the hospital recovering from the shooting. "I'm just asking for a little bit of mercy. I didn't deserve 150 years for the crime, but we're past that. I'm rehabilitated. I've overhauled my thinking."
In 1995, when Barnes was 20, he and a friend pretended to be carrying concealed guns and robbed three fastfood restaurants in Norfolk, Virginia, in the span of a few weeks.
Barnes said that his public defender told him he was facing 600 years in prison but that if he accepted a plea deal for 150 years, he could be released on parole in as little as five years.
"I was too green to know better," Barnes said. His robbery partner had already been convicted and sentenced to more than 40 years.
David Hargett, a lawyer who would later represent Barnes on an appeal, said that taking a plea bargain with a 150-year sentence in a non-death-penalty case had been "inadvisable, unreasonable and contrary to all conceivable reason."
Barnes' original lawyer, who was his public defender, Duncan St. Clair, did not respond to a letter or multiple phone messages left at his office.
But during a hearing to consider overturning the sentence in 2001, St. Clair denied misleading Barnes. "It was the best plea agreement that I could get," St. Clair told the judge. "It wasn't a good plea agreement. It wasn't a happy day, but it was the best I could do."
Records show that St. Clair's law license was revoked by the Virginia State Bar in 2015 for misconduct, including lying to clients.
For Barnes, long stretches of idle prison time had helped him better understand his own shortcomings, he said.
"I was able to use this time to learn about myself - that it's about progress, not perfection," he said. "I'm proud of the man I grew into."

Texto completo: Lawrence W. Pierce, a longtime federal judge who voided a New York state law banning the sale of contraceptives to minors and joined in a decision to overturn New York City's elected government structure as unconstitutional, died Wednesday, Feb. 5,2002, at his home in Boca Raton, Florida. He was 95.
Pierce, who was born in Philadelphia, was the first Black student to graduate from St. Joseph's College (now St. Joseph's University) in Philadelphia.
His son Michael confirmed the death.
Pierce, a Republican who had been nominated to the federal courts by Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, was only the third Black judge to serve on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, after Thurgood Marshall and Amalya Lyle Kearse. He was the first Black judge to be appointed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
In 1975, writing for a threejudge appellate panel, Pierce rejected New York state's claim that limiting access to contraceptives was a proper exercise of police powers to promote morality among minors. The law empowered only licensed pharmacists to sell nonprescription contraceptives and declared that they could not be advertised or openly displayed. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the judges' ruling, voiding the law.
Explaining why access to contraceptives should not be constricted, Pierce wrote, "It is not beyond the power of this court to note that some young persons under the age of 16, including some in New York State, do engage in sexual intercourse and that the consequences of such activity is often venereal disease, unwanted pregnancy, or both."
Pierce concurred in two appeals court rulings that the structure of New York City's elected government violated the principle of one-person, one-vote and required an overhaul.
In 1982, the court affirmed a decision that electing two City Council members at-large from each of the five boroughs disproportionately empowered smaller boroughs.
Applying the same standard in 1987, the court declared that the Board of Estimate, the preeminent governing body, whose voting members included the borough presidents, was unconstitutional. The court pointed out that each borough president cast the same number of votes, even though the s: ze of the boroughs' populations varied widely. The boa rd was subsequently abolished by a referendum that amended the City Charter.
In a complicated but consequential case in 1973, Pierce ruled that ownersh ip shares of apartments in the state's giant Co-op City housing project in the Bronx did not constitute securities under federal law because purchasers were obligated to resell their shares to theco-op at the original sale price.
In 1986, writing for a divided court, he upheld the securities fraud conviction of a former repotter for The Wall Street Journal who had traded stocks on the basis of his advance knowledge of information that was to appear in a column he wrote, "Heard on the Street."
"Judge Pierce will be remembered as a fair, impartial and disciplined jurist, who weighed each decision carefully, on the merits, and applied the law meticulously," said T. Christopher Donnelly, a former law clerk of Pierce's. "On the bench and off the bench, he was thoughtful, dignified, respectful and kind."
Lawrence Warren Pierce was born Dec. 31, 1924, in Philadelphia. His father, Harold E. Pierce Sr., was at various times a bank guard, a hospital orderly and a research assistant who left the family when Lawrence was 11. His mother, Mary Leóra (Bellinger) Pierce, a pianist who was known to have accompanied Marian Anderson, died of pneumonia when he was 5.
He was raised by his stepmother, Violet (Abrahams) Pierce, a nurse, and his paternal grandparents.
An uncle, who was a lawyer and prosecutor, inspired him to study law, he said. After serving in the Army in Italy during World War II, he became in 1948 the first Black student to graduate from St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia, then received a law degree from the Fordham University School of Law.
While he was never in private practice, Pierce was a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society and an assistant district attorney from 1954 to 1961 in Brooklyn, where his mentor was Assemblyman Bertram L. Baker, the borough's first Black state legislator.
He served as a deputy police commissioner for the department's youth program from 1961 to 1963 and as director of the state Division for Youth until 1966 under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.
In 1966, appointed by the governor, Pierce became the founding chairman of the New York State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. Thousands of addicts were undergoing compulsory residential treatment when he left the commission in 1970.
Nixon nominated Pierce to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1971. He sat on the surveillance court from 1979 to 1981, the year he became the only Black judge nominated by Reagan to the Court of Appeals. He assumed senior status in 1990 and retired in 1995.
He was married to Wilma (Taylor) Pierce, who died in 1978, and to Cynthia (Straker) Pierce, a former federal attorney and law school professor, who died in 2011. In addition to his son Michael, from his first marriage, he is survived by two other sons, Warren and Mark, also from his first marriage; five granddaughters; one grandson; and one great-granddaughter. All three sons are lawyers.
Pierce considered himself a patriot whose civil libertarianism dovetailed effortlessly with the Bill of Rights.
While he rejected the constitutionality of a New York law requiring that the American flag be displayed at assemblies and parades, he regularly participated in annual Flag Day ceremonies sponsored by the Sons of the Revolution at Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan. He qualified after discovering, as an amateur genealogist, that a forebear, Adam Pierce, the son of a Black seamaq and Dutch indentured servant, had served in the New Jersey Militia during the Revolutionary War.

Texto completo: Nikita Pearl Waligwa, the young Ugandan newcomer who starred in "Queen of Katwe," the 2016 Disney film about a chess champion's coming of age, has died of a brain tumor. She was 15.
Her death was announced Sunday by Gayaza High School, an all-girls boarding school outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala where Waligwa had been a student.
'You were a darling to many and we have lost you to a brain tumor at such a tender age," the high school said on TWitter.
The announcement prompted an outpouring of tributes from some of Waligwa's co-stars in "Queen of Katwe," which was based on a 2011 essay in ESPN The Magazine about a chess prodigy in Uganda who grows up in a slum and wins international competitions. The film starred Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo. It was listed as Waligwa's only film credit.
In the movie, Waligwa played Gloria, a friend of the protagonist, Phiona Mutēsi, who was played by Madina Nalwanga.
Phiona becomes a chess whiz with help from Gloria and under the tutelage of Robert Katende, played by Oyewolo.
The film was directed by Mira Nair and starred Nyong'o, an Oscar winner for "12 Years a Slave," as Phiona's mother.
"She played Gloria with such vibrancy," Nyong'o said on Instagram. "In her real life she had the enormous challenge of battling brain cancer. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and community as they come to terms with having to say goodbye so soon."
"Queen of Katwe" was :he film debut of both Waligwa and Nalwanga.
"We mourn the loss of our beautiful Nikita Pearl Wa.igwa," Oyewolo wrote on Instagram. "She was a ball of light in @queenofkatwemovie and in life. Her battle with a brain tumor was humbling to witness. Her light will live on."

Bernie Sanders is not a socialist

Texto completo: Republicans have a long, disreputable history of conflating any attempt to improve American lives with the evils of "socialism." When Medicare was first proposed, Ronald Reagan called it "socialized medicine," and he declared that it would destroy our freedom. These days, if you call for something like universal child care, conservatives accuse you of wanting to turn America into the Soviet Union.
It's a smarmy, dishonest political strategy, but it's hard to deny that it has sometimes been effective. And now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination - not an overwhelming front-runner, but clearly the person most likely at the moment to come out on top - is someone who plays right into that strategy, by declaring that he is indeed a socialist.
The thing is, Bernie Sanders isn't actually a socialist in any normal sense of the term. He doesn't want to nationalize our major industries and replace markets with central planning; he has expressed admiration, not for Venezuela, but for Denmark. He's basically what Europeans would call a social democrat - and social democracies like Denmark are, in fact, quite nice places to live, with societies that are, if anything, freer than our own.
So why does Sanders call himself a socialist? I'd say that it's mainly about personal branding, with a dash of glee at shocking the bourgeoisie. And this self-indulgence did no harm as long as he was just a senator from a very liberal state.
But if Sanders becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, his misleading self-description will be a gift to the Trump campaign. So will his policy proposals. Single-payer health care is (a) a good idea in principle and (b) very unlikely to happen in practice, but by making "Medicare for All" the centerpiece of his campaign, Sanders would take the focus off the Trump administration's determination to take away the social safety net we already have.
Just to be clear, if Sanders is indeed the nominee, the Democratic Party should give him its wholehearted support. He probably couldn't turn America into Denmark, and even if he could, President Donald Trump is trying to turn us into a white nationalist autocracy like Hungary. Which would you prefer?
But I do wish that Sanders weren't so determined to make himself an easy target for right-wing smears.
Speaking of unhelpful political posturing, the runner-up in New Hampshire has also been poisoning his own well. Over the past few days Pete Buttigieg has chosen to pose as a deficit hawk, thereby demonstrating that while he may be a fresh face, he has remarkably stale ideas.
Maybe Buttigieg is unaware of the growing consensus among mainstream economists that the deficit hysteria of seven or eight years ago was greatly overblown. Last year the former top economists in the Obama administration published an article titled "Who's Afraid of Budget Deficits?" which concluded, "It's time for Washington to put away its debt obsession and focus on bigger things."
And where Sanders is playing right into one disreputable Republican political strategy, Buttigieg is playing into another: the strategy of hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity when a Democrat occupies the White House, then borrowing freely as soon as the GOP regains power. If Democrats win, they should pursue a progressive agenda, not waste political capital cleaning up the GOP's mess.
Again, if Buttigieg somehow becomes the nominee, the party should back him without reservation. Whatever he may say about deficits, he wouldn't do what Republicans do: use debt fears as an excuse to slash social programs.
So who will the Democrats nominate? Your guess is as good as mine. What's really important, however, is that the party stays focused on its strengths and Trump's weaknesses.
For the fact is that all of the Democrats who would be president, from Bloomberg to Bernie, are at least moderately progressive; they all want to maintain and expand the social safety net, while raising taxes on the wealthy. And all the polling evidence says that America is basically a center-left nation - which is why Trump promised to raise taxes on the rich and protect major social programs during the 2016 campaign.
But he was lying, and at this point everyone with an open mind knows it. So Democrats have a perfect opportunity to portray themselves, truthfully, as the defenders of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the now-popular Affordable Care Act against Republicans who are more or less nakedly favoring the interests of plutocrats over those of working families.
This opportunity will, however, be squandered if the Democratic nominee, whoever he or she is, turns the election into a referendum on either single-payer health care or deficit reduction, neither of which is an especially popular position. Things will be even worse if the Democrats themselves degenerate into squabbles over either ideological purity or fiscal probity.
The point is that whoever gets the nomination, Democrats need to build as broad a coalition as possible. Otherwise they'll be handing the election to Trump - and that would be a tragedy for the party, the nation and the world.

Opioids settlement may be less than hoped

Texto completo: As talks escalate to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits nationwide, a harsh reality is emerging: The money the pharmaceutical industry will pay to compensate ravaged communities will likely be far less than once envisioned.
Lawyers on all sides have been stepping up efforts to reach a national agreement before the start of a New York trial next month. But even plaintiff lawyers now believe the payout from dozens of opioid makers, distributors and retailers is likely to be less than half of what the four Big Tobacco companies agreed to pay more than 20 years ago in a landmark settlement with states over costs associated with millions of smoking-related deaths.
Whatever the final amount, it will certainly fall well short of what public health experts say is needed to heal the long-term effects of the opioid crisis.
The tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled more than $206 billion over 25 years. When pressed to name the dollar figure he was swinging for, Joe Rice, chief negotiator for thousands of cities and counties suing the pharmaceutical industry who was also instrumental in wresting the tobacco settlement, conceded in an interview: "People would say I was crazy if I thought we could get over $100 billion."
Eric Percher, a senior analyst who follows the litigation for Nephron Research, an independent investment research firm, recently predicted that the total would end up between $75 billion and $85 billion.
Estimates vary wildly over just how much money it would take to finance the treatment and prevention programs, emergency services, law enforcement and other measures needed to fix the problems created by opioids. In October, the federal Council of Economic Advisers said that during the four-year period from 2015 through 2018, the economic toll from opioids was more than $2.5 trillion, including the cost of health care and law enforcement, and estimates of lost productivity.
The idea that some of the biggest U.S. corporations would not be made to cover a substantial portion of the opioid bill defies common sense to some people. But analysts and lawyers said the calculus to reach these settlements is even trickier than it was with the tobacco settlement.
For starters, four cigarette companies produced a single product - one whose dangers were undisputed. But prescription opioids are beneficial for some patients. In addition, the dozens of companies targeted in the opioid lawsuits "do some very good things," said Rice, including making or selling an array of medicines, vitamins and medical devices as well as drugstore products like shampoo and baby lotion.
They include health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson; some of the world's largest makers of generic medicines; huge drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and the national pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. Opioids usually represent only a sliver of their business. Even plaintiffs' lawyers say it may not be in the public interest to squeeze the companies too tightly.
Lawyers and economists also say that pharma will most likely pay less than Big Tobacco because, by one crude measure, its damage is smaller: prescription painkillers have claimed far fewer lives than cigarettes.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 218,000 people died from overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 through 2017. But each year, more than 480,000 people die from causes directly related to smoking or secondhand smoke.
Another challenge: apportioning blame. For cigarettes, that issue was relatively straightforward. The tobacco companies were almost entirely responsible for the manufacture, marketing, distribution and product placement of cigarettes. While the government could ban sales to minors, it had little authority to regulate marketing and distribution of tobacco until 2009.
So far, only two offers for a nationwide settlement have been disclosed. One offer, from Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, is valued by the company at about $10 billion, including at least $3 billion in cash from the members of the Sackler family, the owners. It has been tentatively accepted by about two dozen states and thousands of local governments but is far from final.
Another proposal, ostensibly worth $48 billion, is from the three drug distributors and two manufacturers (Teva and Johnson & Johnson), much of it to be paid over 18 years. But nearly half that figure is an in-kind assessment of the value of addiction treatment drugs and distribution services that the companies pledge to provide.
Twenty-one states and lawyers negotiating for cities and towns have called the proposal too skimpy, with too long a timetable for communities that need help immediately. Last week, they called for further talks.
A lawyer for one state supporting the offer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because discussions were confidential, said that these numbers were the best negotiators could extract.
So which defendants have the means to make a significant effect on recovery efforts?
The distributors argue that they do not have much extra cash. Percher, a former director of strategic finance at McKesson, explained that while McKesson's U.S. pharma and specialty division would generate $190 billion in revenue in 2020, making it eighth on the Fortune 500 list, its operating profit would total just $2.8 billion, or 1.47%.
The manufacturers present more of a mixed bag. Johnson & Johnson, despite its swarm of legal woes, is doing fine. But several makers of generic opioids carry a lot of debt and have weak bond ratings, analysts say.
Two companies that manufacture branded opioids, Insys Therapeutics, the maker of a fentanyl spray, and Purdue Pharma, are now in bankruptcy court, each struggling over restructuring plans to manage payouts, a model also being discussed as a possibility for some manufacturers.
The biggest unknown is how much the pharmacy chains can or should pay. Financially, this is the healthiest group of defendants. Their first trial, brought by two Ohio counties, is scheduled for November.
The chains are mostly being sued based on the quantity of opioids they distributed to their own pharmacies. Percher, the Nephron Research analyst, said that if the chains paid a figure proportional to what the national distributors offered, it would be about $13.8 billion.
"Could it be higher, given that they also dispensed the pills to the consumer?" he said. "Yes."
The delay in reaching a broad agreement has been due in some measure to sharp divisions among the many constituencies of plaintiffs themselves. Thousands of local governments view the states suspiciously, bitter because Big Tobacco settlement money largely wound up being diverted to state coffers.
The states that support the offer say that a major roadblock is the fee demanded by private lawyers who work both for some states and local governments. "We need to focus on getting dollars into treatment for those suffering, not into the pockets of lawyers," said Josh Shapiro, attorney general of Pennsylvania.
Rice scoffed at that notion, saying that the real impediments are the amounts offered by the opioid defendants.
"We don't want these companies to go out of business," he said. "But we want them to pay for what they did."

Texto completo: FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. - Jalaiah Harmon is coming up in a dance world completely reshaped by the internet.
She trains in all the traditional ways, taking classes in hip-hop, ballet, lyrical, jazz, tumbling and tap after school at a dance studio near her home in the Atlanta suburbs. She is also building a career online, studying viral dances, collaborating with peers and posting original choreography.
Recently, a sequence of hers turned into one of the most viral dances online: the Renegade.
There's basically nothing bigger right now. Teenagers are doing the dance in the halls of high schools, at pep rallies and across the internet. Lizzo, Kourtney Kardashian, David Dobrik and members of К-pop band Stray Kids have all performed it. Charli D'Amelio, TikTok's biggest homegrown star, with nearly 26 million followers on the platform, has been affectionately deemed the dance's "CEO" for popularizing it.
But the one person who hasn't been able to capitalize on the attention is Jalaiah, the Renegade's 14-year-old creator.
"I was happy when I saw my dance all over," she said. "But I wanted credit for it."
The Viral Dance-iearchy
TikTok, one of the biggest video apps in the world, has become synonymous with dance culture. Yet many of its most popular dances, including the Renegade, Holy Moly Donut Shop, the Mmmxneil and Cookie Shop have come from young black creators on myriad smaller apps.
Most of these dancers identify as Dubsmashers. This means, in essence, that they use the Dubsmash app and other short-form social video apps, like Funimate, Likee and Triller, to document choreography to songs they love. They then post (or cross-post) the videos to Instagram, where they can reach a wider audience. If it's popular there, it's only a matter of time before the dance is co-opted by the TikTok masses.
"TikTok is like a mainstream Dubsmash," said Kayla Nicole Jones, 18, a YouTube star and music artist. "They take from Dubsmash and they run off with the sauce."
Polow da Don, a producer, songwriter and rapper who has worked with Usher and Missy Elliott, said: "Dubsmash catches things at the roots when they're culturally relevant. TikTok is the suburban kids that take things on when it's already the style and bring it to their community."
Though Jalaiah is very much a suburban kid herself - she lives in a picturesque home on a quiet street outside of Atlanta - she is part of the young, cutting-edge dance community online that more mainstream influencers co-opt.
The Renegade dance followed this exact path. On Sept. 25, 2019, Jalaiah came home from school and asked a friend she had met through Instagram, Kaliyah Davis, 12, if she wanted to create a post together. Jalaiah listened to the beats in the song "Lottery" by Atlanta rapper К-Camp and then choreographed a difficult sequence to its chorus, incorporating other viral moves like the wave and the whoa.
She filmed herself and posted it, first to Funimate (where she has more than 1,700 followers) and then to her more than 20,000 followers on Instagram (with a side-by-side shot of Kaliyah and her performing it together).
"I posted on Instagram, and it got about 13,000 views, and people started doing it over and over again," Jalaiah said. In October, a user named @global. jones brought it to TikTok, changing up some of the moves at the end, and the dance spread like wildfire. Before long, Charli D'Amelio had posted a video of herself doing it, as did many other TikTok influencers. None gave Jalaiah credit.
After long days in the ninth grade and between dance classes, Jalaiah tried to get the word out. She hopped in the comments of several videos, asking influencers to tag her. For the most part she was ridiculed or ignored.
She even set up her own TikTok account and created a video of herself in front of a green screen, Googling the question "who created the Renegade dance?" in an attempt to set the record straight. "I was upset," she said. "It wasn't fair."
To be robbed of credit on TikTok is to be robbed of real opportunities. In 2020, virality means income: Creators of popular dances, like the Backpack Kid or Shiggy, often amass large online followings and become influencers themselves. That, in turn, opens the door to brand deals, media opportunities and, most important for Jalaiah, introductions to those in the professional dance and choreography community.
Obtaining credit isn't easy, though. As writer Rebecca Jennings noted in Vox in an article about the online dance world's thorny ethics: "Dances are virtually impossible to legally claim as one's own."
But credit and attention are valuable even without legal ownership. "I think I could have gotten money for it, promos for it; I could have gotten famous off it, get noticed," Jalaiah said. "I don't think any of that stuff has happened for me because no one knows I made the dance."
Scares of the Share Economy
Cross-platform sharing - of dances, of memes, of information - is how things are made on the internet. Popular tweets go viral on Instagram; videos made on Instagram make their way onto YouTube. But in recent years, several large Instagram meme accounts have faced backlash for sharing jokes that went viral without crediting the creator.
TikTok was introduced in the United States only a year and a half ago. Norms, particularly around credit, are still being established. But for Dubsmashers and those in the Instagram dance community, it's common courtesy to tag the handles of dance creators and musicians, and use hashtags to track the evolution of a dance.
It has set up a culture clash between the two influencer communities. "On TikTok they don't give people credit," said Raemoni Johnson, a 15-year-old Dubsmasher. "They just do the video, and they don't tag us." (This acrimony is exacerbated by the fact that TikTok does not make it easy to find the creator of a dance.)
On Jan. 17, tensions boiled over after Barrie Segal, head of content at Dubsmash, posted a series of videos asking Charli D'Amelio to give a dance credit to D1 Nayah, a popular Dubsmash dancer with more than 1 million followers on Instagram, for her Donut Shop dance. TikTok Room, a gossip account on Instagram, picked up the controversy and spurred a sea of comments.
"Why is it so hard to give black creators their credit," said one Instagram commenter, referring to the mostly white TikTokers who have taken dances from Dubsmashers and posted them without credit. "Instead of using dubsmash, use tiktok and then ppl would credit you maybe," a TikToker fan said.
"I'm not an argumentative person on social media - I don't want beef or anything like that," said Jhacari Blunt, an 18-year-old Dubsmasher who has had some of his dances co-opted by TikTokers. "But it's like, we all know where that dance came from."
At this point, if a TikToker doesn't initially know who did a dance, commenters will usually tag the original creator's handle. Charli D'Amelio and other stars have started giving dance credits and tagging creators in their captions.
And the creators who are flooding into TikTok from Instagram and Dubsmash are leading the way by example. "We have 1.7 million followers, and we always give credit whether the person has zero followers or not," said Yoni Wicker, 14, one half of the TheWickeiTwinz. "We know how important it is. That person who made that dance, they might be a fan of ours. Us tagging them makes their day."
Onward and Upward
Stefanie Harmon, Jalaiah's mother, learned the true extent of Jalaiah's online success only recently. "She told me, 'Mommy, I made a dance, and it went viral,' " Harmon said.
"She wasn't kicking and screaming about the fact that she wasn't getting credit," she added, "but I could tell it had affected her. I said, 'Why do you care whether you're not getting credit? Just make another one.' "
Jalaiah continues to post a steady stream of dance videos to Funimate, Dubsmash, and Instagram. She said she doesn't harbor any hard feelings against Charli D'Amelio for popularizing the Renegade without naming her. Instead, she hopes she can collaborate with her one day.
Charli D'Amelio, through a publicist, said that she was "so glad to know" who created the dance. "I know it's so associated with me," she said, "but I'm so happy to give Jalaiah credit and I'd love to collaborate with her."
"We're all inspired by other people," Jalaiah said. "We make up a dance and it grows."
Off the internet, she continues to compete in dance competitions with her studio and hopes to one day take classes at Dance 411, a prestigious dance school in Atlanta. Ultimately, it's the art form that she loves. "It makes me happy to dance," she said.

Texto completo: At a time when American elections are especially polarized and when turnout is at disturbingly low levels, it is sensible to consider changes to how voters choose elected officials.
That brings us to the prospect of ranked-choice voting. The Community Task Force on Council Representation, a group convened last year by the Vancouver City Council, is taking a fresh look at ranked-choice voting for the selection of council members.
With a ranked-choice system, voters mark their ballots not only for their first choice, but also indicate their second and third choices — and perhaps a fourth and fifth, depending upon how the system is configured. The idea is that if a voter's first choice receives little support in the election, their vote will move down to a second choice or beyond.
Proponents say the system helps to reduce the enmity that infects modern politics. As The New York Times wrote last week: “With ranked choice, voters can support outsider candidates without worrying about wasting their ballots. And candidates can win only with support — or at least tolerance — from a majority of the electorate, which can help prevent polarization.”
Washington's election system, with only two candidates advancing to the general election in each race, already avoids that problem. In other states, where minor-party candidates can fracture the vote, general elections can be won with, say, 40 percent of the vote. Proponents say ranked-choice voting would eliminate the need for a primary in council races, but that would create additional problems.
Because of that, it is difficult to see the advantages of ranked-choice voting for the Vancouver City Council. In truth, such a system for a handful of races — while county, state and federal contests retained the current system — would only add confusion that is a turnoff for voters.
That assertion has been confirmed in Washington. In the late 1990s, Vancouver voters approved a ranked-choice voting system, but it was never implemented by the city council because of concerns about legal challenges from the state. In 2006, voters in Pierce County adopted ranked-choice voting; three years later, they repealed it. As state Sen. Hans Zeiger, R-Puyallup, told Crosscut last year: “From my point of view it was a disaster when Pierce County tried ranked-choice voting, and it was not well-designed.”
Two bills in the Legislature would open the door for municipalities to embrace ranked-choice voting. House Bill 1722 attracted 27 co-sponsors — including Democratic Reps. Monica Stonier and Sharon Wylie from Vancouver — but neither bill has made it out of committee. Meanwhile, the system has been adopted in several states throughout the country, and Maine employed it for the 2018 congressional elections.
While the negatives outweigh the positives of ranked-choice voting for the Vancouver City Council, there is room for improvement. Residents in east Vancouver typically are underrepresented on the council, as is the city's growing minority population. That might simply be due to a lack of candidates from those constituencies; if that is the case it reflects poorly on a system that disenfranchises large swaths of the city.
Because of that, choosing at least some council members in district voting — rather than having all positions selected by citywide vote — would be a more effective manner for finding a representative council.
Improving that representation and better engaging with voters is important work for the task force. But it is difficult to see how ranked-choice voting would impr

Ink Rx? Welcome To The Camouflaged World Of Paramedical Tattoos

Texto completo: HECKER, Ill. — The first fingernail tattoo started off as a joke by a man who lost the tips of two fingers in a construction accident in 2018.
But that shifted after Eric Catalano, an auto finance manager turned tattoo artist, finished with his needle.
“The mood changed in here,” Catalano recalled as he stood in his Eternal Ink Tattoo Studio. “Everything turned from funny to wow.”
When Catalano posted a photo of the inked fingernails online last January, he thought maybe 300 people would like the realistic tattoo. He had no idea the image would be viewed by millions of people around the world. Even “Ripley’s Believe It or Not!” tracked him down to feature the viral tattoo: a pair of fingernails that looked so real no one could believe their eyes.
The viral photo pushed Catalano, 39, further into the world of paramedical tattooing. Now people with life-altering scars come from as far as Ireland to visit Catalano’s tattoo shop in this rural village about 30 miles outside St. Louis. They enter Eternal Ink looking for the healing touch they saw online. With flesh-toned ink and a needle, Catalano makes his clients feel whole again with an art form and industry that picks up where doctors leave off.
Catalano is known for his talent with intricate fingernails and filling in the blanks left empty by accidents or surgeries, but other paramedical tattoo artists also are trying out flesh-toned pigments to camouflage imperfections, scars and discolorations for all skin colors.
Using tattoos to blend in rather than stand out is a relatively new field. A school started outside Atlanta about four years ago has trained more than 100 aspiring paramedical tattoo artists.
Because the work is considered cosmetic, though, it typically isn’t covered by medical insurance. Still, the mostly unregulated industry continues to grow even as health care professionals debate the safety of tattoo ink. Many people are willing to pay out-of-pocket for that final piece of healing.
Leslie Pollan, 32, a stay-at-home mom and dog breeder in Oxford, Mississippi, feels this service is priceless. She was bitten on the face by a puppy in 2014. She underwent countless surgeries to correct a scar on her lip.
“I went to plastic surgeons that were supposed to be the best in Memphis,” Pollan said. “They gave me no hope, so I started looking for other options.”
She ultimately traveled six hours for a paramedical tattoo session with Catalano. He used ink and his tattoo needle to camouflage Pollan’s lip scar, giving her back a piece of her confidence.
“You don’t understand until you’ve been through it,” Pollan said. “It really made me have a different outlook on life.”
A Booming Business
More than 500 miles from Catalano’s shop, industry expert and paramedical tattoo trainer Feleshia Sams, 41, shows artists and health professionals how to cover stretch marks, surgery scars and discolored skin with flesh-toned pigment in the course she launched at the Academy of Advanced Cosmetics in Alpharetta, Georgia.
While a tattoo license is required for such work, separate paramedical tattoo training is not.
Catalano is self-taught. He uses the techniques he picked up years ago while helping breast cancer survivors who wanted tattoos of areolas — the dark area around nipples — after having mastectomies. Those tattoos are among the most common paramedical requests.
His grandmother had breast cancer. Her battle with the disease is one reason Catalano is so dedicated to helping those with the diagnosis.
“Cancer took away a part of my body I can never get back,” said Sarah Penberthy, a breast cancer survivor who came from Festus, Missouri, for areola tattoos. “I felt like I wasn’t even human.”
Penberthy, 39, said she was grateful for her life but still felt incomplete until Catalano stepped in. He tattooed nipples and a creative design of a ship’s anchor on her chest that says “I REFUSE TO SINK.”
Catalano now does up to eight reconstructive tattoos each “Wellness Wednesday,” drawing in nail beds on finger amputees and mocking up belly buttons after tummy tucks.
Catalano doesn’t charge for paramedical tattoos. A GoFundMe page established last year brought in more than $12,000, allowing Catalano to donate his skills for the time being.
“Financially it doesn’t make sense, but it’s just something that I love to do,” Catalano said.
But the single father of three will need more to keep things going. He wants to find other ways to fund his work.
Elsewhere, the business of paramedical tattoos is supported by the booming interest in cosmetic and plastic surgery, Sams said. Americans spent more than $16.5 billion on cosmetic procedures in 2018. After tummy tucks, breast augmentations and other procedures, some patients want to cover their scars.
“It’s going to take off even more so than what we’ve seen in the past,” said Sams. “We’re providing students with a nontraditional way to make a career.”
She added that one of her graduates reports a six-figure salary after establishing a business of her own.
Trial-And-Error Tattoos
Catalano’s first fingernail client, Mark Bertram, 46, lost the tips of two fingers at work when his hand became trapped in a fan belt.
“It’s life changing but it’s not life ending,” Bertram said. “Doing work is harder now. Everything is just a little different.”
He can’t tie his shoes with ease, type on a keyboard or hold food the same way anymore. But after two surgeries and occupational therapy, he decided to make light of his new condition by asking Catalano to create the fingernail tattoo. The idea made everyone in the studio laugh until they saw the final result.
Bertram has returned to the shop for a touch-up. The maintenance helps his nails keep their realistic look. The ink in fingernail tattoos, however, doesn’t always absorb into the scar-tissued skin.
The two fingernail tattoos that José Alvarado, 44, of Pingree Grove, Illinois, got from Catalano in November wore off within weeks.
Alvarado had become an amputee 16 years ago when he damaged two fingers on the job at a printing factory. He endured two surgeries after the accident and had decided to visit Catalano’s tattoo studio from his home outside Chicago after seeing the artist’s work online. Although he was upset when the tattoos first wore off, he said, he’d like to try them again because he liked how it looked.
Catalano’s not sure why they work for some and not others.
Getting the same results for people with darker skin tones is also a challenge because the color of their nail beds doesn’t match the color of their skin. And paramedical tattoos of any kind for people of color can be more difficult to execute, which is one reason Sams created a line of 30 skin-colored and undertone pigments for trained professionals that she sells online and at her school . Catalano tracks the ink he uses as he continues to figure things out along the way.
“It may not be a one-size-all thing that fits everybody,” he said.
Catalano still does regular tattoos out of the studio he established more than 10 years ago. His rate of $100 per hour for those tattoos has stayed the same while he donates his paramedical work every Wednesday.
“Every time I see that emotion, I’m 100% sure this is something that I can’t stop doing,” he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser John Bolton raised alarm the Trump administration could block his memoir that describes his interaction with the president over Ukraine.
“I hope it’s not suppressed,” Bolton said Monday at a speech at Duke University in Durham, N.C. “This is an effort to write history, and I did it the best I can. We’ll have to see what comes out of the censorship.”
Bolton added: “I say things in the manuscript about what he said to me,” referring to President Donald Trump.
Bolton said he couldn’t answer a question related to North Korea because it’s also included in his book, which is undergoing pre-publication review by the government. The Trump administration already has raised concern about the manuscript divulging secret information.
The event was Bolton’s first public appearance since Trump’s impeachment trial was roiled over a report in The New York Times that Bolton would publish a memoir alleging that the president explicitly said he wanted to condition security assistance to Ukraine on an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
The report raised pressure on Senate Republicans to call witnesses in the trial and undermined the White House’s claim that Trump never sought a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid to Ukraine. But Trump denied the allegations — tweeting that the news emerged only because Bolton sought “to sell a book” — and Senate Republicans ultimately voted against calling Bolton or other witnesses before voting to acquit the president.
At the event Monday, Bolton was asked whether he agreed with Trump’s characterization of his call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as “perfect.” Bolton responded: “You’ll love Chapter 14.”
But Bolton made clear his book covers more than Ukraine.
“There are portions of the manuscript that deal with Ukraine,” he said. “I view that like the sprinkles on the ice cream sundae, meaning, in terms of what’s in the book.”
Bolton’s manuscript also reportedly alleges that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo privately acknowledged there was little credence to Rudy Giuliani’s claims that former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt. Bolton also reportedly wrote that he told Attorney General William Barr that the president had mentioned him on a call with the Ukrainian president. The Justice Department has denied that Barr knew Trump suggested the Ukrainians coordinate their investigations with the attorney general.
Bolton also reportedly wrote that he told Barr he had concerns Trump had granted personal favors to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Xi Jinping of China.
Bolton’s memoir, “The Room Where It Happened,” is scheduled to be released March 17. But in a letter to Bolton’s lawyer, the National Security Council said the manuscript “appears to contain significant amounts of classified information” and should not be published as written.
Bolton said Monday his intention isn’t to reveal classified material. Instead, he said he sought to tell readers what unfolded and allow them to decide whether it was appropriate.
On other topics, Bolton criticized the administration’s approach to handling nuclear proliferation in North Korea as “a big mistake” and said the U.S. pursuit of leader Kim Jong Un is “doomed to failure.” He also said Trump’s approach toward Iran is too lenient.
Bolton left Trump’s administration in September after repeated disagreements with the president. He had advised Trump against a plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David immediately before he was ousted, and Trump complained Bolton was “holding me back” in a campaign to depose Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
One of Bolton’s deputies, Fiona Hill, testified in the House impeachment inquiry that Bolton had called Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, a “hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up” for his conduct on Trump’s behalf in Ukraine.
Bolton has publicly sparred with Trump since leaving the White House, disputing the president’s claims of success in nuclear negotiations with North Korea and defending former White House chief of staff John Kelly after the president attacked him in tweets.
Bolton, ousted from the White House in September, is scheduled to speak Wednesday, at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
Jacobs reported from Durham and Sink from Washington.

Don’t ignore Bloomberg’s authoritarian tendencies

Texto completo: For a long time the notion of a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy seemed like a Manhattan fancy, a conceit with elite appeal but no mass constituency, a fantasy that the American people are clamoring for a rich person’s idea of centrism.
But with a populist in the White House, a socialist winning primaries, a Democratic electorate desperate for a winning candidate and an establishment desperate for a champion, Bloomberg has become a somewhat more plausible presidential candidate than I imagined even six months back.
So it’s worth pondering exactly what his still highly unlikely nomination might mean.
Inside the Democratic Party, Bloomberg’s ascent would put a sharp brake on the two major post-Obama trends in liberalism: the Great Awokening on race and sex and culture, and the turn against technocracy in economic policymaking.
More than any other contender, his nomination would pull the party back toward where it stood before the rise of Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, and root liberalism once more in professional-class interests and a Washington-Wall Street mindmeld.
These are good reasons to assume that he cannot be the nominee, and excellent reasons for social progressives and socialists alike to want to beat him. The only way they will fail is if Bloomberg succeeds in casting himself as the unusual answer to an unusual incumbent — combining the Democratic fear of a Donald Trump second term, his own reputation for effective management and the promise of spending his fortune to crush Trump into a more compelling electability pitch than the race’s other moderates.
But Democrats considering this sales pitch should be very clear on what a Bloomberg presidency would mean.
Bloomberg does not have Trump’s flagrant vices or his bald disdain for norms and rules and legal niceties. But while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are naked on his Twitter feed, Bloomberg’s imperial instincts, his indifference to limits on his power, are a conspicuous feature of his career.
Trump jokes about running for a third term; Bloomberg actually managed it, bulldozing through the necessary legal changes. Trump tries to bully the FBI and undermine civil liberties; Bloomberg ran New York as a miniature surveillance state.
Trump has cowed the Republican Party with celebrity and bombast; Bloomberg has spent his political career buying organizations and politicians that might otherwise impede him. Trump blusters and bullies the press; Bloomberg literally owns a major media organization. Trump has Putin envy; Bloomberg hearts Xi Jinping.
And the former mayor, unlike the former “Apprentice” star, is ferociously competent, with a worldview very much aligned with the great and good, from D.C. to Silicon Valley — which means that he would have much more room to behave abnormally without facing a resistance movement of activists and journalists and judges.
To choose Bloomberg as the alternative to Trump, then, is to bet that a chaotic, corrupt populist is a graver danger to what remains of the republic than a grimly competent plutocrat with a history of executive overreach.
Those who choose Bloomberg should know what they’re inviting: an exchange of Trumpian black comedy for oligarchy’s velvet fist.

His statement to reporters on Tuesday indicates a multipronged search within the White House for the author of the tell-all book, A Warning, which spoke of a resistance movement within the Trump administration, has been successful.
"I know who it is," Trump said as he boarded a plane at Joint Base Andrews destined for Los Angeles, adding that he could not divulge a name just yet.
"But I know who it is," he added. "We won't get into it. People know it's a fraud. I know who it is, and I know who some of the leakers are."
Earlier in the month, Trump removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the National Security Council, along with his twin brother, after he testified against Trump in the Democrat-led impeachment proceedings in the House last year. National security adviser Robert O’Brien, who denied allegations that the Vindmans had been retaliated against, has cut dozens of NSC positions inherited from the Obama administration.
Over the weekend, it was reported that White House trade adviser Peter Navarro initiated an unofficial investigation into Anonymous, alongside others, including one by National Security Council officials.
Reporters and officials close to the president have attempted to identify “Anonymous” since the unidentified Trump administration official wrote a New York Times opinion piece spoke of an internal "resistance" within the government.
Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, said this week he was told by "a senior government official" that "Anonymous" had been identified as an official working in the White House and would be removed "soon."
In the book A Warning, released in November, Anonymous alleged that a number of White House aides made note of Cabinet members they believed would support using the 25th Amendment to kick Trump out of office.
Anonymous pledged in a Reddit forum late last year to speak out against Trump before the 2020 election "in my own name."

Texto completo: When it comes to Iran, critics claim that reimposed U.S. sanctions have targeted ordinary Iranians, especially by making importing medicine impossible. However, these claims rely on misleading media reports that put their preferred narrative over the truth.
Here’s the background.
On Jan. 30, the Treasury Department announced the completion of initial financial transactions benefiting Iranian medical patients through a humanitarian channel in Switzerland. This channel is known as the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement. The Treasury Department confirmed the completion of initial financial transactions through the new payment mechanism, stating that they provided a "model for facilitating further humanitarian exports to Iran."
This announcement was followed by statements from Iranian officials clearly contradicting the dozens of media reports that have claimed U.S. sanctions “limit medicine exports to Iran” and are therefore “killing Iranians.”
For instance, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi stated that Iran did not recognize such humanitarian channels. He then added, “medicine and foodstuffs were never subject to sanctions in the first place.” Mousavi also said that the aim of this channel was to “create a channel with much publicity.”
Mousavi’s statement is very important for two crucial reasons.
First of all, it confirms what U.S. officials have been saying for a long time, that medicine and food were always exempt from sanctions. Second of all, with a public channel and a mechanism in place, the United States wants to confront fake news and a widespread disinformation campaign in the Western media.
Since President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and despite the fact that the U.S. had repeatedly announced that medicine was exempted from reimposed sanctions, a well-organized and widespread disinformation campaign in the Western media has sought to convince public opinion of the contrary. The aim of this campaign was to make it seem as if sanctions were limiting imports of medicine and thus killing people.
What is significant is that most of these reports have been published in well-known, left-leaning newspapers and media organizations.
Furthermore, these reporters failed to include enough credible reports or provide adequate evidence. Instead of relying on data and evidence, which explains the true causes of the shortage of medicine in Iran, the journalists referenced anonymous sources, interviewed “ordinary Iranians,” or even used the Iranian foreign minister’s tweets in English. He is known for his lying, but they repeat his assertions as fact, nonetheless, peddling the regime’s talking points in the process.
As a result, journalists end up leaving crucial facts out of the story.
For instance, in November 2018, both Nilo Tabrizy of the New York Times and Golnar Motevalli and Ladane Nasseri of Bloomberg News claimed that because of U.S. sanctions, there is a shortage of medicine in Iran. They include some details and nuance, but not nearly enough.
The facts clearly contradict this manufactured media narrative: In February 2019, the president of the Central Bank of Iran published a detailed report, which crucially stated that Iran’s imports of medicine had increased, with well more than $1 billion worth of medicines and medical supplies imported in just six months.
Despite that information, another report was published in Foreign Policy in August 2019, claiming “US sanctions are killing and affecting cancer patients in Iran.” It somehow failed to include crucial information undercutting this narrative, despite it being widely available and published in Iran.
Furthermore, again in July 2019, another journalist wrote a report for the Associated Press, also based on interviews, claiming that “US sanctions [are] blocking access to needed medicine.” However, like other reports peddled in the media, this one also failed to provide adequate evidence to back the claim and instead relied on interviews conducted with individuals.
Again, the U.S. and Iranian governments say the sanctions are not causing medicinal shortages in Iran, and yet journalists are claiming otherwise, basing their stories on anonymous sources and ignoring the hard evidence. In fact, what medicinal shortages do exist are likely the fault of the Iranian government. President Hassan Rouhani, in July 2019, asked three Cabinet members to explain how import companies “lost” a billion euros, with two of the six companies involved being pharmaceutical companies. So it’s Iranian corruption, not U.S. sanctions, that are causing any medicinal shortages.
In essence, it would seem that the aim of establishing the new Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement is to counter the disinformation campaign plaguing some media outlets and spread the truth that food and medicine were never actually sanctioned by the U.S. Perhaps, this time, the media will finally catch on.

Texto completo: Plymouth Rock was vandalized with graffiti overnight on Sunday as locals prepared to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing.
The historic landmark was covered in mostly indecipherable red graffiti, but the number "508" and the phrase "MOF" can be seen in images taken of the vandalism. Police are reviewing surveillance footage and gathering evidence in the surrounding area to find those responsible. Law enforcement also said that graffiti was found at the base of a monument, approximately one mile away from Plymouth Rock, dedicated to the passengers of the Mayflower. Police chief Michael Botieri said that, at both locations, obscene messages were painted on the statues and landmarks, according to local media.
However, residents of the town were shocked at the vandalism of one of the country's oldest commemorative landmarks.
"The Town woke up this morning to the destructive actions of persons unknown who chose to deliberately vandalize some of our historic monuments and landmarks. The defacement of these symbols of Plymouth’s history, or any public property for that matter, is unfathomable and unconscionable," said Town Manager Melissa Arrighi in an online statement. "The Town of Plymouth Police are actively seeking those responsible and will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. Our Public Works crew are already working vigorously to obliterate the graffiti."
Arrighi then thanked volunteers and Plymouth public works crews for their assistance in removing the graffiti, which required chemical cleaning and washing.

According to legend, the Pilgrims disembarked the Mayflower in 1620, first setting foot on Plymouth Rock. Many of the Mayflower's passengers were English Puritan separatists, accused of treason for their doctrinal disagreements with King James. They fled England in part to pursue religious freedom and drafted the Mayflower Compact to govern the Plymouth colony they founded.
The earliest aspects of American history have come under fire in recent years. In 2019, the New York Times launched its 1619 Project, named for the year when African slaves first arrived in Virginia. Attempting to explain U.S. history through the lens of slavery, the project argues that "no aspect of the country that would be formed [in Virginia] has been untouched by the years of slavery that followed."iFrame Object

Wife of reporter says Bloomberg tried to ‘ruin’ family after she spoke out against China

Texto completo: The wife of a former Bloomberg News reporter claimed Michael Bloomberg threatened to “ruin” her family to protect his company’s ties to China.
Leta Hong Fincher, whose husband, Michael Forsythe, now writes for the New York Times, accused the former New York City mayor of trying to ruin her family financially after she revealed that they had been threatened by Chinese authorities over negative coverage about Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping.
In an editorial for the Intercept, Fincher explained that Forsythe had written a story for Bloomberg News in June 2012 that described how Xi’s family became incredibly wealthy when he took over party leadership. After that story was published, Fincher received threats against her young children, who were 6 and 8 years old at the time. Bloomberg News urged the family not to speak out about the threats.
Fincher stayed quiet until October 2012, when a separate story in the New York Times revealed that other reporters had been threatened. She tweeted, “Now that NYT has gone public about Chinese govt pressure, I can admit that we got death threats after Bloomberg story on Xi Jinping.”
Bloomberg News demanded that Fincher pull the tweets down. She refused but agreed to stop discussing the issue online. In 2013, Forsythe had been working on a story similar to the story about Xi’s family raking in cash. Just before the story was set to publish, Bloomberg knifed the story over fears that they would be “kicked out of China.”
Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York City at the time, denied that he had killed the story, saying, “Nobody thinks that we’re wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct.”
Shortly after he made those remarks, Fincher and Forsythe were ordered to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Fincher wrote, “Bloomberg lawyers in Hong Kong threatened to devastate my family financially by forcing us to repay the company for our relocation fees to Hong Kong from Beijing and the advance on my husband’s salary that we took out, leave us with no health insurance or income, and take me to court if I did not sign a nondisclosure agreement — even though I had never been a Bloomberg employee.”
Fincher claimed that Bloomberg’s attorney was going to demand that they pay thousands of dollars to the company, including his legal fees, if she didn’t sign the agreement, despite not being an employee of the company. She hired the same attorneys who defended Edward Snowden to help her with the case, which Bloomberg eventually dropped.
“My story shows the lengths that the Bloomberg machine will go to in order to avoid offending Beijing,” Fincher wrote. “Bloomberg’s company, Bloomberg LP, is so dependent on the vast China market for its business that its lawyers threatened to devastate my family financially if I didn’t sign an NDA silencing me about how Bloomberg News killed a story critical of Chinese Communist Party leaders.”
Fincher noted that she believed there were many similar stories out there against Bloomberg that have been silenced by nondisclosure agreements.
“I haven’t met any of the other women [bound by disclosures], but I imagine that they, too, may have experienced the same terror of being threatened by a multibillion-dollar corporation, which could ruin their lives if they did not comply,” Fincher wrote. “Even now, I am nervous about the consequences of speaking out. But the more of us speak out, the stronger we are.”
The billionaire has been known to meddle in the newsroom owned by his company, Bloomberg LP. When he announced his presidential bid, Bloomberg News announced that it would continue its policy of not investigating Bloomberg or his finances. Instead, it decided to halt all investigations into 2020 Democrats but agreed to continue digging into the Trump administration and campaign.
Bloomberg, 78, surged into second place in a recent national poll, trailing only Sen. Bernie Sanders. The billionaire’s strong showing in the poll also qualified him for his first debate appearance on Wednesday in Nevada.

Texto completo: Madrid • I’m in Spain right now, talking about zombie ideas — ideas that should have been killed by evidence, but just keep lurching along. In the modern United States, most important zombie ideas are on the right, kept undead by big money from billionaires who have a financial interest in getting people to believe things that aren’t true.
But sometimes zombie ideas also manage to eat centrists’ brains. Sure enough, some of the most destructive zombies of the past dozen years have shambled their way into the Democratic primary fight, where a couple of centrists are repeating ideas that were thoroughly debunked years ago.
And as it happens, the experience of Europe, and Spain in particular, provides some of the bullets we should be using to shoot these particular zombies in the head.
So let’s start with the origins of the 2008 financial crisis, a topic that remains relevant if we want to avoid repeating past mistakes.
Although few saw 2008 coming, in retrospect it was a classic banking panic, the type of thing that happened frequently before the 1930s. First, lenders got caught up in a gigantic housing bubble; then, when the bubble burst, much of the financial system just froze up.
What made this panic possible, after two generations of relative financial calm? The answer, clearly, was the erosion of effective financial regulation over the previous few decades.
But right-wingers refused to accept the obvious. Instead, they pushed an alternative narrative in which liberals somehow caused the crisis by forcing poor innocent bankers to lend money to people of color (they weren’t usually that explicit, but that was the clear message). This narrative was so nakedly self-serving that it’s hard to believe that anyone took it seriously; but some influential people bought it. And among those people was Michael Bloomberg.
At this point the evidence against the liberals-did-it story is overwhelming. The surge in bad loans came neither from government-sponsored agencies nor from regulated banks, but from unregulated mortgage originators. The fallout was so severe because investors believed, wrongly, that fancy financial instruments protected them from risk.
And, crucially, the housing bubble was an international phenomenon: Spain had a bigger bubble than we did, followed by a worse slump. Did U.S. liberals force Spanish banks to make bad loans?
But zombie ideas can’t be killed by evidence. Perpetrators of the liberals-did-it lie are still out there, still getting space to spread their disinformation in mainstream media.
Elizabeth Warren argues that Bloomberg’s embrace of a false right-wing narrative about the financial crisis should disqualify him for the Democratic nomination. But I’d be willing to cut him some slack if he’d admit that he was taken in by right-wing disinformation. If he isn’t willing to make that admission, she’s right.
At the same time that Bloomberg is being called out on his housing bubble zombie, Pete Buttigieg is facing justified criticism for buying into another zombie idea — the obsession with government debt. That obsession did much to hobble recovery from the financial crisis.
To be fair, deficit panic wasn’t as naked a scam as the claim that do-gooders caused the financial crisis, although some of the loudest voices decrying the evils of deficits were obvious phonies. What happened instead was that many important people imagined that inveighing against the dangers of debt made them sound serious, because that’s what all the other serious people were doing.
At this point, however, the debt obsession has been thoroughly debunked by both economic research and experience. We live in a world awash in private savings looking for someplace to go, with investors willing to lend money to governments at incredibly low interest rates. It’s actually irresponsible not to put this money to work investing in the future, both by building physical infrastructure and through programs that help children develop their potential.
Now, the Trump administration is doing it wrong — borrowing large sums, but squandering the money on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. But even bad deficit spending boosts the economy to some extent, and it is the reason America is still growing reasonably fast while Europe, still in the grip of austerity ideology, is stagnating.
Look: It’s easy to make the political case that Democrats should nominate a centrist, rather than someone from the party’s left wing. Candidates who are perceived as ideologically extreme usually pay an electoral penalty; this is especially true if, like Bernie Sanders, they actually pose as more radical than they really are.
But a key part of centrism’s appeal is the belief that centrists are realists, who understand how the world works. It’s much harder to make the case for centrists who repeat manifestly false claims, especially if those claims were essentially right-wing propaganda.
As I said, you can make a good case for the proposition that Democrats should, in the end, nominate a centrist. But a centrist whose brain has been eaten by zombie ideas? Not so much.

Texto completo: People have a tragic flaw: Sometimes we want others to do the thinking for us. And across the ages promoters and con men have been more than willing to oblige. They invite us to indulge in the fantasy that a newfound father figure will fix it all, though it never works out that way.
This is the premise of a prescient book from 1841, “Extraordinary Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,” by the Scottish journalist Charles MacKay, which documents in extensive detail the moments when entire societies have set aside their own good judgment under the spell of a charlatan.
We are in one of those moments today.
President Trump’s abandonment of fiscal responsibility will prove disastrous — whether we think about it or not. His State of the Union address underscored his own thinking; it was long on pander and did not address our country’s bleak financial state.
Yet amazingly, conservatives whom I have long respected somehow look the other way.
What if it were President Barack Obama allowing the national debt to grow by a trillion dollars a year, despite the booming economy? What if other Republican presidents had abandoned the idea of trying to get to a balanced budget over the next 10 years? We would hear howls of protest. But now? Crickets.
This is a mistake. What is accumulating is deadly: Bad finances kill countries. There is no bigger issue.
And so while the president’s State of the Union was certainly a made-for-TV moment, with a proverbial “chicken for every conservative pot,” his time in office has left out the main ingredient of what conservatism used to be based on — how big is government, and are we paying for the government we own? He didn’t even mention our country’s looming debt and deficits in the speech. Not once.
Milton Friedman said years ago that the ultimate measure of government was what it spent. By this account the administration has been a gut-wrenching failure.
The administration’s neglect of our nation’s financial health long precedes the president’s address. In 2017, when I was still a member of the House Budget Committee, I clashed with Mick Mulvaney, who was then the acting budget director, over the administration’s optimistic budget assumptions.
I said, flat out, that the budget was a lie. Its numbers could never materialize because it was wishful thinking. And time proved me right.
Some of my conservative friends, when I criticize the president, respond that a President Sanders would be even worse for the deficit. True — but that makes it all the more important for those of us on the right to vigorously challenge the president’s reckless financial path. If the left has abandoned all sense of fiscal discipline, we have to be the ones to talk numbers that most seem to have somehow forgotten.
Here are three things to ponder for those of us who believe in math, markets and sustaining the American dream.
First, despite the president’s words, financially we have never been as vulnerable as a country since the Great Depression and World War II. We have never run deficits this big in peacetime. What happens to them when the economy cools?
Even today, with low interest rates, the fastest-growing spending item for the federal government is interest on the national debt. Over the next 10 years, we are projected to move from spending about $400 billion in interest a year to about $1 trillion. That could amount to over $7 trillion in interest payments.
Second, such persistent debt will have enormous consequences for national security — it always does. The historian Paul Kennedy, in his book “The Rise and Fall of Great Powers,” argues that military might without healthy budgets to back it up leads to a hollow force, good on paper but unprepared to fight. I agree. We should all be worried by the fact that we will soon be spending more on interest than on our military.
We should also worry that foreign ownership of our debt has risen to 40 percent. If foreign ownership of one’s debt were the road to military or economic strength, then Zimbabwe and Argentina would be world powers.
Finally, our growing debt makes the American dream more elusive, and in doing so weakens us all. A trillion-dollar deficit is nothing more than a deferred tax bill for $1 trillion. For a country that was in part founded on the notion of no taxation without representation, how does this pilfering of future generations’ wealth possibly make sense? Our children, and their children, will have fewer and fewer life choices and chances, thanks to our profligate spending.
Too many fellow conservatives, and the Republican Party at large, have chosen to ignore this mounting crisis out of fealty to President Trump. If Charles MacKay were alive today, he would add another chapter to his book, about today’s financial amnesia.
It’s a mistake that each one of us must work to correct, because it’s our future that hangs in the balance.

Texto completo: For a long time the notion of a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy seemed like a Manhattan fancy, a conceit with elite appeal but no mass constituency, a fantasy for Acela riders who imagine that the American people are clamoring for a rich person’s idea of centrism.
This was especially true in the days when Bloomberg would advertise his interest in a third-party candidacy. Third parties are generally founded on ideas that elites are neglecting, like the combination of economic populism, social conservatism and America-first foreign policy that propelled Donald Trump to power. Whereas Bloombergism is elite thinking perfectly distilled: social liberalism and technocracy, hawkish internationalism and business-friendly environmentalism, plus a dose of authoritarianism to make the streets safe for gentrification.
But with a populist in the White House, a socialist winning primaries, a Democratic electorate desperate for a winning candidate and an establishment desperate for a champion, Bloomberg has become a somewhat more plausible presidential candidate than I imagined even six months back. So it’s worth pondering exactly what his still highly unlikely but not entirely unimaginable nomination might mean, and what he offers as an alternative to both his Democratic rivals and to Donald Trump.
Inside the Democratic Party, Bloomberg’s ascent would put a sharp brake on the two major post-Obama trends in liberalism: the Great Awokening on race and sex and culture, and the turn against technocracy in economic policymaking.
Yes, Bloomberg has adapted his policy views to better fit the current liberal consensus, and his views on social issues were liberal to begin with. But he has the record of a deficit and foreign policy hawk, the soul of a Wall Street centrist, and a history of racial and religious profiling and sexist misbehavior. More than any other contender, his nomination would pull the party back toward where it stood before the rise of Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, and root liberalism once more in professional-class interests and a Washington-Wall Street mindmeld.
These are good reasons to assume that he cannot be the nominee, and excellent reasons for social progressives and socialists alike to want to beat him. The only way they will fail is if Bloomberg succeeds in casting himself as the unusual answer to an unusual incumbent — combining the Democratic fear of a Trump second term, his own reputation for effective management and the promise of spending his fortune to crush Trump into a more compelling electability pitch than the race’s other moderates.
But Democrats considering this sales pitch should be very clear on what a Bloomberg presidency would mean. Bloomberg does not have Trump’s flagrant vices (though some of his alleged behavior with women is pretty bad) or his bald disdain for norms and rules and legal niceties, so a Bloomberg presidency would feel less institutionally threatening, less constitutionally perilous, than the ongoing wildness of the Trump era — in addition to delivering at least some of the policy changes that liberals and Democrats desire.
However, feelings can be deceiving. Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are naked on his Twitter feed, but Bloomberg’s imperial instincts, his indifference to limits on his power, are a conspicuous feature of his career. Trump jokes about running for a third term; Bloomberg actually managed it, bulldozing through the necessary legal changes. Trump tries to bully the FBI and undermine civil liberties; Bloomberg ran New York as a miniature surveillance state. Trump has cowed the Republican Party with celebrity and bombast; Bloomberg has spent his political career buying organizations and politicians that might otherwise impede him. Trump blusters and bullies the press; Bloomberg literally owns a major media organization. Trump has Putin envy; Bloomberg hearts Xi Jinping.
In our era of congressional abdication, all presidents are prodded or tempted toward power grabs and Caesarism. But Bloomberg’s career, no less than Trump’s, suggests that as president this would be less a temptation than a default approach. And the former mayor, unlike the former “Apprentice” star, is ferociously competent, with a worldview very much aligned with the great and good, from D.C. to Silicon Valley — which means that he would have much more room to behave abnormally without facing a resistance movement of activists and journalists and judges.
To choose Bloomberg as the alternative to Trump, then, is to bet that a chaotic, corrupt populist is a graver danger to what remains of the republic than a grimly competent plutocrat with a history of executive overreach and strong natural support in all our major power centers.
That seems like a very unwise bet. Democrats who want to leverage Trump’s unpopularity to move the country leftward should support Bernie Sanders. Democrats who prefer a return-to-normalcy campaign should unite behind a normal politician like Amy Klobuchar. Those who choose Bloomberg should know what they’re inviting: an exchange of Trumpian black comedy for oligarchy’s velvet fist.

Elizabeth Rosenthal: Who is profiting from your outrageous medical bills?

Texto completo: Every politician condemns the phenomenon of “surprise” medical bills. This week, two committees in the House are marking up new surprise billing legislation. One of the few policy proposals President Trump brought up in this year’s State of the Union address was his 2019 executive order targeting them. In the Democratic debates, candidates have railed against such medical bills, and during commercial breaks, back-to-back ads from groups representing doctors and insurers proclaimed how much the health care sector also abhors this uniquely American form of patient extortion.
Patients, of course, hate surprise bills most of all. Typical scenarios: A patient having a heart attack is taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital and gets hit with a bill of over $100,000 because that hospital wasn’t in his insurance network. A patient selects an in-network provider for a minor procedure, like a colonoscopy, only to be billed thousands for the out-of-network anesthesiologist and pathologist who participated.
And yet, no one with authority in Washington has done much of anything about it.
Here’s why: Major sectors of the health industry have helped to invent this toxic phenomenon, and none of them want to solve it if it means their particular income stream takes a hit. And they have allies in the capital.
That explains why President Trump’s executive order, issued last year, hasn’t resulted in real change. Why bipartisan congressional legislation supported by both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Health Committee to shield Americans from surprise medical bills has gone nowhere. And why surprise billing provisions were left out of the end-of-year spending bill in December, which did include major tax relief for many parts of the health care industry.
Surprise bills are just the latest weapons in a decades-long war between the players in the health care industry over who gets to keep the fortunes generated each year from patient illness — $3.6 trillion in 2018.
Here’s how they came to be:
Forty years ago, when many insurers were nonprofit entities and being a doctor wasn’t seen as a particularly good entree into the 1 percent, billed rates were far lower than they are today, and insurers mostly just paid them. Premiums were low or paid by an employer. Patients paid little or nothing in co-payments or deductibles.
That’s when a more entrepreneurial streak kicked in. Think about the opportunities: If someone is paying you whatever you ask, why not ask for more?
Commercial insurers as well as Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans, some of which had converted to for-profit status by 2000, began to push back on escalating fees from providers, demanding discounts.
Hospitals and doctors argued about who got to keep different streams of revenue they were paid. Doctors began to form their own companies and built their own outpatient surgery centers to capture payments for themselves.
So today your hospital and doctor and insurer — all claiming to coordinate care for your health — are often in a three-way competition for your money.
As the battle for revenue has heated up, each side has added new weapons to capture more: Hospitals added facility fees and infusion charges. Insurers levied ever-rising co-payments and deductibles. Most important they limited the networks of providers to those that would accept the rates they were willing to pay.
Surprise bills are the latest tactic: When providers decided that an insurer’s contracted payment offerings were too meager, they stopped participating in the insurer’s network; either they walked away or the insurer left them out. In some cases, physicians decided not to participate in any networks at all. That way, they could charge whatever they wanted when they got involved in patient care and bill the patient directly. For their part, insurers didn’t really care if those practitioners demanding more money left.
And, for a time, all sides were basically fine with this arrangement.
But as the scope and the scale of surprise bills has grown in the past five years, more people have experienced these costly, unpleasant surprises. With accumulating bad publicity, they have became impossible to ignore. It was hard to defend a patient stuck with over $500,000 in surprise bills for 14 weeks of dialysis. Or the $10,000 bill from the out-of-network pediatrician who tends to newborns in intensive care. How about the counties where no ambulance companies participate in insurance, so every ambulance ride costs hundreds or even thousands of dollars?
These practices are an obvious outrage. But no one in the health care sector wants to unilaterally make the type of big concessions that would change them. Insurers want to pay a fixed rate. Doctors and hospitals prefer what they call “baseball- style arbitration,” where a reasonable charge is determined by mediation. Both camps have lined up sympathetic politicians for their point of view.
So, nothing has changed at the federal level, even though it’s hard to imagine another issue for which there is such widespread consensus. Two-thirds of Americans say they are worried about being able to afford an unexpected medical bill — more than any other household expense. Nearly eight in 10 Americans say they want federal legislation to protect patients against surprise bills.
States are passing their own surprise billing laws, though they lack power since much of insurance is regulated at a national level.
Now members of Congress have yet another chance to tackle this obvious injustice. Will they listen to hospitals, doctors, insurers? Or, in this election year, will they finally heed their voter-patients?

Texto completo: China’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has imperiled itself and the world because it is a land of 21st-century science and 19th-century politics.
Scholars in China predicted a year ago in an article in the journal Viruses that it was “highly likely” that there would be coronavirus outbreaks, calling it an “urgent issue.” Once the outbreak occurred, other Chinese scientists rapidly identified the virus and sequenced its DNA, posting it on Jan. 10 on a virology website for all to see. That was extraordinarily good and fast work.
Meanwhile, the Communist Party instinctively organized a cover-up, ordering the police to crack down on eight doctors accused of trying to alert others to the risks. National television programs repeatedly denounced the doctors as rumormongers.
One of those eight doctors, Li Wenliang, caught the virus and died — causing public outrage. Some Chinese make the point that if Li had been in charge of China, rather than President Xi Jinping, many lives might have been saved.
“The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance,” a law professor in Beijing, Xu Zhangrun, wrote this month in an online essay that was immediately banned. “The level of popular fury is volcanic, and a people thus enraged may, in the end, also cast aside their fear.”
Xu certainly cast aside his own fear, predicting that he would face new punishments, but adding, “I cannot remain silent.”
He called on his fellow Chinese citizens to demand free speech and free elections and urged: “Rage against injustice; let your lives burn with a flame of decency; break through stultifying darkness and welcome the dawn.”
Xu is now incommunicado, but it is remarkable to see the groundswell of anger online toward the dictatorship. Citizens can’t denounce Xi by name, but they are skilled in evading censors — such as by substituting President Donald Trump’s name for Xi’s.
It’s difficult to know where this goes, but this incongruity between 21st-century science and 19th-century politics is what a Marxist might call a contradiction. This creates long-term challenges that are growing with a swelling middle class (now larger than America’s) that is impatient with the corrupt, thuggish and narcissistic leadership.
Ordinary Chinese see through government propaganda and realize that the mishandling of the coronavirus is only one example of the regime’s ineptitude. Xi’s government also mishandled a swine fever outbreak that began in 2018 and has now killed almost one-quarter of the world’s pigs.
Earlier, China fumbled SARS. And at the beginning of the 2000s, it covered up an AIDS outbreak spread by government-backed blood collection efforts. Vast numbers of impoverished farmers and workers died, for the government response was not to help those infected but to punish doctor whistleblowers. I will never forget a woman then who tried to give me her 4-year-old son because she was dying of AIDS and her husband had already died.
Granted, we Americans must have some humility in critiquing the regime, for it’s a tribute to China’s progress that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer official life expectancy (82 years) than a baby born in Washington, D.C. (78), or New York City (81).
Still, the progress came from China’s technocrats, doctors and scientists, the result in part of opening one new university a week for years. The peak of that technocratic, pragmatic approach came under Prime Minister Zhu Rongji in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
More recently, Xi has tugged China backward, stifling social media and journalism while cultivating something approaching a North Korea-style personality cult around himself. Xi’s propaganda apparatus extols him for personally directing the efforts against the virus and claims that the World Health Organization sent experts to learn from China’s wise handling of the coronavirus.
China’s economic and educational success has created a savvy middle class that feels betrayed when the government spouts nonsense and targets doctors rather than a coronavirus. Doctors on the front line are working almost around the clock with limited supplies, taping up masks, using goggles made of plastic folders, and eating only one meal a day or wearing diapers so as to go to the bathroom less often (for that means removing protective clothing that can’t be replaced).
So far, more than 1,700 medical workers have been infected and at least six have died.
The contrast between heroic doctors and bumbling political leaders could not be more stark.
It’s thus strange to find Trump repeating Xi’s talking points: “I spoke with President Xi,” Trump said, “and they’re working very, very hard, and I think it’s going to all work out fine.”
Xu’s take is harsher, and his essay is reverberating around China through surreptitious copies. “Faced with this virus, the Leader has flailed about,” Xu wrote. “Although everyone looks to The One for the nod of approval, The One himself is clueless.”
“Regardless of how good they are at controlling the internet,” Xu added, “they can’t keep all 1.4 billion mouths in China shut.”

Mark Turcotte is a married father of two and lifelong New Englander. Most of his material is mined from his family life, an adult-like curiosity, and a series of misfortunes. He’s the founder of Maine Event Comedy and was a finalist in the Funniest Comic on the East Coast Contest at Mohegan Sun and a semi-finalist at the World Series of Comedy in Sarasota, Florida. He was also part of the Gotham All-Stars Show in New York City and was a recent selection for the Boston, Cleveland, and North Carolina comedy festivals.

He’s performed at the Dallas Comedy Festival and the San Francisco Comedy Festival.
Leonard Kimble (host) is an up and coming comedian from Auburn, where he lives with his wife, two kids, and a cat he doesn’t want. He spends his days as that IT guy who works on stuff you don’t really care about. Originally from Chicago, Leonard bases his comedy on things he has said to his wife in the car, whether it be about their kids or life in Maine. The sound of strangers laughing at something silly that he wrote in his basement fuels him to his next gig.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The University of Maine at Farmington’s Visiting Writers Series will host a reading with author Jaed Coffin. Coffin will read from his work at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 27, in The Landing in the Olsen Student Center. Sponsored by the UMF Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program, the series events are free and open to the public.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-14985990" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/Coffin-UMF-022720-300x252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" />
Coffin is the author of “Roughhouse Friday” (FSG), a memoir about the year he won the middleweight title of a barroom boxing show in Juneau, Alaska. According to a starred review by Publishers Weekly, “In measured, lucid prose, Coffin writes of fight night scenes and of the insecurity of angry young men. . .This is a powerful, wonderfully written exploration of one’s sense of manhood.” He’s also the author of “A Chant to Soothe Wild Elephants” (Da Capo), which chronicles the summer he spent as a Buddhist monk in his mother’s village in Thailand. A regular contributor to Down East Magazine, Coffin’s essays and stories have appeared in the New York Times, Nautilus, The Sun, and he’s been a storyteller for the Moth Radio Hour and TEDxPortsmouth. He teaches creative writing at the University of New Hampshire and lives in Maine with his wife and two daughters.
As the only Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program in the state of Maine and one of only three in all of New England, the UMF program invites students to work with faculty, who are practicing writers, in workshop-style classes to discover and develop their writing strengths in the genres of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. Small classes, an emphasis on individual conferencing, and the development of a writing portfolio allow students to see themselves as artists and refine their writing under the guidance of accomplished and published faculty mentors. Students can pursue internships to gain real-world writing and publishing experience by working on campus with The Beloit Poetry Journal, a distinguished poetry publication since 1950; or Alice James Books, an award-winning poetry publishing house.

As China battles virus, Dayton companies hope to resume work

Texto completo: The impact of the new coronavirus in China is forcing some Dayton-area companies with Chinese connections to navigate financial and operational challenges.
The virus has killed 1,873, and health officials say half of China’s 1.3 billion population remain subject to varying forms of travel restrictions and other quarantine measures.
The epidemic may cause the global economy to shrink this quarter for the first time since the 2009 recession, according to Capital Economics in London.
The president of Preble County’s Henny Penny said his company’s food equipment manufacturing operation in Suzhou, China is slowly resuming production. Other Dayton-area companies are weathering fast-paced changes in a country where 20 percent of the world’s manufacturing is based.
About 35 of Henny Penny’s 60 Chinese manufacturing workers have been able to return to work so far, said Steve Maggard, president of Eaton-based Henny Penny.
“Last Tuesday, our first people were able to come back,” Maggard told the Dayton Daily News.
In an industrial park that serves as home to some 3,000 companies, Henny Penny’s relatively small Chinese operation is approximately the 600th that has been permitted to resume work, Maggard said.
His hope is that by March 1, Henny Penny’s operation there will once again be fully staffed. Henny Penny’s workforce in Suzhou consists of about 15 office workers and about 45 production workers.
Chinese authorities are implementing stringent rules as work resumes: Employees have their temperatures taken at the start and end of each work day, Maggard said. No outside vendors, guests or visitors are allowed inside a workplace. Face-masks are being worn, and disinfections are a regular part of the work day.
“It’s just very structured and rigid,” Maggard said. “You have to control any outside influence that could come into the facility.”
That’s challenging in a city that is home to more than 10 million people, he said.
Workers must be cleared and quarantined to be able to return to their jobs if they are not from the area or province where they are working, Maggard said, adding that the company’s own general manager in the region has had to spend two weeks in Shanghai because he does not hail from Suzhou.
Henny Penny’s biggest customers in China include McDonald’s and KFC, restaurant chains that are wrestling with their own operational challenges tied to the virus. And many customers are simply staying home, not going out to eat, which is also impacting business.
“While we don’t know the long-term effects of what that means, it’s clearly going to have some impact, at least in the first quarter and probably into the second quarter of the year on our volume,” Maggard said.
Chris Riegel, founder and chief executive of Dayton-based digital signage and technology company Stratacache, thinks the impact may well be deeper.
“This will materially impact probably most global companies into the second quarter and probably into the third quarter,” Riegel said.
However, much of the Chinese nation was celebrating the Chinese New Year from late January until early February — so many facilities were closed anyway, mitigating the impact somewhat, Maggard said.
“They take like two weeks off anyway,” he said. He estimates that perhaps a week of Henny Penny production in China has been lost.
Stratacache has about 250 production workers in China, with about 50 design and technical workers.
“China still remains shut down effectively,” Riegel said. “Each week, we get communication from the government that pushes it back another week.”
However, he believes the situation is starting to improve. “I think in the next two weeks you’ll see them start to come back down.”
Riegel said China is experiencing what he called a manufacturing “cascade effect.” Steel production is affected, which affects further manufacturers downstream, sheet metal companies, automotive producers and others.
“We’re optimistically hoping that the Chinese authorities can put this in control in the coming weeks,” Riegel said. “But we’re cautious.”

If this is not a one-time event, it could become “much more of a strategic problem,” he added.
Asked about shifting his supply chain outside China, Riegel said many companies have done that or are starting to do that anyway due to the recent trade war. But that can go only so far, he added.
“For the industry we are in, there are a lot of things you can’t do competitively outside of China,” he said.
He does expect Chinese authorities to improve the business environment there.
Auto glass producer Fuyao Group is based in China. Leaders of Fuyao Glass America in Moraine say they are monitoring the situation. On Tuesday, the company said none of its employees have been directly affected, as none have traveled to Wuhan, China recently.
The company has about 2,300 workers in Moraine. Globally, Fuyao Glass has more than 25,000 employees.
Last week, Caterpillar said most of its Chinese suppliers have returned to work.
Huffy has much if not nearly all of its bicycle manufacturing anchored in China. Spokespeople for Huffy, which is based in Miami Twp., did not respond to a message seeking comment in time for publication.
Apple has acknowledged that its supply of iPhones will be limited because production was ramping up more slowly than expected.
“Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the New York Times quoted Apple as saying.
China’s National Health Commission reported 1,886 new confirmed coronavirus cases in mainland China Monday, the first time the daily tally has fallen below 2,000 since the beginning of the month, the Wall Street Journal reported.

DHS defiende envío de agentes especiales para ayudar a ICE: “Necesitamos ir con muchos, muchos oficiales”

Texto completo: Al considerar que los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) están sobrecargados en su labor en ciudades santuario , el secretario interino de Seguridad Nacional, Chad Wolf , justificó el envío de fuerzas especiales de Aduanas y Control Fronterizo ( CBP ) para buscar a inmigrantes indocumentados.
Argumentó que la falta de apoyo de las policías locales en condados, ciudades y entidades que tienen políticas de protección a inmigrantes ha vuelto más complicada la labor de los agentes migratorios, lo que requiere enviar “más oficiales”.
“Entonces, se solía envía a uno o dos oficiales a una cárcel a recoger a una persona que estaba con una orden final de expulsión, (pero) ahora tenemos que ir a comunidades con muchos, muchos oficiales, por lo que necesitamos recursos adicionales” , argumentó. “Y eso es lo que está haciendo CBP. Al igual que ICE ayudó a CBP en la frontera suroeste el año pasado cuando estábamos en medio de nuestra crisis, CBP ahora también está ayudando a ICE en sus tareas de aplicación de la ley y de inmigración”.
Wolf reveló lo anterior en una entrevista en Fox News, donde se le cuestionó que los nuevos operativos serían “en lugares sorpresa”, debido a que no habría coordinación con autoridades locales.
“Correcto, porque no nos ayudan. Una vez más, en estas ciudades santuario, no proporcionan recursos para ayudarnos a cumplir nuestra misión” , justificó. “Si decidieran honrar a los detenidos y ayudar a ICE, no tendríamos que recurrir a estos recursos adicionales”.
The New York Times reveló la semana pasada el plan del DHS para enviar oficiales con entrenamiento especial al menos a 11 ciudades santuarios. A partir finales de febrero a mayo, se verán operativos con estos oficiales en Nueva York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Ángeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Nueva Orleans, Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey), que son algunas de las 20 zonas metropolitanas con más indocumentados en el país .
El director interino de ICE, Matthew Albence , argumentó que este paso era necesario ante el riesgo que corren los agentes migratorios durante operativos.
“Los hombres y mujeres dedicados de ICE continuarán haciendo su trabajo independientemente de los obstáculos que se les presenten” , dijo Albence en entrevista también en Fox News. “Pero estas cosas, como las ciudades santuario… ponen a nuestros oficiales en un riesgo mucho mayor de lo que deberían ser”.
Las primeras dos ciudades donde se verían estos despliegues son Nueva York y Chicago, donde grupos defensores de inmigrantes están alertando a los indocumentados a mantenerse informados, además de acusar al DHS de propagar miedo entre la comunidad.
“La reciente decisión del presidente Trump de desplegar a los ‘agentes tácticos de élite’ de la Patrulla Fronteriza en ‘santuarios’ de localidades como Chicago es inhumana y amenaza la seguridad de todos los estadounidenses” , advirtió la Coalición Empresarial Americana de Inmigración. “Los datos muestran constantemente que la delincuencia es menor y las economías son más fuertes en las jurisdicciones ‘santuario'”.
La organización cita que líderes bipartidistas en Illinois, incluido el sheriff republicano Mark Curran y el sheriff demócrata Tom Dart , apoyaron la Ley de Confianza para limitar la cooperación entre ICE y la Policía local. Es
“La inmigración es un problema federal que requiere una solución federal”, adelantaron. “La seguridad es un problema local de aplicación de la ley. Mezclar ambos sólo crea nuevos problemas que podrían poner en peligro la seguridad de los ciudadanos”.

“Entonces, se solía envía a uno o dos oficiales a una cárcel a recoger a una persona que estaba con una orden final de expulsión, (pero) ahora tenemos que ir a comunidades con muchos, muchos oficiales, por lo que necesitamos recursos adicionales” , argumentó. “Y eso es lo que está haciendo CBP. Al igual que ICE ayudó a CBP en la frontera suroeste el año pasado cuando estábamos en medio de nuestra crisis, CBP ahora también está ayudando a ICE en sus tareas de aplicación de la ley y de inmigración”.
Wolf reveló lo anterior en una entrevista en Fox News, donde se le cuestionó que los nuevos operativos serían “en lugares sorpresa”, debido a que no habría coordinación con autoridades locales.
“Correcto, porque no nos ayudan. Una vez más, en estas ciudades santuario, no proporcionan recursos para ayudarnos a cumplir nuestra misión” , justificó. “Si decidieran honrar a los detenidos y ayudar a ICE, no tendríamos que recurrir a estos recursos adicionales”.
The New York Times reveló la semana pasada el plan del DHS para enviar oficiales con entrenamiento especial al menos a 11 ciudades santuarios. A partir finales de febrero a mayo, se verán operativos con estos oficiales en Nueva York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Ángeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Nueva Orleans, Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey), que son algunas de las 20 zonas metropolitanas con más indocumentados en el país .
El director interino de ICE, Matthew Albence , argumentó que este paso era necesario ante el riesgo que corren los agentes migratorios durante operativos.
“Los hombres y mujeres dedicados de ICE continuarán haciendo su trabajo independientemente de los obstáculos que se les presenten” , dijo Albence en entrevista también en Fox News. “Pero estas cosas, como las ciudades santuario… ponen a nuestros oficiales en un riesgo mucho mayor de lo que deberían ser”.
Las primeras dos ciudades donde se verían estos despliegues son Nueva York y Chicago, donde grupos defensores de inmigrantes están alertando a los indocumentados a mantenerse informados, además de acusar al DHS de propagar miedo entre la comunidad.
“La reciente decisión del presidente Trump de desplegar a los ‘agentes tácticos de élite’ de la Patrulla Fronteriza en ‘santuarios’ de localidades como Chicago es inhumana y amenaza la seguridad de todos los estadounidenses” , advirtió la Coalición Empresarial Americana de Inmigración. “Los datos muestran constantemente que la delincuencia es menor y las economías son más fuertes en las jurisdicciones ‘santuario'”.
La organización cita que líderes bipartidistas en Illinois, incluido el sheriff republicano Mark Curran y el sheriff demócrata Tom Dart , apoyaron la Ley de Confianza para limitar la cooperación entre ICE y la Policía local. Es
“La inmigración es un problema federal que requiere una solución federal”, adelantaron. “La seguridad es un problema local de aplicación de la ley. Mezclar ambos sólo crea nuevos problemas que podrían poner en peligro la seguridad de los ciudadanos”.

Leonhardt: Did Joe Biden scare off our next president?

Texto completo: More than four years ago, in the runup to the 2016 presidential campaign, many progressives were hoping Elizabeth Warren would run. Only after she passed on the race — evidently deciding that Hillary Clinton was too strong to be beaten — did a less prominent progressive enter: Bernie Sanders.
Last year, a different version of this scenario happened, this time in the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. Mitch Landrieu, Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg, among others, skipped the race, at least initially. Much as Clinton had scared off potential candidates in 2016, Joe Biden did so in 2020.
By now, the lesson from this history should be plain. If you want to be president of the United States and have an opportunity to run, you should not let another candidate keep you from running in the primaries.
Campaigns are too long and uncertain. And the odds of winning the presidency are never particularly good. Every Democrat to be elected president in the past half-century — Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter — started as a long shot, as did a couple of Republicans (Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan).
As political adviser David Axelrod once told Obama: “History tells us that candidates more often win by running early than by waiting their turn. The risk is not in running too soon. It’s in running too late and missing your opportunity.” Or as Axelrod told me last week, paraphrasing the old second baseman Eddie Stanky: “No-risk baseball is second-division baseball.”
With the current campaign mired in uncertainty, I think some Democrats and pundits are missing this lesson. Instead, it’s become common to talk about the damage that Biden supposedly did to this field. I have had a version of the thought myself: that Biden was strong enough to prevent other moderates from emerging without being strong enough to win the nomination himself.
But the early voting suggests that this analysis is more wrong than right. The problem wasn’t Biden. It was the way other Democrats overreacted to him. They committed a classic error of presidential politics, believing that campaigns were more predictable than they are.
Biden, after all, finished fifth in New Hampshire, with less than 9% of the vote. That’s not enough to crowd out anyone. Sure enough, he has not prevented Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of a small city, from becoming a serious candidate. Nor has Biden kept Amy Klobuchar’s once-moribund campaign from getting a new life. He hasn’t even kept Tom Steyer — Tom Steyer! — from surging in the South Carolina primary polls.
Imagine what this race might look like if other candidates had not taken a pass, delayed their entrance or dropped out early. South Carolina, the next primary (after Nevada’s caucus Saturday), would be especially significant. Biden’s once-huge lead there is shriveling — yet now there is no obvious alternative, especially for many of the state’s African American voters.
Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans whose soaring speech on Confederate statues gave him a national profile, could have been a strong candidate in South Carolina. If Bloomberg — who’s second among black voters nationwide, according to the Quinnipiac Poll — hadn’t been scared away from South Carolina by Biden, he might have made himself the clear moderate front-runner. He also could have reduced the perception that he was taking shortcuts.
Or imagine if Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, instead of quitting the race, had adopted a version of John McCain’s 2008 strategy. Like them, McCain entered the race as a potential front-runner, only to struggle. Far back in the polls and with little money left, he stripped down his campaign to the essentials and kept on running. McCain was making a bet on the unpredictability of politics. He won the nomination.
I’m not saying that any one of these outcomes would have been likely this year. I’m saying that the field could have been bigger and stronger than it is and that Democrats shouldn’t have been so bashful.
A candidate doesn’t even need to win the nomination for a long-shot campaign to pay off. Reagan set up his 1980 win by taking on an incumbent president, Gerald Ford, in 1976. Warren might be the front-runner today if she, rather than Sanders, had taken on Hillary Clinton four years ago.
So what does this lesson suggest about the rest of the 2020 campaign?
Don’t jump to premature conclusions — or premature despair, if you consider Trump a threat to democracy. I think Sanders, for instance, could be a problematic nominee, given his self-identification as a democratic socialist and his stances on fracking, immigration and health insurance. But I also think it’s silly to say he has no chance to beat Trump.
It wasn’t so long ago that people were claiming that the other moderates had no chance to beat Biden.

Millionaire Durst faces trial in friend's killing

Texto completo: BY BRIAN MELLEY
The Associated Press
LOS ANGELES - There is almost no physical evidence connecting New York real estate heir Robert Durst to the slaying of his best friend in Los Angeles 20 years ago.
What does link him to the killing of Susan Berman, though, is a cryptic note sent to police with her address and one word: "CADAVER."
The slip of paper intended to lead authorities to her lifeless body in December 2000 was penned by Durst. His lawyers have admitted as much. Durst himself has said more than once that only the killer or someone involved in the shooting could have written it.
Prosecutors intend to use the note and a web of circumstantial evidence to put Durst behind bars for three killings he's suspected of committing over nearly four decades. They will be up against a legal team that won Durst's acquittal in one of those deaths.
"Our defense is, one, he didn't do it, and, two, they can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did it," defense lawyer David Chesnoff said. "It is a highly circumstantial case and we will have strong responses to explain the circumstances."
Jury selection begins Wednesday in a case built around a story so sensational it inspired a feature film starring Ryan Gosling as Durst and a six-part documentary on his life that helped lead to his arrest.
Durst, 76, the eccentric son of a late prominent New York real estate developer, has pleaded not guilty. Said to be worth $100 million, and having jumped bail before, Durst has been awaiting trial in a California jail.
Suspicion has dogged Durst since his wife vanished in a New York suburb in 1982, a mystery that brought not only attention from the city's tabloids, but The New York Times. Berman was Durst's unofficial spokeswoman at the time and prosecutors said she helped him cover his tracks. No has ever been charged in the wife's disappearance and presumed killing.
Durst was back in the news following his arrest in October 2001 on charges he murdered his elderly neighbor in a $300-a-month rooming house Galveston, Texas. Prosecutors say he fled New York and disguised himself as a mute woman to elude possible arrest in his wife's suspected killing.
While Durst is only charged with one count of murder in Berman's killing, prosecutors plan to show he knocked her off Dec. 23, 2000, to keep her from telling police what she knew about the disappearance of Kathleen "Kathie" Durst.
They will introduce evidence that he killed and dismembered Morris Black in Galveston because the elderly neighbor had discovered his true identity and Durst feared he would inform police of his whereabouts.
"Kathie's death was the impetus for all of the tragic events that happened afterward,'' prosecutors said in court papers. They said Durst "devised and carried out a diabolical plan to cover up the killing of his wife which ultimately cost two other people their lives.''
Kathleen Durst's body was never found, though she's officially been declared dead. Black's dismembered remains were cast out to sea in garbage bags by Durst, who was cleared in the killing after testifying he shot the man in self-defense. Berman, 55, the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, was found face down in her Los Angeles home in a pool of blood. She had been shot point-blank in the back of the head.
Durst's arrest in Berman's killing came five years ago in New Orleans on the eve of the final installment of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" documentary on HBO. The finale contained a made-for-TV gotcha when filmmakers confronted Durst with a letter they unearthed that he had once written to Berman that contained nearly identical block-letter writing as the so-called cadaver note. Beverly Hills was misspelled the same way in both: "BEVERLEY."
Durst had denied penning the cadaver note, which he acknowledged "only the killer could have written," but couldn't distinguish between the two.
He blinked, burped and put his head in his hands before denying being the killer. After the interview, he went to use a toilet unaware he was still wearing a microphone. Filmmakers didn't realize until two years later as they were editing the film that they captured audio of him in the bathroom.
The film ends with Durst's voice: "You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."
But what sounds like a confession was actually a result of editing. Durst said all three of those sentences, but not in that order and interspersed with seemingly unintelligible or unrelated remarks, according to court records. Placed in their proper context, as jurors are likely to hear, will make them less of the bombshell that struck viewers.
Defense lawyers have said the filmmakers deceived Durst and were acting as government agents, providing evidence they unearthed to police.
Prosecutors also will be relying on former friends of both Durst and Berman, who have provided damaging accounts in pretrial testimony of Durst's alleged abuse of his wife. Some have said Berman confided in them that Durst had killed Kathleen. Berman said that if anything happened to her, they should suspect t Durst.
His lawyers are likely to focus on why some of those accounts were not shared with police and only surfaced recently after years of silence.
A star witness for the prosecution, New York ad executive Nathan "Nick" Chavin, who was best friends with both Durst and Berman, acknowledged that he lied to and misled prosecutors for months before coming clean about what he knew of the killing.
Chavin testified that in 2014 Durst confessed to Berman's killing on a New York sidewalk.
"I had to," Durst said, according to Chavin. "It was her or me, I had no choice."
Chavin, who became emotional during the pretrial testimony because of his deep friendship with Durst, said his loyalties were torn and ultimately he sided with Berman.

Texto completo: Charles Portis
NEW YORK - Novelist Charles Portis, a favorite among critics and writers for such shaggy dog stories as "Norwood" and "Gringos" and a bounty for Hollywood whose droll, bloody Western "True Grit" was a best-seller twice adapted into Oscar nominated films, died Monday at age 86.
Portis, a former newspaper reporter who apparently learned enough to swear off talking to the media, had been suffering from Alzheimer's in recent years. His brother, Jonathan Portis, told The Associated Press that he died in a hospice in Little Rock, Ark., his longtime residence.
Charles Portis was among the most admired authors to nearly vanish from public consciousness in his own lifetime. His fans included Tom Wolfe, Roy Blount Jr. and Larry McMurtry, and he was often compared to Mark Twain for his plainspoken humor and wry perspective. Portis saw the world from the ground up, from bars and shacks and trailer homes, and few spun wilder and funnier stories. In a Portis novel, usually set in the South and south of the border, characters embarked on journeys that took the most unpredictable detours.
In "Norwood," an ex-Marine from Texas heads East in a suspicious car to collect a suspicious debt, but winds up on a bus with a circus dwarf, a chicken and a girl he just met. "The Dog of the South" finds one Ray Midge driving from Arkansas to Honduras in search of his wife, his credit cards and his Ford Torino. In "Gringos," an expatriate in Mexico with a taste for order finds himself amid hippies, end-of-the-world cultists and disappearing friends.
The public knew Portis best for "True Grit," the quest of Arkansas teen Mattie Ross to avenge her father's murder. The novel was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in 1968 and was soon adapted (and softened) as a film showcase for John Wayne, who starred as Rooster Cogburn, the drunken, one-eyed marshal Mattie enlists to find the killer. The role brought Wayne his first Academy Award and was revived by the actor, much less successfully, in the sequel "Rooster Cogburn."
Rooster was so strong a character that a new generation of filmgoers and Oscar voters welcomed him back. In 2010, the Coen brothers worked up a less glossy, more faithful "True Grit," featuring Jeff Bridges as Rooster and newcomer Hallie Steinfeld as Mattie. The film received 10 nominations, including best actor for Bridges, and brought new attention to Portis and his novel, which topped the trade paperback list of The New York Times.
"No living Southern writer captures the spoken idioms of the South as artfully as Portis does," Mississippi native Donna Tartt wrote in an afterword for a 2005 reissue of the novel.
Portis was born in 1933 in El Dorado, Arkansas, one of four children of a school superintendent and a housewife whom Portis thought could have been a writer herself. As a kid, he loved comic books and movies and the stories he learned from his family. In a brief memoir written for The Atlantic Monthly, he recalled growing up in a community where the ratio was about "two Baptist churches or one Methodist church per gin. It usually took about three gins to support a Presbyterian church, and a community with, say, four before you found enough tepid idolators to form an Episcopal congregation."
He was a natural raconteur who credited his stint in the Marines with giving him time to read. After leaving the service, he graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1958 with a degree in journalism and for the next few years was a newspaper man, starting as a night police reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal and finishing as London bureau chief for the New York Herald Tribune.
Fellow Tribune staffers included Wolfe, who regarded Portis as "the original laconic cutup" and a fellow rebel against the boundaries of journalism, and Nora Ephron, who would remember her colleague as a sociable man with a reluctance to use a telephone. His interview subjects included Malcolm X and J.D. Salinger, whom Portis encountered on an airplane. He was also a first-hand observer of the civil rights movement. In 1963, he covered a riot and the police beating of black people in Birmingham, Alabama. Around the same time, he reported on a Ku Klux Klan meeting, a dullish occasion after which "the grand dragon of Mississippi disappeared grandly into the Southern night, his car engine hitting on about three cylinders."
Anxious to write novels, Portis left the paper in 1964 and from Arkansas completed "Norwood," published two years later and adapted for a 1970 movie of the same name starring Glen Campbell and Joe Namath.
Portis placed his stories in familiar territory. He knew his way around Texas and Mexico and worked enough with women stringers from the Ozarks in Arkansas to draw upon them for Mattie's narrative voice in "True Grit." He eventually settled in Little Rock, where he reportedly spent years working on a novel that was never released. "Gringos," his fifth and last novel, came out in 1991.
Portis published short fiction in The Atlantic during the 1990s, but was mostly forgotten before admiring essays in Esquire and the New York Observer by Ron Rosenbaum were noticed by publishing director Tracy Carns of the Overlook Press, which reissued all of Portis' novels. Some of his journalism, short stories and travel writings were published in the 2012 anthology "Escape Velocity."
In recent years, the author lived in open seclusion, a regular around Little Rock who drove a pickup truck, enjoyed an occasional beer and stepped away from reporters. He did turn up to collect The Oxford American's Award for Lifetime Achievement in Southern Literature and was known to answer the occasional letter from a reader. But otherwise Portis seemed to honor Mattie's code in "True Grit" for how to deal with journalists.
"I do not fool around with newspapers," Mattie says. "The paper editors are great ones for reaping where they have not sown. Another game they have is to send reporters out to talk to you and get your stories free. I know the young reporters are not paid well and I would not mind helping those boys out with their 'scoops' if they could ever get anything right."

George Soros calls for Zuckerberg, Sandberg to step down from Facebook in scathing letter

Texto completo: George Soros called for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's respective CEO and COO, to be "removed from control" in a letter published in Financial Times.
The liberal billionaire, who has long been a vocal critic of Facebook's head executives and is the subject of many fabricated conspiracy theories peddled on the platform, reiterated the claim that Zuckerberg is in "some kind of mutual assistance arrangement" with President Donald Trump for his re-election.
"If there is any doubt whether an ad is political, it should err on the side of caution and refuse to publish," wrote Soros. "It is unlikely that Facebook will follow this course. "
The sentiment is similar to a speech he gave at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, in which he claimed some "kind of informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook. " He did not verify this claim, and it was denied by the company.
The company also rejected Soros' claims in the letter. In a statement to USA TODAY, a representative from Facebook said that the suggestion that the company is connected to a figure or party "runs counter to our values and the facts. "
George Soros: Facebook, Zuckerberg in cahoots with Trump to win 2020 election
An analysis from the Guardian published last month found that Trump spent around $20 million on hundreds of thousands of ads on Facebook, some of which were false, outspending all the Democratic candidates.
Despite a litany of criticism, Facebook continues to run political advertising on its platform, repeatedly stating that it should not litigate the legitimacy of claims made in campaign ads.
Their policy is in contrast to Twitter's ban on all political advertising, which was enacted last November, and Google's heightened restrictions on targeted political ads, which began in January. A letter signed by hundreds of Facebook employees to Zuckerberg opposing the company's policy was published in the New York Times last October.
An op-ed written by Zuckerberg — also published on Financial Times Sunday — was in support for greater regulation of "Big Tech," but expressed continued support for keeping political ads on the website. Soros wrote that Zuckerberg was intentionally "obfuscating the facts" in that piece.
He made it readily apparent, however, that he supports "government regulation of social media platforms. "

Texto completo: Pier 1 Imports, a trendy home goods retailer, is closing hundreds of stores nationwide -- including one in Maine -- as the company enters into bankruptcy proceedings.
The retailer announced last month that it planned to close up to 450 of its 963 stores, according to The New York Times. Among those locations set to close is Pier 1's Augusta location on Stephen King Drive, according to a list released by the retailer. Another 20 locations across New England are slated for closure as well.
Pier 1's South Portland location, at The Maine Mall, is not among those planned for closure.
On Monday, Pier 1 announced it had filed for bankruptcy, The New York Times reports. It is the latest brick-and-mortar retailer -- such as Macy's and Sears, both which have closed locations at the Bangor Mall in recent years -- to face hard times as more consumers look to online retailers, such as Amazon and Wayfair.
Pier 1 was founded in 1962 in San Mateo, California.

The case against the nuclear family

Texto completo: When the history of our era is written, scholars will search for larger causes to explain its bitterness and contradictions, despite so much wealth. Was it globalization? Populism? Economic inequality? Polarization? Greed? To this list you can now add an unlikely candidate: the nuclear family.
In a powerful essay for The Atlantic - "The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake" - New York Times columnist David Brooks argues that "the family structure we've held up as the cultural ideal for the past half-century has been a catastrophe for many."
By "nuclear family," he means a married mother and father and some kids. The alternative arrangement was "the extended family," which included not only Mom, Dad and the children but also close relatives - cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents - as well as family friends.
The great defect of the nuclear family, Brooks asserts, is that if there's a crisis - a death, divorce, job loss, poor school grades - there's no backup team. Children are most vulnerable to these disruptions and often are left to fend for themselves. There's a downward spiral. "In many sectors of society," Brooks writes, "nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families, [and] single-parent families into chaotic families or no families."
People could increasingly go their own way. The advent of the birth-control pill encouraged people to have sex out of marriage. Women's entrance into the labor market made it easier for them to support themselves. Modern appliances (washing machines, dryers) made housework simpler.
As Brooks sees it, almost everyone loses under this system. The affluent can best cope with it, because they can usually afford what's needed (day care, tutors) to support their children. Otherwise, the picture is bleak.
Children have it worst. Brooks cites an avalanche of statistics. In 1960, about 5% of children were born to unmarried women. Now that's about 40%. In 1960, about 11% of children lived apart from their father; in 2010, the figure was 27%.
But adult men and women also have their share of troubles. There's a vicious circle at work, notes Brooks: "People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers. People who don't have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families. ... The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized."
Brooks says he wrote the article to stimulate experiments that aim to stabilize family life using the "extended family" - not the nuclear family - as the model. The problem may not be as big as Brooks imagines. Estimates by the Census Bureau and others indicate that about 60% of Americans live in the state where they were born. Presumably, many of these people stayed put because they valued nearby family ties.
Whatever the actual figures, there's little doubt that reversing the breakdown of families, and its consequences, is one of the urgent tasks of social policy in the 21st century. We have been struggling unsuccessfully with it since the so-called "Moynihan Report" in 1965. (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later became a senator, warned that the breakdown of black marriage rates would have a devastating effect on African Americans' well-being.) The report proved highly controversial, and some branded Moynihan a racist.
But even if we could magically eliminate all considerations of class and race, it's not clear that a workable model would emerge. The conditions needed to broach a debate over family policies strike at the heart of America's political and cultural conflicts. Brooks put it this way:
"We value privacy and individual freedom too much. Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose."
Brooks finds both liberals and conservatives unequal to the task of dealing candidly with family breakdown. "Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning. Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; 'go live in a nuclear family' is really not relevant advice.  the majority [of households] are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families." He's just as tough on progressives. They "still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them.  But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people."
The larger issue is how we judge our times. We are constantly deluged with economic studies and statistics, implying that economic outcomes are the only ones that matter. The reality is that any national scorecard of well-being must take a much broader view. How well families do in preparing children for adulthood and how well they transmit important values is a much higher standard for success.

NYU OB-GYN to bring Cesarean section research to Fort Myers World-renowned Clarel Antoine, M.D., FACOG — an OB-GYN at NYU Langone Health and an associate professor at NYU — is bringing his research on cesarean sections to Fort Myers via medical offices and community speaking engagements.
Dr. Antoine's studies are geared toward reducing or reversing the growing trend of placenta accreta (PA). This serious condition occurs when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall — making it difficult for the placenta to detach, resulting in a deadly amount of blood loss following childbirth and often necessitating a life-saving hysterectomy. PA is often associated with a prior C-section, which occurs in one-third of deliveries in the U.S.
Most recently, Dr. Antoine contributed to a write-up on nyulangone.org and The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine. It breaks down a study on cesarean deliveries and vaginal births after cesarean deliveries in his practice from 1985 to 2015.
For more information on Dr. Antoine's passion for improved OB-GYN care, visit nyulangone.org or call Compassionate Ob/Gyn Care, PLLC at (212) 826-3300.
National Speakers' Series examines evidence-based weight loss As part of the National Speakers' Series, Lee Health is pleased to present Michael Greger, M.D., FACLM, who will present 'Evidence-Based Weight Loss – The Groundbreaking Science of Healthy, Permanent Weight Loss.'
A founding member and Fellow of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, Michael Greger, MD, is a physician, New York Times best-selling author and internationally recognized speaker on nutrition, food safety and public health issues. He has lectured at the Conference on World Affairs, testified before Congress and was invited as an expert witness in the defense of Oprah Winfrey in the infamous "meat defamation" trial.
In 2017, Dr. Greger was honored with the ACLM Lifestyle Medicine Trailblazer Award. He is a graduate of Cornell University School of Agriculture and Tufts University School of Medicine. His book, How Not to Die, became an instant New York Times best seller. He has videos on more than 2,000 health topics freely available at nutritionfacts.org. All proceeds he receives from his books, DVDs and speaking engagements are donated to charity.
The free talk is open to the public and will be held on Monday, March 2, 6 p.m. at the First Christian Church, 2061 McGregor Blvd., Fort Myers.

Cefalo starred as a wide receiver at Pittston Area High School and then Penn State University before going on to play with the Miami Dolphins in the National Football League.
“He’s a local guy who made it pretty big. It’s a big deal for us to have him back,” said Matt Meade, current president of the Pittston Friendly Sons. “It’s an honor to have him come up and share his story and get together with some of his former teammates.”
Meade noted he was a student at Pittston Area when the legendary Cefalo was in town years ago for the opening of the Cefalo athletic center at the football stadium.
“I never met the man personally. I’m excited to meet him,” Meade said.
Cefalo has always been recognized as a hometown hero by those in the Pittston community. His image is among the famous Pittstonians painted on a mural on the side of the former Newrose Hotel on Main Street. Cefalo was on hand for its unveiling in 2015. In 2016, he threw out the first pitch before a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders game. In 2017, he was named grand marshal of the Pittston Tomato Festival parade.
At Pittston Area, Cefalo was a consensus high school All-American and later was named as a member of The Pennsylvania Football News All-Century Team.
One of the country’s most highly recruited players, Cefalo wrote a series of articles for The New York Times about his life as a scholar athlete.
“I was 14 years old when the siege began and 17 when it ended. I received 2,856 pieces of mail, was contacted by six United States congressmen, the governor of Maryland, Hank Aaron, hundreds of businessmen and about 150 college football coaches,” Cefalo wrote about the recruitment process.
Cefalo was a standout at Penn State University from 1974 to 1977 under Coach Joe Paterno. He earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1978. When Joe Paterno died in 2011, Cefalo was asked to provide a eulogy.
Cefalo was a third-round draft choice of the Miami Dolphins in 1978. He played seven seasons and appeared in two Super Bowls. In 1984, Cefalo caught the Dan Marino pass that broke the most touchdown passes in a season record.
Following his playing career, Cefalo went on to become an Emmy award-winning radio and television broadcaster and writer. He’s now known as the “Voice of the Dolphins.” Cefalo also co-owns a television station, a production company and a specialty wine store.
“When I read his biography, I didn’t realize how much he did outside the sports world,” Meade said.
Tickets for the Friendly Sons dinner can be purchased through any member of the organization or can be bought at the Pittston Knights of Columbus any Thursday evening.

Texto completo: Our series “How I became a …” digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
Though Robin Arzon spends a lot of time on a spin bike, you’ll never catch her spinning her own wheels. Arzon started her career as a lawyer before transitioning to the fitness space and has since used movement and exercise as a way to shape and transform her life and the lives of those around her. When she’s not pedaling to thousands of live and on-demand riders at New York’s Peloton studio, Arzon spends her time as a global Adidas ambassador, Road Runners Club of America-certified running coach, social media influencer, and New York Times bestselling author of “Shut Up and Run. ”
USA TODAY caught up with Peloton’s VP of Fitness Programming to talk about everything from hydrating properly and the Lizzo “lifestyle” to rising above and learning to lean heavily into resilience.
Question: How did you get your start?
Robin Arzon: I really entered fitness as a runner. I laced up and I discovered a passion for movement. I am VP of Fitness Programming at Peloton and a head instructor at Peloton because I emailed John Foley and I was brave enough to put myself forward and put my hat in the ring to audition for a teaching position here. The big, broader wellness conversation kind of started when I was a lawyer and I was dealing with my own traumas and my own dramas. I really used movement as a tool to unlock and empower, and that is how I became a wellness leader.
Q: What does a typical day look like for you?
Arzon: There is no typical day, I’ll be honest about that. But, I’ll give you the answer on an ideal day because that is maybe more interesting. An ideal day for me would be getting nine hours of sleep, waking up, meditating for 20 minutes, fueling (I always fuel properly with a smoothie with all kinds of vitamins and plant-based fuel), and then I would get in a workout. I would get in my own personal workout. My life is a workout, but my own personal workout is critical, and that will usually involve something related to strength training. I’m always, always staying hydrated – you cannot hustle without the proper hydration, and in my opinion, with plain ole’ water, as optimally. I like to optimize my day with ROAR Organic and electrolytes, and then after my workout, an ideal day would involve some type of work. I honestly feel so fulfilled with the kind of work I do at Peloton, so sometimes that’s going to be teaching a class, sometimes that’s going to be making a playlist, and sometimes it’s going to be just getting my mind and mental space right for tomorrow’s hustle.
Then, I will spend time with my husband or my family and just nourish my soul, and then I will do something that is perhaps unexpected, like a moment getting into the more critical things. It’s the mental grit. I like to take moments to really nourish and educate about things that I might not even know. That’s where master classes, that’s where picking up a book, or that’s where doing the thing, almost the mental callousing of my brain, is a critical part of my ideal day. And then, honestly, it’s the boring stuff. It’s fueling, it’s drinking, it’s stocking the fridge, it’s taking the time to breathe, (and) it’s taking the time to take my second meditation. Then, at the end of the day, it is being prouder when I went to bed than when I woke up in the morning in the ways that are really, really critical by the standards we espouse. I take that really seriously. I think our legacy is comprised of small decisions.
Q: What is your favorite part about your job?
Arzon: I’m really proud of the Peloton community. I’m really proud of the community that we have created, and honestly, that is a passion piece that I’m really proud of. I think that is honestly (how I know) I’m in alignment because that is the proudest part of my day.
Q: What do you credit your success to?
Arzon: My success is firmly rooted in knowing I will always rise above the BS.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule?
Arzon: This might be an unpopular opinion, but there is no real balance. There are priorities, and a work ethic strong enough to get there. So, I would say I have listened to my gut, and I have established my North Star: which is to do epic things in this world. It’s not about balance: It’s about listening to yourself and identifying a standard for greatness that is at the same time achievable and aspirational. People are looking for ways to find balance, but the way that you achieve a feeling of joy is identifying what is valuable and what is achievable. What you haven’t achieved yet is worth getting uncomfortable and digging into, and that’s not always going to be a feeling of balance. That will be a feeling of joy when you get there, and you create your own.
Q: What have been some of your biggest career highs?
Arzon: I will never forget crossing the finish line of a 100-mile race; I will never forget standing alongside my fellow instructors for the Peloton moments that make us really, really powerful like All for One or Homecoming; being in Times Square with my fellow instructors on the day that Peloton went public, the day that my book came out.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Arzon: Trust your struggle. I think that being brave enough to own your journey requires trusting your struggle. There’s no way that you’re going to follow in someone’s footsteps exactly, but I think if you admire someone’s journey, there is something about their journey that is perhaps a mirror of values you root yours in. I think trusting your struggle is incredibly important, and being brave enough to actually have experiences where you fail. The journeys that I admire in business and life and in spirituality, or even just people like my mother (who is a superhero), have an element of resilience, and critically require bravery. The tattoo that I have on my ribcage says “resilient stock,” and it is in honor of my mother, but it is also in honor of the bravery that a great story requires.
Quick hits
• What’s your coffee order? I don’t drink coffee – I am a matcha person. I would do matcha with just water
• What’s your favorite book? The most transformative book I’ve read in the last five years is “The Year of Yes” by Shonda Rhimes
• What’s your favorite song at the moment? “Juice” by Lizzo. It’s a lifestyle choice
• Who’s been one of your biggest mentors? One of my biggest mentors is someone I haven’t even met, Michelle Obama. It’s not because I know her personally – I wish – but (because) she demonstrates and lives her life by the principles I aspire to have and the grace I try to have with myself, and with the responsibility of creating a legacy that matters. I think mentors aspire us to action, and she is one of mine.
• What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever done? It’s not a day or an achievement; it’s a way of life. One of the coolest things I’ve ever done is learned how to become resilient and trust my hustle. I think that is everything from knowing that my bag is stocked with ROAR and I’m staying hydrated, but also trusting that I know how to prepare for small and big victories. I think that the iterative process to success is going to be challenging, but it’s knowing that you have the backbone and the processes and the things in your superhero toolkit to rise.

Texto completo: LONDON - On a finger numbingly cold morning, Lara Maiklem swung open a metal gate tucked behind a pub in southeast London and scrambled down a set of slick stone steps onto the banks of the River Thames.
The river runs through the city west to east, bisecting London as it winds past the new skyscrapers and old docks that line its banks.
But twice a day, the low tide pulls the flowing edges of the Thames back - dropping the river level by 20 feet in some areas - revealing centuries of forgotten London life in the fragments that poke out from the newly exposed land, known as the foreshore.
This is when the mudlarks, like Maiklem, come out.
"What you are looking for are straight lines and perfect circles," she said, her eyes scanning the surface of the mud for man-made artifacts. "They sort of stand out from the natural shapes."
Within minutes she had spotted fragments of a 17th-century jug, the half-face of a bearded man visible in the clay.
The name - mudlark - was first given to the Victorian-era poor who scrounged for items in the river to sell, pulling copper scraps, rope and other valuables from the shore. But more recently the label has stuck to London's hobbyists, history buffs and treasure hunters who scour the river edge searching for objects from the city's past.
Mudlarking's popularity has grown steadily in recent years, driven in part by social media communities in which enthusiasts share their finds and tour groups that offer a trudge through the shards of history's castoffs.
Dr. Fiona Haughey, a London archaeologist who has worked on the Thames since the 1990s, said that although some mudlarks are looking for valuables, others are looking for a connection with the everyday objects of a bygone Britain.
But it's the connection with the layers of lives of Londoners before them, revealed by the tides of the river at the heart of the metropolis, that unites the enthusiasts.
For Haughey, a specialist in prehistory, it's about what an object can tell her about its owner rather than what value it has.
"I love the conundrum of it," she said.
The Port of London Authority, which owns the Thames waterway along with the Crown Estate (i.e. Queen Elizabeth II), began to regulate exploration along the shore in 2016, requiring anyone searching the banks to have a foreshore permit.
These permits - about 1,500 were issued this year - allow people to explore the terrain, and scrape or dig into the mud up to a depth of around 3 inches. Mudlarks are advised to report objects that could be of archaeological interest to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, run by the British Museum.
Stuart Wyatt, the regional finds liaison officer based at the Museum of London who assesses the artifacts, said there was a "huge increase in numbers" of mudlarks in recent years.
"I now have months where I see only new finders," he said by email.
Britain legally obligates anyone who unearths "treasure" - defined as single finds of gold and silver over 300 years old, and hoards of coins and prehistoric metalwork - to inform the government.
Britain takes this law seriously, as one amateur treasure hunter learned in November. He was given a decadelong jail sentence after failing, along with another man, to report the discovery of a Viking hoard they dug up in western England.
A specialized permit allows deeper digging to a depth of nearly 4 feet. But those permits are available only to members of the exclusive Society of Thames Mudlarks - an invitation-only group of around 50 members - who have already held a standard permit and reported their findings to the Museum of London for two years.
Some mudlarks bring metal detectors. But most simply recover what the river has naturally revealed, usually a fascinating trinket rather than treasure.
"I like just to collect what the river decides it's going to leave on that day," Maiklem said. "It's that element of luck."
But sometimes there are more significant finds, like the first "spintria" found in Britain. Spintriae are Roman bronze tokens, with depictions of sexual acts on one face and a Roman numeral on the other, whose purpose remains uncertain.
And every tide reveals some of the city's varied story: Roman coins, medieval badges worn by religious pilgrims, an elaborate 17th-century watch.
The Thames, the very reason people began settling in the city over 2,000 years ago, is one of the best preservers of London's history. The river has been used many ways over the millenniums - as a highway, a source of food and, most important to mudlarks, as a dump.
"The Thames is unpredictable, so its just all mixed up, like a big washing machine," said Jason Sandy, an architect who mudlarks in his spare time.
In the center of London, where the heart of the Roman city stood, many of the finds are Roman or medieval. Farther west, evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found.
Where Maiklem was exploring, in Rotherhithe, once an old shipping center in eastern London, finds from the 16th and 17th centuries are the norm.
This particular morning, the sun was just rising and the tide was still on its way out as she clambered over rocks.
Her eyes flicked quickly over the mud, scattered with bits of modern trash, and settled on the barely visible edge of a coin nestled against a wooden post. She plucked it out and wiped away the grime, revealing a George III farthing, the silhouetted face of the monarch and the date, 1777, nearly rubbed smooth.
The coin had been bent into an "S" shape and had a small hole poked through its edge where a chain could be attached, hallmarks that it was likely a love token. At her feet, pieces of clay tobacco pipes from the 16th and 17th century clinked as they washed against rocks, so common as to escape a mudlark's interest.
But a perfectly round musket ball was worth plucking from the muck. The leather sole of a hand-stitched shoe, preserved by the anaerobic mud, flapped in the breeze, and she tugged at its toes to wrest it from the bank.
Huge wooden beams from the ships broken up here in the 17th and 18th centuries jut out of the mud. The Mayflower is believed to have been broken down here for scrap.
"There are so many ghosts locked in the foreshore," Maiklem said. "Also, it's so fleeting because if it's not collected from the surface, it's going to be washed away or broken down."

At Seton Hall, a quest to get the innocent out of jail

Texto completo: For nearly a decade, Lesley and D. Michael Risinger pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses, consulted firearms experts and argued in courtrooms, with help of a team of Seton Hall law students.
Their goal: Free two men they believed were wrongly convicted for a double murder in Camden a quarter-century ago.
That chance at freedom came Dec. 26, when a New Jersey appeals court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial for Kevin Baker and Shawn Washington, who were found guilty of the killings and locked away in state prison in 1996.
For the husband-and-wife legal team who run the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, it was a hard-fought first victory after years of work to make the justice system face up to its own flaws.
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," said Lesley Risinger, who co-founded the program in 2011 and serves as director. "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
The Exoneration Project is driven by a key premise — that the criminal justice system makes mistakes and may send people to prison for crimes they did not commit. An estimated 1% to 5% of those in prison have been wrongfully convicted, according to a report last year ordered by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.
Assuming a 1% rate of wrongful conviction in New Jersey, nearly 200 of those currently in a state prison population of about 19,500 people are innocent. Yet there have been only 37 overturned convictions in the state since 1989, the report said.
'Total failure of the defense' Lesley Risinger first got involved in cases of the wrongfully accused nearly 30 years ago, when she helped her mother, an attorney, appeal the conviction of Luis Kevin Rojas of Weehawken. Rojas, 18 at the time of the alleged crime, had been found guilty of a fatal shooting in 1990, but the case was marred by mistaken identity and missing eyewitness testimony, his attorneys successfully argued. He was freed after a retrial in 1998.
Risinger later represented Fernando Bermudez, who was convicted in a 1991 Manhattan murder, but the case was based on perjured testimony, Risinger argued. In 2009, a judge freed Bermudez after 18 years in prison.
In 2011, the Risingers launched the Last Resort Exoneration Project and got many letters from prisoners claiming innocence and looking for help. With help from law students, they vet cases for evidence that could prove a conviction was improper.
The application from Kevin Baker, one of the two convicts in the Camden case, was compelling.
"It cried out for attention simply based on the weakness of the evidence and the total failure of the defense to present a defense," said Lesley Risinger, 62, a former adjunct professor who graduated from the law school in 2003.
The case rested on testimony from a single witness who was high on crack at the time of the shooting and whose story was so shaky that defense lawyers thought it wouldn't be believed, Risinger said. The state called six witnesses during the two-day trial, while the defense called none, court records show.
The proceedings ended in a guilty verdict and life sentences with no chance of parole for 60 years. John Wynne, an assistant Camden County prosecutor on the case, told The New York Times in 1996 that even he was surprised by the verdict.
"We had to do the investigation that should have been done then," said D. Michael Risinger, 72, the associate director of the Exoneration Project.
Last month, a state appeals court finally agreed, ordering a new trial. The court ruled that additional evidence not presented at the time "probably would have changed the jury's verdict." Jurors never heard a recording of Baker's 911 call or a forensics analysis showing that the shooting could not have happened as the witness described, the court found.
Baker and Washington, who is represented by Lawrence Lustberg, an attorney with Gibbons P.C. in Newark, remain in state prison in Trenton waiting to find out whether the Camden County prosecutor will seek a new trial.
The Risingers hope a conviction review unit created by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office last year will end the case and the Prosecutor's Office will determine that pursuing it "would be fruitless and unjust."
In a statement, Grewal said his office and Camden prosecutors are "committed to pursuing the just result in each and every case.
"We are actively reviewing this case, including the trial evidence and the extensive appellate and post-conviction proceedings that have taken place over the past 25 years," Grewal said.
A passion for the work The Last Resort Exoneration Project is similar to "innocence projects" that rely on DNA to prove that individuals did not commit crimes of which they were accused.
But the Risingers have taken an even more difficult route, choosing cases that lack DNA evidence but where other facts show the defendants did not receive a fair trial. They said they closely review applications to see where there's a strong legal case to prove innocence.
The Baker case is the Exoneration Project's first overturned conviction and required extensive litigation, expert analysis and hundreds of legal exhibits. The Risingers said they have also given close consideration to at least a dozen more cases.
About half a dozen law school students volunteer with the program each year. Over nine years, about a dozen worked on the Camden case, studying case files, reviewing trial documents and giving feedback on oral arguments.
They include Renee Mariotti, a part-time law student from New York City who chose Seton Hall Law in part for the chance to work at the Exoneration Project. Her interest came after listening to podcasts about wrongful convictions, in particular the Baltimore murder case of Adnan Syed made famous in the podcast "Serial."
"These are men who have been imprisoned for, coming up on 25 years, crimes they did not commit," Mariotti said of Baker and Washington. "It's nice to see the law working in what feels like the right way in this case. That's not always the outcome."
Amy Cuzzolino, a Bloomfield native who graduated in 2016, helped review applications to find viable legal cases. Her work gave her more insight into how the justice system works — and fails, she said.
"I didn't come away with a sense that the system is bad because of bad actors in it. It's more a question of inefficiency and limited resources. There are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but don't know how," said Cuzzolino, who is studying for an advanced degree in international law.
The Risingers, who live in Kearny, don't take a salary for their work. Private donations to the program pay for expenses like buying transcripts and consulting experts.
Michael Risinger, who worked on civil rights cases involving wrongful police shootings in the '70s and '80s, said he has devoted his career to making sure the legal system is accurate, especially in criminal cases. The former Seton Hall law professor served on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Evidence for 25 years.
He and his wife, who married in 2004 and have six children from previous marriages, see their work with the Exoneration Project as a calling, he said.
"We have sufficient money. We live very frugally, and we don't have ambitions to take grand tours or anything," he said. "We'd rather do this."

Texto completo: LAFAYETTE – President Donald Trump's administration is considering placing a ban on General Electric jet engine sales to China, a move that could potentially impact part of a local manufacturing plant that produces parts of the engines in Lafayette.
The administration may decline to issue a license allowing CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran SA, to export more of its LEAP 1C jet engines to China, according to the Wall Street Journal. The engines are being used to develop China's Comac C919 jetliner, a narrow-body twinjet airliner that first flew in 2017 and is part of China's effort to build up its jetliner industry.
The LEAP 1C engine is the sole engine designed for use with the Comac C919 and thus, a Trump administration ban on sales to China could cause an infinite delay in production of the C919.
The C919 is scheduled to go into passenger service in 2021.
The New York Times is reporting that officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere fear China may eventually be able to reverse engineer GE's technology, which could give the country an economic and security edge over the U.S.
The 225,000 square-foot facility in Lafayette opened in 2014. Scott Walker, president and CEO of Greater Lafayette Commerce, said the plant has always had a goal of employing 300 people.
The Lafayette facility mainly produces parts for the LEAP 1A and LEAP 1B, which would not be impacted by the potential Trump administration ban, which focuses only on the LEAP 1C engine.
"GE has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades. We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests," according to GE spokesperson Perry Bradley, who provided a statement to the Journal & Courier after the story was first published.
The LEAP engine is half assembled at GE's facilities in Lafayette and in Durham, North Carolina. Safran's plant in Villaroche, France assembles the balance.
The Hill reported the administration is expected to discuss a possible ban on sales of the 1C engine to China during an interagency meeting Thursday, revolving around how to reduce the number of exports of U.S. technology to China, and again during a cabinet meeting Feb. 28.
Walker said he suspected that a percentage of sales of the LEAP engines made in the Lafayette plant were sold to China, but the Trump administration considering a ban on the sales would not likely cause great harm to the local economy.
The current Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Tippecanoe County, Walker said, was around $2.4 billion in 2018. Before the GE plant opened in 2014, the GDP was still close to around $2 billion.
Lafayette is home to a large manufacturing economy, including GE Aviation, Subaru Automotive and Caterpillar.
"So, while a portion of our economy is due to GE, it's not a majority," Walker said. "Overall, the benefit our economy has is the diverse manufacturers operating in different industries, so we can whether different storms or cycles that come along."

WITH A REGULATOR LIKE THIS, WHO NEEDS AN INVESTMENT BANKER? ANTITRUST OFFICIAL REVIEWING THE T-MOBILE-SPRINT MERGER CHOSE TO NEGLECT CONSUMERS

Texto completo: The merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. is an abomination. It reduces the number of wireless companies to three from four, defies decades of legal precedents and all but assures higher prices for consumers.
I'd like to aim my focus on the deal's investment banker: Makan Delrahim. True, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust department wasn't officially the investment banker. But unofficially, the man responsible for deciding whether the deal would proceed worked hard behind the scenes to make it happen. He ought to get a fee.
The Obama administration had rejected the deal earlier, and most analysts thought President Donald Trump's Justice Department would turn it down as well. One of the big issues was what the deal would mean for the next-generation wireless network, known as 5G. If T-Mobile and Sprint merged, another company that was willing and able to build its own 5G network to compete with the other wireless carriers would have to come to the fore.
According to texts that were made public as part of a lawsuit, Mr. Delrahim "played a crucial role in bringing together top executives of T-Mobile, Sprint and another company, Dish Network LLC, for negotiations," as the New York Times put it. He coached executives of the three companies on how to approach legislators and persuade them to put pressure on Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, which also had to approve the deal. He gave his personal email address to Dish Chairman Charles Ergen so they could communicate behind the scenes.
In the end, T-Mobile agreed to give Dish access to its network while the latter company - which has plenty of spectrum but has never been in the phone business - built its 5G competitor. (T-Mobile also made the somewhat unlikely promise that it would cover 97% of the U.S. with its own 5G network within three years.) Having brokered the Dish deal, Mr. Delrahim then approved T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint.
In an article about Mr. Delrahim's involvement, the Times said that "it is not unusual for a law enforcement official to work behind the scenes to help companies overcoming antitrust concerns." In fact, it is extremely unusual - or at least it was before the Trump administration came along. Government regulators aren't supposed to broker deals; they're supposed to judge whether they pass antitrust muster.
Usually, state attorneys general and the Justice Department are aligned on whether or not a deal should be approved. Not this time. When 13 states (plus the District of Columbia) sued to block the merger, Mr. Delrahim didn't leave it to the companies to defend their deal. The Justice Department filed a brief on the side of the companies.
If the states prevailed, he told the court, it would create chaos in the merger market because companies could no longer be sure that federal approval was all they needed to make a deal. He said that his division had expertise that the states lacked and therefore the court should defer to federal antitrust officials. Earlier, he told the Wall Street Journal that he "worries the merger market could suffer if the states prevail"- as if that's his job.
Why was Mr. Delrahim so gung-ho to push through the T-Mobile-Sprint deal? Because his boss, Mr. Trump, wants to see the U.S. beat China in the race to establish 5G as the standard network - and that's what T-Mobile was essentially promising. As regular readers know, the antitrust chief has consistently carried Mr. Trump's water, opposing deals proposed by companies the president wanted to punish, like AT&T-Time Warner, while waving through deals proposed by his allies, like Disney-21st Century Fox. Most absurd of all, Mr. Delrahim's division even sued the auto companies - on antitrust grounds - that sided with California over Washington in a fight over emissions standards. (The suit was dropped late last week.)
Mr. Delrahim is one of the more public members of the Trump administration. He regularly gives high-minded speeches before groups that have an interest in antitrust law. He often harks back to old Supreme Court decisions, to important moments in antitrust, to the importance of protecting consumer welfare. To hear him talk, you'd think he was just as concerned with the rule of law as any of his predecessors.
But to watch him act - as he just did during the T-Mobile-Sprint deal - is to realize that he's just another Trump lackey putting the president before the people he's supposed to serve.

THE DECADE WHEN GIRL POWER BECAME GIRL TROUBLE

Texto completo: "90S BITCH: MEDIA, CULTURE AND THE FAILED PROMISE OF GENDER EQUALITY." By Allison Yarrow Harper PerenniaL ($16.99)
As a girl in the '90s, I idolized the Spice Girls, spent my birthday and Christmas money on "Girl Power" notebooks and scrunchies, and saw many a Victoria's Secret catalog arrive in the mailbox. I was awash in a hot pink, midriff-bearing, "MTV Real World" culture that was rewarding and punishing women in weird ways, to say the least.
Punchlines about battered women who fought back? I thought it was normal. My middle school history teacher talking about the president and his intern in the Oval Office? That too. The decade taught me that I had to look good, like boys (but not too much), buy stuff and, most of all, use the women that society praised as a yardstick for my own development while making sure I didn't become like the ones we were all collectively judging.
Those lessons akin to walking a tightrope and not dropping the juggling pins - no mistakes, girls! - are the subject of journalist Allison Yarrow's "90s Bitch: Media, Culture and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality." Ms. Yarrow's biting autopsy of the decade scrutinizes the way society reduced - or "bitchified" - women at work, women at home, women in court, even women on ice skates. "The more women assumed power, the more power was taken from them through a noxious popular culture that celebrated outright hostility toward women and commercialized their sexuality and insecurity," Ms. Yarrow writes in the book's opening pages.
Her nonlinear narrative zooms in and out of the decade, highlighting hot topics, news events, real women and fictional television characters to examine the cultural conversation around sexuality, abuse, motherhood, professionalism and even undergarments. Americans in the '90s - amplified by a burgeoning 24/7 cable news landscape and its audiences - loved to talk about the women they hated. Ms. Yarrow recounts society's fascination with the angry bitch (call to mind the headlines about Lorena Bobbitt and TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes), the bad mom bitch (does Roseanne Barr ring a bell?), the damaged bitch (recall "the fallen princess" Diana) and the manly bitch (for which Janet Reno was often a punchline).
It's not that some high-profile women of the '90s didn't do questionable or wrong things - let's take, for example, Courtney Love's reported drug use during pregnancy. It's not that the hammer of public opinion came down on them hard, but that it came down at all. Rock daddies seldom slowed their coke snorting when babies came into the picture, Ms. Yarrow reminds us.
Of course, you can't discuss women in the '90s without mentioning Anita Hill and Monica Lewinsky, and Ms. Yarrow devotes several pages to examining society's treatment of both women. Ms. Yarrow writes that the "old, stale messages that women should fear the sex that men were entitled to persisted in the '90s, despite the decade's lip service to modern ideals . this dichotomy would shape the decade's two biggest sex scandals."
Both women would be chastised, even threatened, throughout their lives for sexual encounters - both uninvited and invited - with men who wielded power over them. Sadly, Ms. Yarrow writes, no one recognized in real time that what happened to Anita Hill was "gallows humor satire of '90s bitchification." Direct quotes from politicians, journalists and comedians about the women provide the most jarring, oh-my-god-that-really-happened portions of Ms. Yarrow's decade excavation.
Conservative writer David Brock (who later turned liberal) famously called Ms. Hill "a little nutty and a little slutty." "Her life is more than a little destroyed, as a result," Ms. Yarrow writes. Anita Hill received death threats and was publicly accused of "erotomania" after coming forward with her story of sexual harassment.
Criticism of Ms. Lewinsky's consensual sexual relationship with the president became a national pastime in the late '90s, and anything was game - her sex life, her size, her undergarments. Ms. Yarrow takes issue that journalism's highest prize was awarded to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in 1999 for her takes on Ms. Lewinsky. In them, she compared Ms. Lewinsky, more than once, to Glenn Close's character in "Fatal Attraction."
This aggressive assailing of women at every turn is why Ms. Yarrow largely describes the '90s as a decade that failed one half of the population. A generation who entered the decade with record numbers in universities and the workplace exited the '90s as contortionists, twisting themselves into what society expected - intelligent but not too opinionated, pretty but not too sexy, sexy but not slutty. Go too far, and you just might be a bitch.

Texto completo: The Ewa Beach couple on a cruise ship in Japan struck by an outbreak of the new coronavirus has finally left the ship and reached the United States, but their troubles aren’t over yet.
Debbie Pagan, 58, and husband Eric, 64, were two of at least six Hawaii residents and nearly 400 U.S. citizens who began a two-week cruise Jan. 20 from Yokohama, Japan, aboard the Diamond Princess.
But on Feb. 4, instead of returning to Yokohama and leaving the ship, the 3,700 passengers and crew members began a 14-day quarantine after learning someone aboard tested positive for the coronavirus, or COVID-19.
And on Saturday evening, four days before the quarantine was set to end, Debbie Pagan and the hundreds of other U.S. citizens learned that they would have to begin another two-week quarantine on a military base in either California or Texas.
“I could feel this, the feeling of suffocating. … At first I was in shock, then I was so disappointed,” Pagan said Sunday. “We were counting down the days.”
The Pagans arrived at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif. around 11:30 p.m. Sunday night after what Pagan called a “nightmare” of a trip that included six hours to get from the ship to Haneda Airport, a nine-hour charter flight to Fairfield and another four hours to arrive at Westwind Inn, an on-base hotel where it appears they will spend the next two weeks.
Some of the problems Pagan mentioned are things any traveler might encounter on a particularly bad trip — missing luggage, hours of waiting and less-than-ideal bathroom situations — and while they try to keep their spirits up, it came on the heels of learning that they would have to endure a second quarantine away from home.
“When we get back to Hawaii, please don’t quarantine us. Everyone has their breaking point,” she said, laughing.
While waiting for what became five hours on a bus from the Diamond Princess to the airport, Pagan said, a passenger had an anxiety attack and had to be assisted.
It is possible that the Pagans were flying with Americans who had tested positive for the coronavirus. A total of 454 passengers on the Diamond Princess had contracted the coronavirus as of Monday.
While the planes to the U.S. were aloft, the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said 14 passengers who had been tested two or three days earlier had positive readings.
U.S. officials, it turned out, had started bringing the passengers home without actually knowing their test results. But because the evacuation had already begun by the time Japanese officials relayed those results, officials decided to let the infected evacuees, who were not yet exhibiting symptoms, board the planes and sit in the back, separated from other passengers by plastic sheets about 10 feet tall.
An email to passengers Sunday from the U.S. Embassy Tokyo said, “Health authorities will screen all passengers prior to allowing them to board the chartered flights. No symptomatic or infected passengers will be allowed to board.”
The Pagans have not shown any signs of having the virus, and Debbie Pagan said she was not aware that she may have been flying with someone who had tested positive until she received a text about it when the plane landed.
“My husband said there was an opening by the tarp in front of us. … He looked through the gap, and he said that he could see four people there,” she said. “The tarp had just blocked off us from whoever was on the other side.”
After a few hours of getting some of their belongings, room keys and food, at around 3:30 a.m. local time, the couple arrived via bus at their two-bedroom unit at the Westwind Inn, where they could be spending their stateside two-week quarantine that Pagan was told started as soon as they landed.
While there, she said, they will get their temperatures taken twice a day and meals given to them. They received a warm welcome from the military and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when they stepped off the plane, but Pagan acknowledged that others could perceive them as sick regardless of their lack of symptoms.
“In their eyes it’s like we’re all infected,” she said, as if “it’s up to you to prove to us that you’ll be ready to go home in 14 days.”
Around noon Monday a military member who brought food and water asked Pagan to put a dining chair outside her front door where food can be placed to avoid any contact and being “contaminated.” Another put water bottles on their windowsill.
They were also instructed not to leave their units for the first 48 hours.
A chain link fence was put around the inn and a large, grassy yard area that the quarantined guests could use, so after those first 48 hours, Pagan and her husband will be able to enjoy the outdoors for the first time in over two weeks.
“It sounds like after 48 hours we’re free to roam around the area, and I told my husband I really miss my running,” she said.
Though her husband was against it, Pagan said she would run with a mask and not make contact with anyone.
Pagan and her husband are born-again Christians, and she has said over the last two weeks that her faith has been instrumental in getting through the quarantine and the sudden changes that it has brought along.
“I’ve got the Lord in my heart, and he knows every day, every day just be with him. Just trust him,” she said Monday. “We’re not going through this all by ourselves and scared.”
But Pagan said Sunday that she is looking forward to returning to Hawaii, getting back to her dog and her grandchildren, and having a “normal life.”
“I know that by walking into (my) living room, now it’s done,” she said. “It’s not that I miss my house, but that (I know) I’m done. All of this is done.”

Texto completo: Don't exempt Maingate
from noise regulations
I am writing to voice my objection to the consideration of the city exempting the section of the city, including the Maingate Night Club, from state noise regulations as reported Dec. 16 in The Morning Call.
The state Liquor Control Board should be allowed to enforce its regulations throughout the city. Noise pollution, particularly from loud music in bars, clubs, cars and residences, is a major issue that residents are asked to endure if they live in the city. To suggest that this particular club or any other club be allowed to disturb residents and assume that the police can effectively control such noise is an undue burden to place on our police force.
The club owners have a very clear solution. They can turn down the volume and/or enhance their sound proofing. If in fact sound proofing cannot control the noise pollution, then they should lose their liquor license. LCB has an effective tool to control the behavior of club owners, and they should be allowed to use it.
The proposed exemption is the subject of a meeting scheduled for 6:15 p.m. Wednesday in Allentown City Council chambers.

A fourth family member
lost to Alzheimer's
Nearly two-thirds (3.5 million) of seniors with Alzheimer's are women. African Americans are twice as likely and Hispanics are about 1.5 times as likely to develop Alzheimer's.
Not to mention that three of the four family members we lost to Alzheimer's disease were women. Women are the epicenter of the Alzheimer's crisis. An estimated 3.5 million women aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's.
As an advocate for the Alzheimer's Association Delaware Valley Chapter, I was fortunate to have recently attended the Alzheimer's in Community Leaders Summit in Florida. I enjoyed the seminar but, for me, it was bittersweet having to return home to bury a fourth family member who passed from Alzheimer's disease complications.
Witnessing each loved one go through the various stages of this disease was overwhelming; you can't stop it or reverse it. You remember your loved one as they once were, and now you see a blank stare looking back at you.

Some gun control
laws are too strict
Much has been written lately concerning the strengthening of our nation's gun laws but little about some of our gun laws being too strict. There should be legitimate reasons for depriving a good citizen of the right to protect himself and his home, but that is not always the case.
A recent example is a district federal court's decision to prohibit the possession of firearms from those convicted of a drunken driving offense. To construct a connection of drunken driving to firearms is a giant leap of logic. Let's turn that thinking around and legislate that anyone convicted of a firearms crime lose their driver's license. Same failure of a relationship.
How can any sensible law dictate a connection of some non-violent crimes such as forgery, fraud, insider trading, etc. to gun ownership. More money is stolen without a gun than with one.
Any person sentenced to house arrest for even a minor violation such as DUI or possession of weed cannot possess a firearm in the home. Nor can his or her spouse, thereby depriving the family of their right of self-defense and home security. Is this fair or reasonable? You decide.

Exploding budget deficit
will harm country
Trump claims that he has created the greatest economy in the history of the United States. Trump and his party are doing tremendous harm to the economy with the explosion of the federal budget deficit.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell recently announced that the Trump $1 trillion plus annual budget deficits are unsustainable. Look at the statistics. Interest on the debt costs almost $350 million a year. This is about half of what is spent on national defense. What happens if interest rates increase? The problem compounds.
Trump was delivered a robust economy by President Obama with declining annual deficits. Trump's reckless policies will do one of two things: bankrupt the country or cause enormous cuts in spending on Medicare and Social Security, which, in my opinion, is the goal of Trump and his party.
For those who believe Trump is the political answer to their prayers, it is about time you do some political homework so you understand the fiscal harm Trump is causing.

Trump should not try
to influence sentencings
The New York Times reported; "Senior Department of Justice officials intervened to overrule front-line prosecutors and will recommend more lenient sentencing for Roger J. Stone Jr."
Donald J. Trump has undermined just about every institution this country stands for. Why is William Barr's Justice Department working as a personal law firm for Donald J. Trump?
Mr. Barr's Justice Department has come up with creative ways to interpret the law. We can only hope Judge Amy Berman Jackson admonishes the interference by Trump and Barr and hands down the original prosecutors' recommended sentence.
Mr. Stone was convicted by a jury of his peers (of seven federal felonies). No American should be in favor of having our Department of Justice corrupted, in order to do Trump's bidding. Trump is not (yet) a king and should not be above the law. Allowing him to behave as such is as anti-American as imaginable.

It was a rough week for America
It was a very rough week. A trial without a trying. A prayer breakfast needing a prayer. A love feast in the East Room. The president's smirk rising like the sun. A perp walk for doing your duty. A perp walk for being a twin.
Save one, Republican senators standing every which way but up. Save one, Republican senatorsunashamedly owning "We are the hollow men. Weare the stuffed men, Leaning together, Headpiece filled with straw." We are in T. S. Eliot's "Waste Land."

Texto completo: Inside a secret government building west of Washington, D.C. - past the armed guards, through the turnstiles and coded locks, into a vaulted office with the highest security clearance - sat the CIA's team of elite programmers.
They had the weighty mission of creating the hacking tools used by the CIA to spy on foreign governments and terrorists. If that job description conjures Hollywood images of serious officers in dark suits huddling over clandestine operations, a different picture emerged during a federal trial in Manhattan this month.
The work culture described by CIA officers on the witness stand more closely resembled comedies like "The Office" or "Silicon Valley" than spy thrillers like "Jack Ryan."
From their cubicles, the programmers sent prank emails, taunted colleagues about their physical appearance and shot each other with Nerf guns and rubber bands, according to trial testimony.
The man on trial, Joshua Schulte, is a former CIA computer engineer who is accused of stealing a massive archive of classified documents and giving them to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization. Schulte, 31, has denied the allegations.
WikiLeaks published the information in 2017, the biggest leak of classified CIA documents in the spy agency's history.
For the past two weeks, Schulte's former colleagues and law enforcement officials have taken the stand to explain a thicket of CIA computer networks, guiding jurors through a digital trail that prosecutors say led to Schulte as the leaker. Testimony will resume Tuesday.
The government charges that Schulte stole the documents to retaliate against his managers, who he believed did not take his workplace complaints seriously.
Multiple CIA witnesses - testifying under pseudonyms or with first names only - have described an office culture at odds with the myth of the agency.
"It may surprise some to discover that we are not the gun-toting, globe-trotting, martini-drinking spies frequently portrayed on the silver screen," the CIA website says, adding that the work of most intelligence officers resembles "any other nine-to-five job in terms of logistics and lifestyle."
The trial testimony has focused on a corner of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, where Schulte worked until his resignation in 2016. Every developer in Schulte's group, which was predominantly made up of men, had top-secret security clearance, one witness testified.
The group worked on classified projects, writing the code that allowed other CIA officers to carry out sophisticated cyber operations and penetrate the computer networks of foreign targets.
Though Schulte's former co-workers said the office was focused on the national security mission, it was also a breeding ground for sophomoric pranks and fights.
One CIA employee, who used the pseudonym Jeremy Weber, testified that once, when he left his computer open, Schulte used it to send a profane message to everyone in their group under Weber's name.
Schulte, who was known for being a difficult colleague, had a particularly strained relationship with another developer, identified only as Amol.
During an argument in early 2016 between the two men, Weber testified that he tried to intervene, telling Schulte to be "the bigger man." Schulte responded, "We all know who the bigger man is," a reference to Amol's weight, according to Weber.
Schulte and Amol filed workplace complaints against each other, with Schulte claiming that Amol had threatened to kill him.
Their CIA supervisor at the time testified last week that an internal investigation found Schulte's accusation to be meritless.

A $425 Million Milk Industry Merger Moves Closer

Texto completo: Dairy Farmers of America agreed to acquire assets from Dean Foods, the bankrupt milk processing company. But regulators must approve the deal first.
It's a hard time to be a dairy farmer in America: The nationwide decline in milk consumption and the rippling effects of the trade war with China have pushed thousands of farms out of business.
Now the industry is a step closer to a major consolidation that some struggling farmers fear could cripple them even further.
In a deal that is likely to draw scrutiny from government antitrust regulators, Dairy Farmers of America, the country's largest milk cooperative, announced on Monday that it had reached an agreement to purchase a "substantial portion" of the bankrupt milk company Dean Foods.
Dairy farmers have argued that a merger would reduce competition and suppress the price of raw milk. But the co-op says its deal will help farmers by guaranteeing that there will be buyers for their milk at a time when milk consumption is declining nationwide.
Under the agreement, Dairy Farmers of America, a farmer-owned co-op, would pay $ 425 million to acquire 44 of Dean Food's facilities, as well as the real estate, inventory and equipment necessary to operate them. To move forward, the deal must be approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing Dean Foods as well as by regulators, who have been investigating the potential merger for months.
So far, much of the antitrust scrutiny has focused on the co-op's evolving role in the American milk business. Two decades ago, Dairy Farmers of America was founded to help small farmers market their raw milk to dairy processing companies like Dean Foods, which prepare milk for distribution to retailers.
But over the years, the co-op, which now has more than 14,000 members, has also invested heavily in processing, meaning it buys some of the raw milk that its own marketing branch sells. Those investments have created a conflict of interest, some dairy farmers argue, because processors benefit from lower milk prices, while farmers benefit from higher ones.
Dean Foods, the largest milk processor in the United States with a little under 60 manufacturing facilities and a portfolio of well-known brands like TruMoo and Lehigh Valley, filed for bankruptcy protection in November, hurt by changing consumer habits and a growing market of milk alternatives.
Dairy Farmers of America's plan to acquire a large portion of Dean Foods' assets would significantly expand its processing operations, heightening the conflict of interest, critics of the merger say.
But not all dairy farmers are opposed. And executives who negotiated the deal argue that bringing together the two milk giants will keep the market stable.
"It is important to ensure continued secure markets for our members' milk and minimal disruption to the U.S. dairy industry," Rick Smith, the chief executive of Dairy Farmers of America, said in a statement on Monday.
The chief executive of Dean Foods, Eric Beringause, said in a statement that Dairy Farmers of America would "serve our customers with the same commitment to quality and service they have come to expect."
The co-op has been discussing a possible acquisition of Dean Foods since shortly before the bankruptcy filing. At the same time, antitrust officials at the Justice Department have been investigating the potential merger, speaking with farmers and the lawyers who represent them about how a deal would affect milk pricing and competition.
In January, a department lawyer sent an email to farmers who sell raw milk to Dean Foods, asking to discuss the merger over the phone.
"We are investigating Dairy Farmers of America's potential acquisition of Dean Foods and the potential loss of competition for selling raw milk," the email said, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
The bankruptcy court in Texas that has overseen the Dean Foods case is scheduled to hold a hearing on March 12 to review the possible acquisition.
The possible Dean Foods deal is not the only source of the antitrust scrutiny facing Dairy Farmers of America. Justice Department officials have also been speaking with the lawyers behind a lawsuit in Vermont that accuses Dairy Farmers of America of engaging in a wide range of anticompetitive practices, including striking deals with other co-ops to not poach one another's members.
The co-op has denied those allegations. But in September, a judge allowed the case to move to trial, writing in her decision that the plaintiffs had presented evidence from which a "rational jury could conclude that the D.F.A. management favored growth of its commercial operations and empire building over the interests of its farmer-members."

Two former Ohio State University football players – 2017 Colerain High School grad Amir I. Riep, 21, and Jahsen L. Wint, 21 – were arrested recently after being accused of raping and kidnapping a 19-year-old woman. Coach Ryan Day dismissed the two from the team.
Columbus police say Riep told the victim to say the encounter was consensual on a video recording.
The idea of seeking "proof" of consent is concerning to sexual violence researchers and prevention advocates for a number a number of reasons. But some criminal defense attorneys say they encourage seeking consent in some sort of documented form, in writing, or an audio or video recording.
Columbus criminal defense attorney Brad Koffel advises his clients to obtain some sort of written consent for sexual acts, even if it's just a text message, and added that any sort of audio or video recording indicating consent is good, too.
"I think the best practice for young men is to ask for consent in writing," he said. "And if they don't, in this climate, then they're going to suffer some consequences."
Earlier this month, attorney for Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is standing trial for rape and sexual assault, made similar suggestions.
"If I was a man in today's world, before I was engaging in sexual behavior with any woman today, I would ask them to sign a consent form," Weinstein's attorney Donna Rotunno said on The Daily, a New York Times podcast.
Although some attorneys view documented consent as a form of protection, Columbus criminal defense attorney Dan Sabol said he would feel concerned if a client obtained written or recorded consent from a sexual partner.
"That'd be a red flag," he said. "It might look as though they're trying to cover their tracks."
Proof of consent might help someone who is falsely accused, he said. But if there is compelling evidence that a sexual act was not consensual, the documentation of consent from a partner could make a suspect appear even more guilty.
"Just because someone says it's consensual on video doesn't make it so," he said.
Brandon Shroy, Columbus criminal defense attorney, said a jury is ultimately responsible for determining the validity of a consent video.
"It's something that defense attorneys – someone who are defending them – would love to see, but it's something a group of jurors would choose to believe or disbelieve," he said.
Sexual assault prevention advocates said they are seeing more instances of people being advised to get "proof" of consent, but warn that formal documentation in writing or video doesn't capture how consent really works.
"It should be taken as a red flag that a person would have enough doubts about whether or not consent was established to...request this type of agreement before or after an encounter," said Laura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. "Because in reality, one of the most important things for people to know about consent is that if you have any doubts, or not sure that you're on the same page with your partner, then the interaction should not move forward with your partner."
Emily Gemar, campus advocacy coordinator for OhioHealth's Sexual Assault Response Network of Central Ohio, said consent can legally be revoked at any time, so written or recorded documentation of consent is in no way representative of an entire sexual encounter.
"If someone consents on a recording one time, it doesn't simply (mean) blanket consent for everything after that," she said.
Experts said such recommendations for consent videos or texts isn't surprising, given the current climate and attention on sexual assaults.
"With the #MeToo Movement and a lot of people in powerful positions having harmed many survivors, I'm sure that there is a move to protect themselves by trying to record consent somehow," Gemar said.
" ... On the one hand, people know that consent is important, but on the other hand, of course, these types of ways of proving consent are concerning," said Zoë Peterson, director of the Sexual Assault Research Initiative at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute, who studies sexual consent, sexual assault, sexual coercion and unwanted sex.
Gemar said she uses the 'FRIES' model to outline the requirements of consent: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, specific.
"A good consensual act or series of events should be active communication the whole time and checking in with their partner," she said. "They should consent and enthusiastically agree the whole time."

Texto completo: A Virginia State Senate committee rejected a proposal to ban assault-style rifles, showing the limits of Democratic efforts to impose restrictive gun-control laws.
A bill that would have banned military-style rifles in Virginia was defeated in the State Senate on Monday, a sign of the limited power of the state's new Democratic majority in enacting the most restrictive elements of its gun-control agenda and a blow to Gov. Ralph Northam's efforts to restrict gun possession.
The prohibition on military-style rifles was the most contentious of a series of gun-control bills making their way through the State Legislature this year and the centerpiece of Democrats' attempts to restrict firearms after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in Virginia Beach last May.
The state is at the heart of a long-simmering debate related to the nation's uneasy accommodation regarding gun laws, with Democrats in the state's urban areas and suburbs supporting gun-control measures, while many rural residents have mounted large gun-rights protests in response.
The assault-weapons bill rejected Monday would have prohibited the sale, purchase, manufacture and most transfers of military-style weapons, as well as large-capacity magazines holding more than 12 rounds. It would have also banned trigger activators, including bump stocks, designed to make weapons simulate automatic machine gun fire.
Four Democrats on the 15-member Senate Judiciary Committee joined six Republicans in voting to send the proposal to a state commission for further study. The measure is likely to be debated again next year, lawmakers said.
The Democrats represent both suburban and urban areas, and each of the lawmakers had supported other gun-control measures this session.
But one of the Democrats, R. Creigh Deeds, said there was discomfort in enacting an outright ban because lawmakers had failed to arrive at a consensus definition of what constitutes an assault weapon despite weeks of negotiations. Mr. Deeds said there remained "a lot of questions" about the definition.
The initial version of the measure would have prohibited all assault-style weapons in the state, which would have required owners to turn them in. But that version was recently overhauled to allow owners to keep their weapons. However, it banned new sales and transfers of assault-style weapons.
On Monday, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group that organized a massive gun-rights rally at the Virginia State Capitol last month, praised the vote on Twitter.
Mr. Van Cleave wrote that the rally, as well as the declaration by more than 100 counties and municipalities across the state as "Second Amendment sanctuaries" had sent a stern political warning to legislators about enacting severe gun restrictions.
"VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Mr. Van Cleave tweeted.
He added in another tweet: "Everybody's hard work, Lobby Day, and sanctuary movement paid off!"
Despite the defeat of the assault-rifle ban, however, both the State Senate and the House of Delegates are poised to give final approval later this month to at least five other gun-control bills.
Those measures include limiting handgun purchases to one each month, requiring background checks for all firearms sales and transfers, and imposing a "red flag" law, which allows the confiscation of guns from people deemed by courts to be dangerous to themselves or others.
Mr. Northam, a Democrat, has said he intends to sign the measures into law.
Mr. Northam's spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement Monday that the governor was "disappointed" by the failure of the assault-rifle ban, but added: "We will be back next year."
Republicans had refused to consider gun-control proposals when they controlled the State Legislature last year, and the issue became one of the central themes for Democratic candidates, who in November won control of both chambers for the first time in 25 years.
During the committee hearing Monday, which was filled with gun-rights supporters, a Marine Corps combat veteran told lawmakers that the M-16 assault rifle -- a military assault-style rifle -- was a critical tool of war, but that such firearms had no place among civilians.
"I had to use this weapon to save my life on multiple occasions on the battlefield -- but when I see civilians carrying them on the streets of our cities, I am brought back to those days of combat, and the unrelenting knowledge of just how lethal they are," said Kyleanne Hunter, who was an AH-1W "Super Cobra" helicopter attack pilot during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But opponents of the prohibition say they fear a ban on assault-style rifles would be a prelude to the government confiscating weapons from law-abiding citizens.
The National Rifle Association cheered the bill's demise, saying that while people who owned assault-style rifles would not have had to surrender their weapons to state authorities, those who possessed high-capacity magazines might have had to turn them in.
"There was no option for citizens to keep their lawfully acquired magazines with capacities greater than 12 rounds, forcing millions of Virginians to dispose of their property, become a criminal, or surrender them to the government," the National Rifle Association said in a statement Monday.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
The mistakes described in "Overloaded Pharmacists Warn They're Making Fatal Mistakes" (front page, Feb. 1) keep me up at night. Even one medication error is too many.
Unfortunately, the current system sets pharmacists up to fail. The weight of the potentially dire consequences of filling the wrong prescription or missing dangerous drug interactions is crushing pharmacists, personally and professionally.
The solution comes from taking a hard look at how pharmacies are reimbursed and who profits from inadequate patient care.
Pharmacy benefit managers make piles of money with no proof they serve patients. They say they keep prices and premiums down but fight efforts to demystify how they achieve this. If it's not greedy, let's see how it works. If it really helps patients, tell us how. But they won't. It's indefensible.
Patient safety must always remain a priority. We need change now.

Klobuchar surge and the media's woman problem

Texto completo: After the Feb. 7 Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire, the New York Times asked 10 of its opinion writers to score the candidates' performances. The hands-down winner: Amy Klobuchar.
But you wouldn't know that from news reports. Across print, digital, broadcast and cable, coverage of the debate overwhelmingly focused on the battle of the bros: Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Klobuchar barely merited a mention. The New York Times itself treated her as a footnote, declaring in a front-page article that "there were no standout moments" in a debate that might be Klobuchar's "final" chance (though the next day it belatedly noted her "Klomentum" – on page A27).
So when Klobuchar finished strong, with a third-place finish closing in on the top two winners, news outlets trumpeted her "sudden surge" as a "big surprise." Actually, no, it wasn't. It was a failure of basic news reporting.
Why the disconnect? The media still have a woman problem. Female candidates routinely get less attention and are taken less seriously than male candidates. A recent Wilson Center study found that "the coverage women in politics receive is still heavily biased against them, both in quantity and in quality." The coverage they do get tends to be more negative: Northeastern University School of Journalism last spring analyzed almost 1,400 news articles from mainstream outlets and found "female candidates running for president are consistently being described in the media more negatively than their male counterparts."
Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. News coverage decisions are overwhelmingly made by men, who lead the vast majority of newsrooms. Women make up two-thirds of journalism and communications grads, yet men write or produce 63% of all news coverage, according to the Women's Media Center. On television, male journalists outnumber female journalists by almost 2 to 1. On Twitter, male political reporters ignore female reporters altogether; they retweet fellow male journalists three times more often than they retweet female journalists.
In other words, the male perspective is the default in the news business. The female is the outlier – which often translates into women simply being ignored. A British analysis concluded that more than 75% of "experts" quoted in digital news accounts are male. In the U.S., more than 70% of Sunday morning politics and policy talk show guests are male. One study of English-language news sites globally found that 77% of those mentioned in articles are men, and that women are "routinely marginalized or 'symbolically annihilated' in the news."
Think about that for a moment: Women are "symbolically annihilated" by the media. Klobuchar isn't the only example of this; she's simply the most recent one. After the Iowa caucus, Elizabeth Warren was "virtually erased" from news coverage despite beating Biden for the third-place spot, Joan Walsh argued in Nation. "I have watched cable news panels mention Warren only in passing, if at all." The issue cuts across political lines. Female journalists started the 19th, a new nonpartisan publication covering the intersection of gender and politics, because women are "underrepresented in politics and policy journalism and in newsroom leadership."
The problem is, the media actually know it's kind of sexist, but can't seem to help itself. When women aren't being ignored in news coverage, they're being pilloried. Back when Hilary Clinton was a presidential contender, coverage by mainstream media outlets was relentlessly gendered. She was "unlikeable." She was an "angry woman." She had "cankles." She was "shrill" and "castrating" and reminded men of their "nagging wives." You would think the media have learned since then to scrub the sexism from its prose. It hasn't. Witness descriptions of Klobuchar as the "boss from hell," and Warren as "unlikeable" and a "moralizing scold."
Clearly, there are other issues at play here beyond gender. Political coverage, like reporting on Hollywood, is by nature pack journalism, populated by an often tight-knit group of reporters who talk with one another, travel with one another and compete for the coveted access to the highly-scripted people they cover. Too often the end result is group think: a mass-derived conventional wisdom that blocks out noncomforming views, and sometimes – as in 2016, when the media missed the rise of Donald Trump – even blinds us to what we are seeing in front of our faces.
We suffer as well from an overreliance on polls. The polls were wrong in 2016, when almost all predicted a Clinton landslide, and there is no evidence that they are any more accurate now. If anything, they may be even less so. Before the Iowa caucus, polls showed Sanders and Biden running neck and neck, with Sanders given the edge. Of course neither won, with Buttigieg besting them both and Biden tanking in fourth place.
None of this is to suggest that Klobuchar will, or won't, continue her "surge." That isn't the point. This is: Her strong finish shouldn't have been a "surprise." Journalism is the first draft of history, which we all know is imperfect – but we can, and must, do better. We need to be cognizant of biases that continue to infect our reporting. We need to move beyond a world where the default newsworthy person is male, the default expert is male, the default leader is male.
Women make up the majority of U.S. voters. It's time they have a proportional say in news coverage, too.

Texto completo: It was a staple of medical thinking dating to the 1910s that stress was the body's alarm system, switching on only when terrible things happened, often leaving a person with an either-or choice: fight or flight.
The neuroscientist Bruce S. McEwen trailblazed a new way of thinking about stress. Beginning in the 1960s, he redefined it as the body's way of constantly monitoring daily challenges and adapting to them.
McEwen, who died on Jan. 2 at 81, described three forms of stress: good stress, a response to an immediate challenge with a burst of energy that focuses the mind; transient stress, a response to daily frustrations that resolve quickly; and chronic stress, a response to a toxic, unrelenting barrage of challenges that eventually breaks down the body.
It was McEwen's research into chronic stress that proved groundbreaking. He and his research team at Rockefeller University in Manhattan discovered in 1968 that stress hormones had a profound effect on the brain.
In studies using animals (five rats in the initial one), McEwen and his colleagues demonstrated that toxic stress atrophied neurons near the hippocampus, the brain's memory and learning center. Their findings also paved the way for a later discovery by other scientists: that toxic stress also expands neurons near the amygdala, an area of the brain that promotes vigilance toward threats.
Describing the burden of continuing stress, McEwen coined the term "allostatic load" (derived from allostasis, the process by which the body seeks to regain stability, or homeostasis, in response to stressors).
Their discoveries, first published in the journal Nature in 1968, ignited a new field of research, one that would reveal how stress hormones and other mediators change the brain, alter behavior and impact health, in some cases accelerating disease.
At the time, only a few scientists were asserting that the brain remains malleable throughout life, challenging the dogma that the brain stops changing after adolescence. McEwen's studies documenting how hormones alter neurons lent credence to this emerging idea.
"Everything in the field of stress bears his intellectual footprint," said Robert Sapolsky, a professor of biology, neurology and neurosurgery at Stanford University and the author of the popular book "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers" (1994).
"The most remarkable thing" about McEwen, he added, in a phone interview, "is that he started off as a cell biologist, with his first paper on muscle biochemistry published in 1959 in Science, and over the last couple of decades his work was more about why crappy childhoods make for adult brains that don't work well."
McEwen discussed allostatic load in 2000 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, writing:
"In anxiety disorders, depressive illness, hostile and aggressive states, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder, allostatic load takes the form of chemical imbalances as well as perturbations in the diurnal rhythm, and, in some cases, atrophy of brain structures.
By the end of his career McEwen had expanded his research to look at the impact of stress on communities, finding that chronic stress disproportionally affected marginalized people and increased their risk of illnesses.
Five years ago, he teamed up with his brother, Craig McEwen, a professor emeritus of sociology at Bowdoin College in Maine, to study the sociological implications of chronic stress.
"We know that environmental complexity changes the brain," Bruce McEwen said, and that it "comes to haunt us in terms of socioeconomic status, poverty and things of that sort."
At his death -- caused by complications of a stroke, a Rockefeller spokeswoman said -- McEwen was the Alfred E. Mirsky professor and head of the Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at the university.
He published more than 1,000 scientific articles, and his work has been cited in others more than 130,000 times. He also wrote popular books, including "The Hostage Brain" (1994), about how the brain can be overtaken by both external and internal forces, written with Harold M. Schmeck Jr., then a science reporter for The New York Times.
He had continued to lecture and write scientific articles (as well as draw and paint) until weeks before his stroke.
Huda Akil, the co-director of the Michigan Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan, said McEwen's thinking had been "absolutely pivotal in key stages of how we think about stress." Akil was a co-author of one of McEwen's final papers. It was published in the Journal of Neuroscience on the day he died.
Bruce Sherman McEwen was born on Jan. 17, 1938, in Fort Collins, Colorado, to George and Esther (Lenters) McEwen. He grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father was an English professor at the University of Michigan; his mother was a homemaker.
After graduating from University High School in Ann Arbor, he attended Oberlin College in Ohio, earning his bachelor's degree in 1959. He received his doctorate from Rockefeller University in 1964 and did postdoctoral research at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden before returning to Rockefeller as a faculty member in 1966.
McEwen often collaborated with his wife, Karen Bulloch, a Rockefeller research associate professor and head of the university's neuroendocrinology and inflammation program.
She survives him, along with his brother; two daughters, Carolyn McEwen and Sarah McEwen Kelly; his stepchildren Kimberly McGrath and Scott Muryasz; and eight grandchildren. An earlier marriage, to Nancy Ames, ended in divorce.

Texto completo: Inside a secret government building west of Washington, D.C. -- past the armed guards, through the turnstiles and coded locks, into a vaulted office with the highest security clearance -- sat the CIA's team of elite programmers.
They had the weighty mission of creating the hacking tools used by the CIA to spy on foreign governments and terrorists. If that job description conjures Hollywood images of serious officers in dark suits huddling over clandestine operations, a different picture emerged during a federal trial in Manhattan this month.
The work culture described by CIA officers on the witness stand more closely resembled comedies like "The Office" or "Silicon Valley" than spy thrillers like "Jack Ryan."
From their cubicles, the programmers sent prank emails, taunted colleagues about their physical appearance and shot each other with Nerf guns and rubber bands, according to trial testimony.
The man on trial, Joshua Schulte, is a former CIA computer engineer who is accused of stealing a massive archive of classified documents and giving them to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization. Schulte, 31, has denied the allegations.
WikiLeaks published the information in 2017, the biggest leak of classified CIA documents in the spy agency's history.
For the past two weeks, Schulte's former colleagues and law enforcement officials have taken the stand to explain a thicket of CIA computer networks, guiding jurors through a digital trail that prosecutors say led to Schulte as the leaker. Testimony will resume Tuesday.
The government charges that Schulte stole the documents to retaliate against his managers, who he believed did not take his workplace complaints seriously.
Multiple CIA witnesses -- testifying under pseudonyms or with first names only -- have described an office culture at odds with the myth of the agency.
"It may surprise some to discover that we are not the gun-toting, globe-trotting, martini-drinking spies frequently portrayed on the silver screen," the CIA website says, adding that the work of most intelligence officers resembles "any other nine-to-five job in terms of logistics and lifestyle."
The trial testimony has focused on a corner of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, where Schulte worked until his resignation in 2016. Every developer in Schulte's group, which was predominantly made up of men, had top-secret security clearance, one witness testified.
The group worked on classified projects, writing the code that allowed other CIA officers to carry out sophisticated cyber operations and penetrate the computer networks of foreign targets.
Though Schulte's former co-workers said the office was focused on the national security mission, it was also a breeding ground for sophomoric pranks and fights.
One CIA employee, who used the pseudonym Jeremy Weber, testified that once, when he left his computer open, Schulte used it to send a profane message to everyone in their group under Weber's name.
Schulte, who was known for being a difficult colleague, had a particularly strained relationship with another developer, identified only as Amol.
During an argument in early 2016 between the two men, Weber testified that he tried to intervene, telling Schulte to be "the bigger man." Schulte responded, "We all know who the bigger man is," a reference to Amol's weight, according to Weber.
Schulte and Amol filed workplace complaints against each other, with Schulte claiming that Amol had threatened to kill him.
Their CIA supervisor at the time testified last week that an internal investigation found Schulte's accusation to be meritless.

Texto completo: She thrust a flyer into the hand of a tall young man who looked annoyed. She promised to give a woman a gift for hearing her out. And she practically wrapped her arms around another woman who bounded away shaking her head, uninterested and impatient.
With each person, Alice Yi offered the same energetic greeting: "Do you know about the census?"
Yi is the chairwoman of the Asian Complete Count Committee in Austin, a volunteer group that partners with the Census Bureau to raise awareness about the census among Asian Americans. And this year, she said, it is more urgent than ever that Asian American communities like the one in Austin -- where Vietnamese American men and women crowded into a ballroom in the middle of a strip mall last month to celebrate the Lunar New Year -- be counted.
Asian Americans are the fastest growing population in the nation. But organizers and activists like Yi, 63, worry that Asian Americans remain largely misunderstood. The population includes people from places as different as Nepal, Iraq, Vietnam and Taiwan, in occupations ranging from store clerk and taxi driver to lawyer and banker. The census, the activists say, is one of the best tools available to help capture that multiplicity, secure better resources and funding and harness untapped political power.
"Asian Americans have been relegated as the sub-minority -- that we're not black, we're not Hispanic," said Gene Wu, a Democratic state representative from Houston who is Chinese American. "For a large part, we're an afterthought."
Yi believes the census could change that, but first more Asian Americans need to be persuaded to complete it.
In a survey, Asian Americans reported a lower likelihood of filling out their census forms than any other demographic group. They are also the least familiar with the census, on average, and the most worried that their information will be used against them, according to a Census Bureau report.
As the count draws nearer, a mass mobilization encouraging Asian Americans to participate in the census is underway. Hundreds of civic organizations are sending volunteers to knock on doors, visit cultural fairs and host town halls in an effort to educate Asian Americans about the existence of the census, and to allay fears about completing it.
Over the past year, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, a nonpartisan community mobilization organization, has trained more than 750 local groups in how to do census outreach in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, also called AAPI.
The number of Asian Americans grew by more than 25% from 2010 to 2017, according to census estimates. Two-thirds of Asian Americans were born abroad, by far the largest share of any major racial or demographic group (Latinos are second at one-third), according to an analysis of census figures by AAPI Data, a demographic and policy research group.
That most Asian Americans are foreign-born, and many are recent arrivals with limited English, only makes reaching them harder. AAPI Data estimates that just under one-third of Asian immigrants arrived in the United States within the last 10 years, and thus have little or no prior experience with the census.
In a second-floor apartment on Austin's South Side, Deva Raja Neupane sat one morning with a few of the nine Nepalese men who share the three-bedroom unit, explaining the importance of the census. The men were all clerks at convenience stores or gas stations, working to send money to their families in Nepal.
One of the men, Dil Bahadar Oli, 22, who came to America a year ago as a refugee, said he had concerns about giving personal information for the census. After Neupane, a Nepali activist, explained the details and purpose of the count, Oli said he would be comfortable taking part if his Nepalese friends and relatives who have been in the United States longer were doing the same.
"If you reach them, it's not that hard," Neupane said afterward.
There are dozens of Asian languages, and more than one-third of Asian Americans speak limited English. While the online census forms are offered in five Asian languages, and the Census Bureau is publishing informational guides in about two dozen Asian languages, activists say they are concerned that the bureau has slashed the number of Asian languages in which it will advertise.
They are also worried that paper census forms are available only in Spanish and English. The Census Bureau has made a push to get most people to fill out the questionnaires online this year, but some activists say that it will be difficult for most marginalized communities with poor internet access to do so.
Asian-Americans Advancing Justice Atlanta, a legal advocacy organization, has created a website with information about the census in 18 Asian languages. It plans to set up locations in the Atlanta area, equipped with computers and tablets, where Asian Americans can fill out the census with the help of people who look like them.
In Austin, the Asian American population has been doubling in size every 12 years or so, and this year is expected to surpass black residents as the third largest group in the city, after white and Latino residents. Austin ranks among the 10 U.S. cities with the largest share of Asian Americans in their populations.
Yi, who emigrated from Xinjiang in western China four decades ago, has been making the rounds feverishly at community meetings, cultural events and house parties to spread the word about the census in the area. She said she encountered plenty of skepticism about the necessity and safety of giving information to the government.
Federal law protects the confidentiality of personal information that respondents provide to the Census Bureau, but Yi said many Asian Americans are nervous anyway. The Trump administration's proposal to add a citizenship question to the census created anxiety and confusion that has lingered, she said, even though the Supreme Court blocked the proposal.
Tashi Phuntsok, an Austin restaurant owner who is Tibetan and Nepalese and has been in the United States for 25 years, said he would fill out the census because he felt that representation was important for people like him. Still, he worried about the possibility that the census could help the government locate and target particular ethnic groups, pointing to the internment of Japanese Americans in camps during World War II.
"Is it a good thing or a bad thing? I don't know," he said of the census. "Concerns are there. It's a two-edged sword."

Texto completo: CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Robbie O'Han was supposed to spend his last year of organized basketball playing mostly against prep schools and junior colleges.
Instead he got called up to one of the most storied teams in college hoops, the North Carolina Tar Heels, after spending three seasons with its junior varsity team, whose very existence is unknown to a majority of fans.
The Tar Heels are one of only a few universities to maintain a JV team, a hierarchy far more common in American high schools than in Division I, where the best programs mostly run single teams made up of scholarship recruits, top players with NBA aspirations and a few walk-ons.
In September, O'Han got an irresistible offer to move up the chain from Hubert Davis, an assistant coach with the Tar Heels. The main team was down to one healthy point guard, Cole Anthony, and needed another before the season started in November.
"I was going to have three weeks to practice with the team and then they were going to decide if they wanted me to stay on the team or go back down to JV," O'Han said. "And they decided to keep me."
Since being called up, O'Han, who is 6 feet, 3 inches and 21 years old, has played in eight games, albeit in a down season for one of the blue bloods of college basketball. In eight games, he has a total stat line of one rebound, one steal, one turnover, and one foul, with eight minutes played.
When he entered a 94-71 victory over Miami on Jan. 25, O'Han was greeted with a raucous round of applause from the home crowd and a mention from the ESPN announcers on the television broadcast.
"I was just focused on going in and I was so excited that we were winning by 30," O'Han said. "We really needed the win, so I didn't really notice what the fans were doing, but afterward people were telling me that the fans were going crazy, so that was definitely cool to hear."
Though rare in college basketball, the JV team has been something of a pipeline for North Carolina. O'Han is one of two former JV players on the current roster, along with Caleb Ellis, a graduate student who played in 19 games last season for the school's primary team.
The NCAA does not keep track of JV teams nationally, and North Carolina is the only school in the Atlantic Coast Conference with one. Only a handful of Division I universities have a JV team.
The JV team at North Carolina began as a freshman team, at a time when scholarship freshmen were not allowed to play during their first year in college under NCAA rules. That changed in 1972, but North Carolina coach Dean Smith kept the JV team in place to give regular students a chance to be around North Carolina basketball while also letting potential walk-ons learn the varsity system.
When the rules changed, most other universities across the nation disbanded their freshman teams. Kansas once had one that was coached for eight seasons by North Carolina's current coach, Roy Williams. The team has since disbanded, but it was also led previously by Kentucky coach John Calipari and Maryland coach Mark Turgeon.
"More teams used to have JVs," said Tom Konchalski, a longtime New York City basketball historian and recruiting expert. "But there really aren't that many that have it any longer."
O'Han said most of the JV players stopped playing after two years. He said that Davis, the JV coach the previous three seasons, "made exceptions for guys that he believed had a chance at making varsity."
"When I was in high school, I was getting looked at by mainly DII and DIII schools," O'Han said. "I grew up in Raleigh, so I knew about the JV program at UNC and I knew some guys who had gone through it. From what I heard, it was a tryout and any college student could go and try out. So I chose to go to UNC instead of playing basketball elsewhere just as a general college student."
The JV team plays nearly all of its games in the Dean Smith Center, attracting maybe a few hundred fans about three hours before the varsity team packs the nearly 22,000-seat arena.
"You got great seats, everybody's at center floor," said O'Han's father, Rob O'Han Sr. "You can hear everything."
The team plays a mix of teams from community colleges and other JV programs, and prep schools filled with players who are just out of high school and looking to focus their development in the sport.
Under current head coach Brad Frederick, an assistant coach for Williams, the North Carolina JV team was 7-4 before a game scheduled Saturday against Central Carolina Community College before the varsity team lost to Virginia.
"We play the prep schools and we try to keep it close but we usually get beat," O'Han said after watching a recent game that was part of a three-game losing streak to prep schools. "But those are always the most fun games because we get to compete at a higher level."
Lee Martin, the coach at Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham said his team plays the North Carolina JV squad every season (their game is scheduled for Feb. 25). "It's one of my favorites games of the year," Martin said. "It gives our guys an invaluable experience."
Martin said that experience included not only playing in the Dean Smith Center, but also getting to use its visiting locker rooms. The North Carolina JV players use a separate, smaller locker room from its varsity team. ("It's in a different section, it's not as nice," O'Han said.)
For Frederick, coaching the JV players helps prepare him for a bigger head coaching job. He said one of the toughest challenges comes on game days when he has to coach in one game, and then quickly transition to assisting in another.
"One of the hardest parts about it is trying to let go of the JV game immediately," Frederick said. "So I had the Miami scout for instance, and now the JV game is over and you've got to forget about what happened in the JV game and focus on turning your attention to getting ready for Miami or whoever you're playing."
O'Han was essentially brought up to be an extra body during practice for a varsity team that has been hit hard by injuries this season.
"They were low on numbers," said O'Han, who generally practices on the scout team against the players who are part of the regular rotation.
He spent the early part of the season guarding Anthony, the freshman point guard who was a McDonald's All-American and is a projected top-10 pick in the upcoming NBA draft.
"I was guarding Cole every day, which was definitely a challenge," he said. "That was another really cool part about being on the team."
Anthony had knee surgery in December and missed 11 games, one of many players who has missed time for North Carolina.
O'Han will most likely be finished with basketball after this season. He is majoring in business and after interning last summer at SunTrust Bank, plans to work as an investment banker after graduation.

Texto completo: She won 82 L.P.G.A. tournaments, 13 of them majors, dominating the tour in the late 1950s and much of the 1960s.
Mickey Wright, who won 82 L.P.G.A. tournaments, 13 of them majors, and was perhaps the finest player in the history of women's golf, died on Monday in Florida. She was 85.
The cause was a heart attack, her lawyer, Sonia Pawluc, told The Associated Press. Wright had been hospitalized for the last few weeks after being injured in a fall.
A long hitter known for her compact and fluid swing, Wright dominated the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour in the late 1950s and much of the 1960s. She was eclipsed in career victories only by Kathy Whitworth's 88 and in major-tournament victories only by Patty Berg's 15.
Wright won both the United States Women's Open and the L.P.G.A. Championship four times, and she captured the Western Open three times and the Titleholders Championship twice when they were major events.
She was named the Woman Athlete of the Year by The Associated Press in 1963, when she won 13 L.P.G.A. tournaments, still a record for a single season, and in 1964, when she won 11 times.
Wright, in 1961 and '62, Bobby Jones, in 1930, and Tiger Woods, in 2000 and '01, are the only golfers to have captured four consecutive majors.
Wright's three women's major victories in a single year (she won the United States Women's Open, the L.P.G.A. Championship and the Titleholders in 1961) have been equaled only by Babe Zaharias (1950), Pat Bradley (1986) and Inbee Park (2013).
In December 1999, a six-member panel assembled by The A.P. voted Wright the top women's golfer of the 20th century, ahead of Zaharias and Whitworth.
Ben Hogan was often quoted as saying that Wright "had the finest golf swing I ever saw."
"She was the best I've ever seen, man or woman," Whitworth said in an interview for ESPN in 2015. "I've had the privilege of playing with Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and all of them. And some of our ladies had wonderful golf swings. But nobody hit it like Mickey, just nobody."
Wright spoke of a competitive fire that complemented that form.
"The great winners in golf -- Hogan, Nicklaus, Jones, you might have to think about Tiger Woods -- they were all great swingers, but their inner drive was off the charts, too," she told Sports Illustrated in 2000. Asked if she would include herself in that list, she replied, "Yes, I would."
Wright captured five straight Vare trophies for lowest scoring average on the tour (1960 to 1964) and she twice shot L.P.G.A.-record rounds of 62. She was inducted into L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame in 1964 and the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1976.
"She sort of revolutionized golf for us because she was so good and her swing was so perfect," Betsy Rawls, who won eight majors, told The A.P. in 2006. "Even though we were competitors, she was a joy to watch."
Wright described her swing in the 1962 (and reprinted) instructional "Play Golf the Wright Way."
"I could hit it so well," she told The New York Times in a 2012 telephone interview. "I used to say the second-greatest feeling in the world was a high 2-iron to a well-trapped green."
Asked about the greatest feeling, she replied: "Winning."
Mary Kathryn Wright was born on Feb. 14, 1935, in San Diego and was introduced to golf by her father, Arthur, a lawyer and a weekend player.
By age 14, immersed in golf lessons, she had begun developing her swing, keeping her wrist cocked as long as possible as she addressed the ball and staying away from an emphasis on arm motion, something that most women of the era used, resulting in relatively short drives and iron play.
"I swung the club," she told ESPN. "That's it. The key word is swing, not turn. Not ground your feet like they were in cement so your body doesn't move. That's not a swing to me."
She had an imposing physique even in her teens -- she was 5 feet 9 and 150 pounds in her prime -- and, as she told Time magazine in 1963: "The kids at school called me Moose. I had a terrible inferiority complex. I needed something to show my prowess. Golf was it."
Wright won the U.S. Girls' Junior Championship at age 17. She attended Stanford University for one year, majoring in psychology, and flourished in amateur events before turning pro late in 1954, having been tutored by the teaching professional Harry Pressler. She won the Open and the L.P.G.A. Championship in 1958 and became the No. 1 figure in the women's game.
Except for a brief retirement in the mid-1960s, she played regularly on the tour until 1969. She captured her last tour victory in 1973.
Living in retirement in Port St. Lucie, Fla., Wright seldom made public appearances in her later years.
"I don't hide out, put on sunglasses and pull a cap down when I go out or anything like that," she told Golf World in 2000. "I just like life simple."
When the United States Golf Association Museum in Far Hills, N.J., held a private preview in May 2012 unveiling its Mickey Wright Room to display some 200 of her artifacts, the first time it had honored a women's golfer with a gallery, she did not attend, citing burdens of traveling from her home, though she sent a note of appreciation.
But she took a particular interest in the careers of the youngest female golfers on the national scene and corresponded with Lucy Li, a Californian, in the wake of her qualifying for the United States Women's Open in 2014 at the record age of 11.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
When Wright played in the L.P.G.A. Sprint Senior Challenge in Daytona Beach, Fla., in 1994, finishing second and winning $ 30,000 -- her largest paycheck ever -- some 100 competitors who had completed their rounds followed her around the course.
Later that year, she was the honoree of Jack Nicklaus's Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, and she reflected on the years when the L.P.G.A. was a fledgling endeavor.
"We didn't play golf for much money in the 1950s and 60s but that wasn't important," The Columbus Dispatch quoted her as saying. "We laid out the courses, set the pins, made the pairings, did the statistics and clinics and still managed to play a little golf."

Texto completo: The last time she heard from her family was over three years ago, before China began rounding up Muslims in the country's far west. She lived abroad and knew nothing of her family's fate -- until the contents of a leaked government document surfaced, describing their lives in chilling detail.
Rozinisa Memettohti, an ethnic Uighur who has lived in Turkey since 2003, learned in the document that two of her sisters had been sent to indoctrination camps for having more children than the region allowed. One of the sisters was also targeted for obtaining a passport.
"The reality is already far worse than any of my fears," Ms. Memettohti said in a telephone interview this month. "My father, my brothers and my sisters are in danger."
For the past few years, the authorities in the Xinjiang region have placed hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim minority groups into indoctrination camps in the most sweeping mass detentions since the Mao era. The document provides a rare, finely grained view of how the ruling Communist Party has carried out the system of detentions that has shredded the fibers of society in Xinjiang.
The leaked document, a 137-page spreadsheet, outlines information that the authorities in Karakax County (also spelled Qaraqash) in southwestern Xinjiang have gathered on its residents. It includes the names and government identification numbers of more than 300 people held in indoctrination camps and information on hundreds of their relatives and neighbors. Even children as young as 16 were closely monitored for signs of what Beijing considered to be wayward thinking.
The document, one of numerous files kept on the more than one million people who have been detained in the camps, shows the range of behaviors that the authorities see as problematic that would be normal elsewhere, such as giving up alcohol, wanting to go on a religious pilgrimage or attending a funeral.
In Ms. Memettohti's case, her sisters were flagged for praying regularly and participating in routine religious ceremonies.
The spreadsheet adds to a growing body of evidence on these detentions. Reports on other leaked government documents last year by The New York Times and a group of outlets led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists showed the coercive nature of the crackdown and detailed the tight controls placed on detainees in the indoctrination camps.
The latest government document was leaked last year, and overseas Uighur activists shared it with several news media organizations, including The Times.
The data in it shows how China has tried to establish dominance over Uighurs and other minority groups in the name of increasing security, said Adrian Zenz, a researcher who has analyzed the spreadsheet.
"This document is by far the most detailed that we have," said Mr. Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington. "It allows us to dissect the anatomy of both the internment drive and what the government now is now doing with these people."
Mr. Zenz said he was confident that the document was legitimate for a number of reasons. He said he had matched the identities of 337 listed detainees, relatives and neighbors with other government documents, spreadsheets and a leaked database from SenseNets, a Chinese surveillance company, that included GPS coordinates along with names, identification numbers, addresses and photos.
He also said that he had located three of the internment sites listed in the document based on previously identified camps, and that the language used in the spreadsheet mirrored that of official documents elsewhere in Xinjiang.
The Chinese government says that its policies in Xinjiang are intended to curb terrorism and separatism, and that the camps provide instruction in Chinese language and other skills to people who might be susceptible to extremist ideas.
But the Karakax spreadsheet shows how officials have monitored minute details of daily life to find targets for detention as Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party boss in Xinjiang, ordered officials to "round up everyone who should be rounded up."
The authorities scrutinized three generations of each detainee's family, as well as their neighbors and friends. Officials in charge of monitoring mosques reported on how actively the residents participated in ceremonies, including the naming of children, circumcision, weddings and funerals.
The list specified whether detainees learned about religion from parents and grandparents or elsewhere. Dozens were listed as having a "heavy religious environment" at home -- a designation that was often followed by a recommendation that they not be released.
The authorities also studied how many times a day detainees prayed and whether they took part in -- or were even interested in -- religious pilgrimages.
Outward signs of piety were also recorded. "Wore a beard from March 2011 to July 2014," reads a description of one detainee related to several people who had been sent to camps. Officials categorized as "trustworthy" another man, the father of two detainees, who had cut off his beard and started drinking alcohol after a year of abstaining.
The entries offer detailed explanations of why officials ordered each person to be sent to a camp -- information that has previously mostly trickled out through accounts by former detainees and activists.
Officials dissected their movements or plans to travel, particularly to predominantly Muslim nations. Even obtaining a passport was flagged, regardless of whether it was used. One of the most common reasons cited for detention, little known until now, was the violation of China's birth restrictions by having too many children.
Some detainees were sent to indoctrination camps for crimes like drug sales or domestic violence. Others were put into camps because they had previously served prison time, including one man who finished his sentence nearly two decades ago.
The document lists cases that begin in 2017, when the mass incarceration program started in earnest under Mr. Chen, the party leader in Xinjiang. The latest listed entry is dated March 2019.
Mr. Zenz, who studied the spreadsheet, calculated that about three-fourths of the listed detainees had been released. That appears to be in line with assertions by officials in Xinjiang last year that they had begun winding down the program.
But the document shows that many of those released from the camps were later assigned work in tightly controlled industrial parks, and at least one person went into such work while remaining in detention. Some former inmates have described a system of forced labor in which they have been required to work for little or no pay after their release.
The spreadsheet also indicates that detainees are closely monitored after leaving the camps and ordered to participate in government-organized neighborhood activities. It makes clear that people could be sent to detention camps if their family members demonstrated attitudes the authorities deemed problematic, and that such a factor would affect the prospect of their later release.
"This person had many family members imprisoned and involved in many cases, and his thinking has been infected by extremism," read the notes on one detainee. Officials recommended that he be kept in the camp under strict control.
Yet even as the document showed the extent of surveillance and monitoring in Xinjiang, it also revealed some gaps in the gathering of data.
Ms. Memettohti's name appears in the list under entries on her two sisters, who were detained and are thought to have been released. She is described as living in Turkey in one entry, but not in the other. She also said that the date of her arrival in Turkey was incorrect.
But what she found more surprising was that the authorities had detained her sister Patem, whom she said was active in the local government and had served as the head of the local women's association.
"I felt she would always be the safest one," Ms. Memettohti said.

Texto completo: In 2018, Pam Tanowitz choreographed T.S. Eliot's "Four Quartets," with an original score by Kaija Saariaho and a scenic design that incorporates paintings by Brice Marden. It was the 75th anniversary of the publication of Eliot's four meditations on time and spiritual transience written at the start of World War II.
The premiere, which included actress Kathleen Chalfant ("Angels in America," "Wit") reading Eliot's four poems, took place that summer at Bard College, and the response was of extravagant praise for every element of the collaboration, though most of all for Tanowitz's dance.
In his New York Times review, Alastair Macaulay found it "the greatest creation of dance theater this century." Last May, the work traveled to London and to equally rapturous response.

It is that admirable. "Four Quartets" was revived for only a third time by CAP UCLA with two performances Saturday night and Sunday afternoon at Royce Hall. I saw the matinee.
The movement by Tanowitz, a choreographer's choreographer long known to East Coast dance aficionados but barely on the radar of the larger dance public (the London "Four Quartets" was the first time her work has been seen outside the U.S), has a suppleness that is usually unexpected and never uninviting.
Everything sounds good. Saariaho's incandescent score for string quartet and harp -- superbly played by members of the Knights and given a resplendent amplified sound design by Jean-Baptiste Barriere -- dazzles in its intensity. Chalfant reads Eliot's sublime stanzas with a restrained elegance such that each reaches the listener as a marvel of imagery.
Speaking of imagery, everything looks just as good. Clifton Taylor turns Marden's Minimalist paintings into a luminously lit scrim, backdrop and set of panels around which dancers perform.
No art form, here, competes with the other, and that even includes the diaphanous costumes by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung. The pale pastels blend effortlessly with Marden's bold primary colors and transparency enhances dancers' movements. The lighting, also by Taylor captures the soul of illumination.
Most important and most impressive of all, nothing competes with or makes an unenviable effort to find meaning in a text that stuffed with it. "Four Quartets" by Eliot goes deep. "Four Quartets" by Tanowitz, et. al., is thankfully and magnificently superficial.
There may be little about "Four Quartets" that is danceable, but its lines dance off the page when read with Chalfant's unerring lilt. Eliot creates a seeable sense of place, each poem has both a specific and otherworldly setting. Stillness is evoked in a hundred ways. "There could be no dance, and this is only dance," Eliot writes early on in the first poem, "Burnt Norton," as he tries to go beyond poetry with poetry.
Miraculously, Eliot seems, 75 years later, to speak directly to us. "Distracted from distraction by distraction," he writes, as though yesterday, "Filled with fancies and empty of meaning." Or: "Not here the darkness, in this Twittering world" (the capital T, mine).
In this Beethoven year celebrating the composer's 250th anniversary, when practically every composer is asked to have a dialogue with Beethoven, Eliot demonstrates how he could, with a brilliant intentionality, shape his "Four Quartets" as though they were late Beethoven quartets. Christopher Walken, of course, quotes Eliot in the 2012 film "A Late Quartet."
Tanowitz has said in interviews that she visited the British locations Eliot describes to get a feel for them, but she steers clear of any illustration. The same goes for all the contributors. What that means is they steer clear of Eliot's own intentions.
The poet seduces us into the very essence of being, taking in what was then fashionable Asian thought about how all we can know is of the present as it is lived. He wrote during a very real crisis of faith in humanity at time of unparalleled destruction. For him, redemption is, controversially, found necessarily in Anglican prayer. Appropriation of Hinduism, quantum physics and all else is disapprobation.
The dance begins with a long abstract solo, expressive but, opposite of Eliot's manner, not insistent upon anything specific. A man enters. Relationships in duos, and later ensembles, remain indistinct and, because of that, of lasting interest. Throughout the 75-minute performance, Tanowitz's outstanding company serves to add to Eliot not interpret. Complexity grows upon complexity.
After a dazzling harp introduction, Saariaho's score doesn't really get going until the second poem, "East Coker," with long passages of spectral harmonics, vibrating and "twittering" (not to poetic birdsong or anything else). Marden's paintings, made over the last nearly four decades, are marvelously what they are. No more and no less, but spiritual, for sure, while hinting toward Eastern religion.
In the third poem, "Dry Savages," music and dance come closest to amplifying Eliot, climaxing as the poet begins to reach for revelation. In the last poem, "Little Gidding," named for a 17th century Anglican community, Eliot, living in terror of Nazi bombing, finds Western civilization only savable from fire by fire, namely Christ.
There is no fire for this stage. Music and dance take on the character of dirge. Eliot stops with: "And the fire and the rose are one." Musicians and dancers stop as they are, not one but many.
In the end, movement, light, music and text are all surfaces in this "Four Quartets" that prevent Eliot's words from congealing. Those words are taken on their word, standing on their own, becoming their own kind of theater.
Eliot used modernity to reject modernity. But rejecting Eliot's rejection of poetry and even further rejecting Eliot's reasoning and orthodoxy, this exceptional response to "Four Quartets" achieves genuine universality and profound nowness.

Texto completo: Times art critic Christopher Knight has won the Dorothea and Leo Rabkin Foundation's lifetime achievement award, which comes with a $50,000 prize.
This is the second time the foundation, based in Portland, Maine, has given a lifetime achievement award. The first went to Roberta Smith, the New York Times co-chief art critic, in 2019.
Knight has been an art critic at The Times since 1989. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism in 1991, 2001 and 2007, and he received the National Arts and Entertainment Journalism Award for art and design criticism last year.

Knight was selected for the lifetime achievement honor by a committee at the Rabkin Foundation. Executive Director Susan C. Larsen said she has long admired Knight's work.
"He was always the one who chose the important things and wrote in detail and beautifully," Larsen said. "The most outstanding thing about his career, that lifts him and distinguishes him across the country, is his fearlessness. He's not afraid to tackle the issues everyone talks about."
The Rabkin Foundation was created in 1999, receiving a bequest from the estate of Leo Rabkin, an artist who with wife Dorothea collected American folk and outsider art. The foundation began awarding $50,000 prizes to visual art journalists across the country in 2017 based on nominations. Times staff writer Carolina Miranda was among the eight inaugural winners.
Knight was a critic at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner from 1980 to '89, but he began his career as an art historian and curator.
"It occurred to us that there were a few names that were so major and so obvious that they weren't getting nominated," Larsen said. "We asked ourselves, why did someone not nominate Roberta Smith or Christopher Knight? And I think it was that they were kind of in another category."

Texto completo: Readers respond to an Op-Ed calling on parents to support healthy cafeteria food instead.
To the Editor:
Re "Let the Lunch Lady Feed Your Kids" (Op-Ed, Feb. 12):
Kudos to Jennifer Gaddis for her insightful Op-Ed about school meals. They have indeed improved, and in many places across the country, farm-to-school programs and innovative partnerships between schools and chefs have produced outstanding, appealing fresh food. Many school systems still have a long way to go, but Ms. Gaddis is right that the more families who participate, the better the meals can become.
It is partly simple arithmetic: The larger the number of participants, the lower the unit cost of producing each meal, freeing resources to improve the quality.
Further, schoolwide participation means that school food can be integrated into the curriculum. Given the alarming continued rise in obesity, we urgently need to harness the "cafeteria classroom" to teach our youngsters about healthy food.
Ms. Gaddis points out that more participation would also mean more jobs. These are precisely the kinds of jobs that many parents, especially single parents, need. Jobs on the school calendar are a great boon to people struggling to fulfill both the child care and the breadwinner roles.
I'd like to see universal free school meals nationwide. Let the lunch lady feed all our kids.

To the Editor:
Increased investment in school lunches should be not just about the food, but also the process by which it's served. Part of the reason my little boy, who goes to a great public school in Manhattan, doesn't like school lunch is that his lunch period is short, and the lunch line eats into it substantially. He'd rather pull out his bag and immediately sit down with his friends. If the line moved faster, we might be able to get him to eat what's offered more often. But meals are about more than just eating.

To the Editor:
I would love to stop packing lunch and snacks for my children in kindergarten, but the reality of free breakfast and lunch at their public school in Manhattan is far from the well-balanced offerings cited in this article. Before I banned all school food for my kindergartners, they helped themselves to apple juice and a white bread bagel for breakfast, chocolate milk and a honey corn muffin for lunch, and more juice and honey graham crackers for afternoon snack. All offered on the same day. More sugary beverages and simple carbohydrates than they'd normally consume at a birthday party!
Children in poverty rely on the free offerings from the schools to support their daily nutritional needs. We do them and our neighbors a disservice by not offering the healthy school lunch options that Jennifer Gaddis reports are available elsewhere.
Marta Peimer
New York
To the Editor:
As a middle-class mother of four who would need to spend $ 61 a week ( $ 3.05 a meal) if I allowed my children to get school lunch, I found Jennifer Gaddis's claim that my "actions reduce the political will and financial resources necessary to make public school lunches better for everyone" quite narrow-minded.
I would absolutely support a universal school meals program, but suggesting that by sending homemade lunches I am not doing my part for this cause is insulting and economically elitist. Her article stated that if only parents participated in the school lunch program, then items such as grass-fed beef would be more readily available. I beg to differ, and I do not intend to spend more than $ 240 a month on school lunches to find out.
Elena Capofari

To the Editor:
I appreciate much of what Jennifer Gaddis writes here. But when an argument centers on the "sustainability" of a beneficial program, it loses weight when it does not also address the environmental impacts at play.
Packing lunches provides the option to use reusable containers. Even though the school lunch trays shown in these photos are paper, the photos still display several forms of single-use plastics. It is high time we start challenging the normalization of these products in our lives and urge the standardization toward greener alternatives.
Yes, we have a responsibility to push for healthy (and free!) school lunches for our children, but it cannot be at the cost of our planet -- especially when there is room to advocate for both.

Texto completo: Monitor columnist
One day, Becky Bonner might be the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question.
Name the first female general manager in NBA history. Wait. Let's revise that. The first female GM for any big-league North American sports team, be it basketball, baseball, hockey or football.
Ever.
If she's hired one day – and there's a strong possibility that she will – the answer will be the kid who played at Concord High School. Now she's the director of player development and basketball operations for the NBA's Orlando Magic, whose front office has said they have plans – big plans, historic plans – for Bonner in their future.
Her duties now include everything, short of lugging around that portable steamer thing at home games and yelling “hot dogs, here!” And, as many of you know, when it comes to the Bonner family, Becky would have had sold more hot dogs than anyone else.
For now, even without the GM title, she's highly respected, sitting in on meetings, discussing draft picks and evaluating players.
“I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had, no matter what happens next,” Bonner said by phone from Orlando. “I was an athlete. I was very competitive, so any vertical move at this point is a goal that makes sense.”
Vertical means the GM spot.
Reports came out three years ago that Bonner would get a chance. Jeff Weltman, the Magic's President of Basketball Operations, was quoted as saying Bonner had “unlimited potential.”
Another report said that Bonner's official title was director of player development and quality control, but it was no secret that the Magic saw her moving up.
Bonner, meanwhile, knows what she wants and is reaching for it. It's a Bonner family thing, a confidence-minus-the-arrogance thing.
“Becky does not want to be presumptuous,” said her mother, Paula Bonner, a longtime Concord educator. “She feels like she wants to learn all operations and management work, and she thinks that may work toward (the GM role) happening.”
Paula, who's 6-foot-2, is the matriarch in a family of tall, talented people. Her husband, retired postal worker Dave Bonner, is 6-foot-9. Her brother Matt Bonner is 6-10 and won two NBA championships with the San Antonio Spurs during his 12-year career. He does TV work for the Spurs and runs clinics here, in his hometown.
Her other brother, Luke Bonner, is 7-feet and played big-time college ball and later emerged as a pioneer as college players sought payment for the use of their image in video games.
The boys prepared Becky well. She played on boys' teams through middle school. She showed her creativity while playing Matt one-on-one on the family driveway, grabbing a Whiffle-Ball Bat to aid in her defense, swinging, reaching, adapting.
At 6-foot-2, she dominated the opposition at Concord High, got a scholarship to Stanford University and later starred at Boston University.
She played a year of pro ball in Sweden, and served as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland and the University of Louisville.
She worked in the NBA's New York City headquarters and traveled with the men's Olympic Team and its legendary coach, Mike Krzyzewski, helping where she could while promoting the sport, the NBA and its stars, and playing defense against such players as Kevin Durant in practice.
She worked for NBA-sponsored Basketball Without Borders, ran clinics and promoted the sport around the world. In Brazil, South Africa, China, Finland, Spain.
The Magic hired her in 2017. “For me,” Bonner said, “it's been a natural and easy transition.”
Paula mentioned Becky's strong desire to be part of something bigger than herself. “She enjoyed men's basketball with the Olympics and working with Coach K,” Paula said, referring to the Duke coach, who has more wins than anyone in college basketball history. “She's very excited about the camaraderie and the feeling of being a part of a team again.”
Howard Beck, formerly the NBA writer for the New York Times, did a big spread on Bonner shortly after she arrived in Orlando. Even then, this thing was bubbling.
“Unofficially,” Beck wrote for Bleacher Report, “she's training to become a general manager.”
One report said Orlando had struck gold, shortly after Bonner joined the team. Secret gold. She quickly implanted herself into the Magic culture and did a little hocus pocus herself, which was part of a revamping process the team had envisioned.
There was a plan in place. Make the organization more professional with improvements at the arena. Make it more family-friendly, add some class.
“Our family room, we call it our living room,” Bonner said. “There's an easy way to enter and get food and leave your kids with a babysitter. Having this inclusive family makes everyone's life better and busy over the course of 82 games.”
She's carved out some of her own contributions, and her list of duties could stretch across a basketball court. She helped coordinate renovations at the arena and hired a chef and a nutritionist. She arranges player appearances for kids, organizes team meals, runs errands.
As Bonner said, “It evolved into a service-based role. My job is to make everyone's life around me easier and to help the players with what they need off the court so they can focus on maximizing their potential.”
If we stopped here, we'd still have a nice local column. The one about the Concord kid who buys sandwiches for NBA Players. Welcomes the players' children to a new-and-improved facility. Things like that.
Elsewhere, Bonner goes to all 82 games, sitting where ever she wants at home games – team box, family lounge, trainer's room to check on an injured player, a ticketed seat with her boyfriend.
She's no hostess, though. She's trying to dispel stereotypes, expand roles for women, move them upstairs, where the decisions are made. She's on the ground floor of a movement to include women in administrative jobs, in the NBA and other leagues.
“I'm aware that I'm part of a minority group,” Bonner said. “I'm proud that I have helped bring female candidates in for interviews and I'm part of the process of bringing women along. I grew up on the women's side, but I was also exposed to the NBA life as well.”
She works with young players, “teaching them healthy habits, financing and family dynamics, time management,” Bonner said.
She scouts college players, in person and on TV, rates their ability, passes on what she's learned to the staff. She's striking a balance between being excited and grounded, mentioning Matt's former coach with the Spurs, Gregg Popovich, known as Pops, one of the best ever.
“Get over yourself,” were Pop's words of wisdom, Bonner said.
She's learning to do that. Keep perspective. She got a truckload of it last year, watching her father fight multiple myeloma and undergo bypass surgery. Dave told me he's feeling better these days.
He and Paula spent their lives watching their three kids shine in basketball. Now, they excel in life.
Team officials were unavailable to comment on Bonner because it's All-Star Weekend, a break in the schedule. She lives in Orlando with her boyfriend. She's enjoying the time off.
“The job is more of a lifestyle,” Bonner said. “When you sign up for this, it's making sure it works, being available to anyone for anything that might happen.”
Including making history.
Certainly no trivial pursuit.

Re "The Triumph of Fiscal Hypocrisy" (column, Feb. 7):
Paul Krugman explains how the Republicans have gained political advantage by blocking fiscal stimulus when it was badly needed during the Great Recession, then supporting profligate stimulus policies well after the economy had recovered.
Add to this fiscal folly the rollback of environmental regulations, even as we are facing a climate crisis of enormous economic consequence.
Yes, the deregulation has likely added some small percentage of short-term G.D.P. growth. But it comes at a potentially staggering cost to future generations, as methane regulations and fuel economy standards are reversed, and critical support for an international climate response is withheld.
What's left of the Republican reputation for competent fiscal stewardship has now gone up in flames.

A Reporter on Race and Andrew Yang

Texto completo: He ran on saving workers from automation, but also leaned into issues of race and representation.
Andrew Yang, the Taiwanese-American businessman whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination exceeded expectations for a political newcomer, dropped out of the race this week after an eighth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Yang pitched himself as an entrepreneurial problem solver on a quest to save America from automation . But as an Asian-American candidate, issues of race and representation became factors in his candidacy, especially as rivals like Julián Castro, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker dropped out and the field winnowed to a handful of white front-runners.
I asked my colleague Matt Stevens , who covered Mr. Yang's campaign, about those dynamics, and he said that Mr. Yang had told him that leading with race and identity was not "necessarily the most helpful way to move any community forward."
I was also interested in what it was like for Matt, as a Korean-American, to report on a candidate who drew support from Asian-Americans but at times leaned into stereotypes on the campaign trail. Here's our conversation:
What did Andrew Yang's entry into the race mean for Asian-Americans? And how they are viewing his exit?
At first, I think, not much. Mr. Yang filed his paperwork to enter the race in the fall of 2017, but he didn't generate any buzz until our colleague Kevin Roose wrote about his campaign months later. And even then, it took an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast in 2019 for people to really start to learn his name.
Because, in the beginning, he was talking so much about the automation of jobs held by the white working class (truckers, for example), and because the audience for podcasts like Mr. Rogan's is mostly white men, white men formed the base of his support.
But as college students and other young voters started taking notice, Asian-Americans began showing up at his events in significant numbers. They were not shy about telling me that they were drawn to him in part because of his race. And in general, I think his supporters -- Asian-American and otherwise -- are sad he dropped out, but confident that this isn't the last they'll hear from him.
Do you think race was a reason he lasted longer than other candidates? Was the #YangGang diverse?
The Yang Gang certainly became diverse, both racially and ideologically. He attracted Trump voters and Bernie Sanders supporters and everyone in between.
Research from AAPI Data has shown that as Mr. Yang's campaign grew, so did financial support from Asian-Americans. And money keeps a campaign viable. But I think he hung on so long, mostly because it was impossible to leave a town hall of his and not feel like he was genuinely normal, very likable and extremely concerned about the future. For many voters sick of politics as usual, that was more than enough.
He took some heat for saying "I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors." What did Mr. Yang tell you about his use of Asian-American stereotypes ?
There was probably no topic I talked more about with Mr. Yang than his handling of his Asian-American identity; and although I am sure some in his campaign found it frustrating, to their credit, Mr. Yang was always made available for an interview on the topic.
I'd boil his response down to a few prongs: He said repeatedly that he was proud of his background and was well aware that he was being seen as a representative of the community. He saw the jokes as a way he could differentiate himself in a crowded field.
There was one thing he told me in an interview for a story about his previous jobs that I think does a nice job of summing up his perspective: "I'm not sure if leading with" race and identity, he said, "is necessarily the most helpful way to move any community forward."
You wrote a deep dive into his career before his campaign that included a lot of perspectives from people who used to work with him, some of them critical. What was the response to that story? In general, did you find that people expected you, as an Asian-American, to be more sympathetic toward him in your coverage?
In some cases, yes, people did seem to have certain expectations of my coverage -- or at least folks said as much on Twitter. Some asserted that my editors had made me write the tough story on Mr. Yang because I was Asian-American -- the idea being, I think, that my byline would somehow inoculate The New York Times from criticism.
And speaking of my byline, I'm a Korean-American adoptee. And I also recall some Twitter users highlighting that fact that my name is Matt Stevens, which I took to mean they thought I could not possibly have borne in mind an Asian-American point of view, given my name.
I did not respond to anyone on Twitter. In my experience, it's usually best not to. But I will say the piece found a wide readership, and I don't think everyone who spent time with the article came to the same conclusions.
Was this assignment a surprise for you?
People sometimes ask if I was put on the Andrew Yang beat because I am Asian-American. The answer is no. And I think the story of how I came to cover him offers another lesson about why it is so important to have a diversity of voices and perspectives in the newsroom.
In short, I was assigned in the spring of 2019 to go listen to the Democratic candidates speak at a conference down the street from our office. It was the first time I saw Mr. Yang give his stump speech, and he used his now well-worn tagline: "The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math."
The joke did not land. And as an Asian-American, I found it a little unusual coming from a presidential candidate. So, in one of my better moments, I suggested that we write a story on the ways Mr. Yang was leaning into his Asian-American identity on the trail. I developed a few sources on the campaign, Mr. Yang persisted in the race, and then, when the ways he was talking about being Asian-American became news again, I was well positioned to tackle race-related stories with what I think and hope was complexity and nuance.
I came to believe that this was a necessary contribution.

The Push to Get Asian-Americans to Complete the Census
"Asian-Americans have been relegated as the subminority -- that we're not black, we're not Hispanic. For a large part, we're an afterthought."
-- Gene Wu, a Democratic state representative from Houston who is Chinese-American
Our national race correspondent, John Eligon, wrote this week about how Asian-Americans reported that they were less likely to fill out their census forms than any other demographic group. They are also the least familiar with the census, on average, and the most worried that their information will be used against them, according to a Census Bureau report.
Activists told John that Asian-Americans remained largely misunderstood and that they were determined to use this year's census to showcase the group's multiplicity, secure better resources and funding, and harness untapped political power.

Texto completo: A monster movie is available for streaming. And a documentary about the famous dwarf planet is on Discovery.
What's Streaming
SUPER 8 (2011) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg, "Super 8" has all the makings of a classic monster movie. It takes place in 1979, in a small Ohio town largely populated by steel workers and their children, including Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), the story's protagonist. Joe -- who lives with his father, the local sheriff (Kyle Chandler) -- is filming a zombie movie with his 11-year-old friends when they witness a train crash, and they investigate. "You know that, in the homestretch, big battles will be fought, lessons will be learned, the elusive monster will be revealed and other loose ends will be tied up," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He adds, "You may wish it did not all happen in such a perfunctory, predictable way."
DRIVING MISS DAISY (1989) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy star in this film adaptation of Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Miss Daisy (Tandy), an affluent Jewish woman in Atlanta, has been deemed no longer fit to operate a vehicle by her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd), who instead hires her a driver. He chooses Hoke Calhoun (Freeman) for the job. The 60-year-old widower has an incredible tolerance for Miss Daisy's stubbornness and the film chronicles a friendship that lasts 25 years. "Miss Daisy and Hoke are as much outsiders for their age and sensibility as for anything else," Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times, adding, "Theirs is the friendship of equals."
What's on TV
#TEAMPLUTO 11:01 p.m. on Discovery. On Feb. 18, 1930, Pluto was discovered at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. But in 2006, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. In this Discovery Channel special on Pluto's 90th anniversary, scientists return to the Lowell Observatory to discuss the reasoning behind the change and the possibility of its gaining status as a planet once again.
AMAZON EMPIRE: THE RISE AND REIGN OF JEFF BEZOS 9 p.m. on PBS. This two-hour special explores Jeff Bezos's multi-billion-dollar company. In Amazon's 26-year life span, the company and its founder have faced scrutiny over their wide reach and influence. "Amazon Empire" interviews critics who claim the company is nearing a monopoly status, as well as former executives, government officials and Amazon employees.
HOT ONES: THE GAME SHOW 10 p.m. on TruTV. This new half-hour game show combines trivia and hot wings for the chance to win $ 25,000. In each episode, two teams compete in three rounds of trivia accompanied by chicken wings with increasingly spicy sauces. If the contestants can maintain their cool enough to advance through the rounds, they may earn a soothing milkshake and a cash prize. Sean Evans, an executive producer, also hosts.

At 98, a Judicial Lion Lays Down His Gavel To Pursue New Interests

Texto completo: After 53 years as a federal judge in Brooklyn, Jack B. Weinstein is retiring. He still has a stubborn belief in the American future.
For more than half a century, Judge Jack B. Weinstein was the quintessential activist jurist, using his longtime perch on the federal bench in Brooklyn to champion causes like gun control and school desegregation. In his career -- one of the longest in American legal history -- he carved out a niche as both a liberal hero and, not surprisingly, a bane for conservatives.
Last week, at age 98, Judge Weinstein announced his retirement, saying he no longer had the stamina to perform his daily duties. In an interview with The New York Times, he looked back over a tenure so packed with accolades that his résumé now runs to more than 70 pages. He said his unremitting hope and faith in the judicial system remained intact even in the current polarized political climate.
"I'm convinced our country is bound to equalize, democratize and to save with love, not hate," he said.
Born in Kansas in 1921, Judge Weinstein earned his law degree in 1948 from Columbia University after playing bit parts on Broadway and serving as a submarine officer in the Pacific theater during World War II.
In his early years as a lawyer, he helped write legal briefs in the landmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education. After he was named to the bench in 1967 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, he presided over groundbreaking mass tort cases involving the use of asbestos and the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange.
At the height of his career, Judge Weinstein, who is known for his impressive eyebrows and his iconoclastic temperament, handled several high-profile Mafia cases, including the prosecution of Vincent Gigante, known as the Chin, the former boss of the Genovese crime family. A stickler for propriety, Judge Weinstein once ordered the mob don, famous for dressing in his bathrobe, to shower and spruce up when he came to court.
In the past decade, Judge Weinstein turned his attention even further toward legal changes, publicly calling for more female lawyers to have speaking roles in court and decrying the "lack of sentencing alternatives" for violent young criminals who, he said, are often written off as "society's unredeemables." He has also tackled the endemic problem of police officers lying on the witness stand.
Why retire now?
I've decided I've exhausted my extra store of energy, and I really can't undertake any cases with the promise that I'll have enough energy, physical energy, to hear them appropriately. The last thing I would want to do was take new cases and not be able to give them adequate attention.
How would you like to see your legacy described?
I would like to be remembered for trying to work with individuals to help them avoid the life-killing environment of prisons and to save them for a life with relatives and friends, with a job, and with the opportunity to lead a lawful life. Partly by reducing sentences to the extent possible, partly by reducing supervised release and partly by getting them out into the real world. It's on a one-to-one basis that I see myself operating -- the judge to the individual defendant.
What about recent reforms to the criminal justice system?
Individual judges can accomplish more with the aid of our pretrial and post-trial supervision, a shortening of the period needed to integrate people back into society. In my case, I can do it just by shortening sentences. That's the quickest way to shorten the amount of excessive time we use for incarceration.
Sentencing reform has been a focus of yours for a long time, no?
From the outset. I was born in a period just after World War I in an area right outside one of the Wichita Indian settlements. And I saw a lot of terrible things during the Depression. People sleeping in parks and on the streets. And when I came back from the war, during that postwar period, we did a great deal to equalize opportunities for women, African-Americans, Jews and a lot of discriminated-against people. And our equalization rate went way up. Now it's starting to crash. But I'm convinced our country is bound to equalize, democratize and to save with love, not hate.
Why are you so convinced about that trajectory?
We've come so far toward equalization. The country has changed so enormously for the better. Now, yes, it is going downhill. But I'm convinced that we will come together. It's essentially a good country made up of people who will fight for what's right.
Are you concerned that the federal judiciary may be changing?
At the appellate level, yes, it's a problem. And the Supreme Court, it's become very conservative. But our district court structure remains very good. The judges are good and they will protect and improve democracy and equality.
You have always run a transparent courtroom. What are your feelings about the role of the media in the legal process?
The media is essential because if people don't know what's going on, they can't make sensible decisions. They can't understand what their own role is. If they're getting lies or improper information, how can they can handle their responsibilities as American voting citizens? It simply won't work.
So what will you do now?
I would like to take a master's degree in history. I'm particularly interested in Jim Crowism -- how African-Americans earned equality and then had it taken from them. I have a son who is a physician who just retired and he and I are going to be studying that together. How did this great victory that was won in the Civil War get snatched away by a combination of southern slave owners and northerners who bought cheap cotton? The artifacts of which are still present to a large degree in places like New York where, even after Brown v. Board of Education, there remains essentially a segregated school system.

Texto completo: The American Pharmacists Association says we need to look at how pharmacies are reimbursed and who profits. Also: The folly of environmental deregulation; the poor and the cashless society.
To the Editor:
The mistakes described in "Overloaded Pharmacists Warn They're Making Fatal Mistakes" (front page, Feb. 1) keep me up at night. Even one medication error is too many.
Unfortunately, the current system sets pharmacists up to fail. The weight of the potentially dire consequences of filling the wrong prescription or missing dangerous drug interactions is crushing pharmacists, personally and professionally.
The solution comes from taking a hard look at how pharmacies are reimbursed and who profits from inadequate patient care.
Pharmacy benefit managers make piles of money with no proof they serve patients. They say they keep prices and premiums down but fight efforts to demystify how they achieve this. If it's not greedy, let's see how it works. If it really helps patients, tell us how. But they won't. It's indefensible.
Patient safety must always remain a priority. We need change now.

Climate, the Economy and Deregulation
To the Editor:
Re "The Triumph of Fiscal Hypocrisy" (column, Feb. 7):
Paul Krugman explains how the Republicans have gained political advantage by blocking fiscal stimulus when it was badly needed during the Great Recession, then supporting profligate stimulus policies well after the economy had recovered.
Add to this fiscal folly the rollback of environmental regulations, even as we are facing a climate crisis of enormous economic consequence.
Yes, the deregulation has likely added some small percentage of short-term G.D.P. growth. But it comes at a potentially staggering cost to future generations, as methane regulations and fuel economy standards are reversed, and critical support for an international climate response is withheld.
What's left of the Republican reputation for competent fiscal stewardship has now gone up in flames.

Helping the Poor Go Cashless
To the Editor:
Re "Cashless Businesses? City Council Says No" (news article, Jan. 24):
It is disheartening to see the New York City Council follow the lead of Philadelphia and San Francisco in banning cashless retail establishments.
This measure only attacks a symptom of discrimination, not the root cause. Far too many people lack access to the banking system, which studies show is essential to improving their income-earning ability over time. So why not give banks more incentives to serve low-income people?
For example, Congress could change the Community Reinvestment Act to incentivize banks to issue debit cards, without overdraft provisions. Instead of fighting against the digital economy, government leaders should be doing more to ensure that their residents can participate in it.

Jellyfish mucus found to be the stinging agent

Texto completo: Tropical snorkelers, be advised.
Unlucky divers and swimmers have experienced “stinging water," a mysterious occurrence when people are stung when they get near, but don't touch, Cassiopeia, a type of jellyfish that spends its time hanging out upside-down.
What causes this frustrating phenomenon? Scientists say it's a malicious mucus emitted by the jellyfish.
After years of research, scientists published a study Thursday in Communications Biology , a journal from Nature Research, that revealed that toxic cells from Cassiopeia are shot into the surrounding water.
“The answer was right under our noses," Cheryl Ames, a marine biologist and lead author of the study, said in an e-mail.
Sparked by their own encounters with stinging water, a team led by scientists from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History set out to find the culprit. Examining samples of the jellyfish mucus under a microscope, researchers saw small balls spinning in the slime.
“We thought it might be caused by bits of jellyfish tentacles, a larval stage of jellyfish, or sea anemones, or some other unexplained phenomenon," Ames said.
The bumpy little balls, called cassiosomes, turned out to be hollow spheres of cells that were likely filled with the same substance that gives jellyfish their structure, the Smithsonian said in a statement. Discovered for the first time, the cassiosomes were found to be fringed with thousands of stinging cells called nematocysts. Usually found in tentacles, nematocysts are filled with toxins.
When they provoked the jellyfish, researchers observed the self-propelled cassiosomes slowly breaking away and leaving the jellyfish's arms and mingling with the animal's mucus. The mucus then disperses in the surrounding waters, waiting for victims.
Angel Yanagihara, an associate researcher at the University of Hawaii who studies jellyfish venom and was not involved with the study, told the New York Times that the study is “paradigm-shifting," changing the way scientists will think about jellyfish feeding and stinging going forward.
Snorkelers need not be afraid, however, researchers said. No serious injuries or deaths have been caused by “stinging water." To prevent such attacks, Ames encourages people to wear protective clothing in areas where there may be Cassiopeia.
US Navy scientists have been curious about the phenomenon for years because of its effect on their divers, Gary Vora, a coauthor of the study and a deputy laboratory head at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., told the Times.
When Navy divers return from the waters, sometimes they're “lit up like a Christmas tree," he told the Times. “You have evidence of a sting, but you never saw what stung you."
Because of the findings, scientists have a better understanding of Cassiopeia's feeding habits. It “uses the edge of its umbrella to push water over its frilly feeding structures," sucking in a net of mucus filled with prey, such as tiny shrimp and plankton, Ames said.
“We now know that the prey are captured after being stunned and killed on contact with the motile cassiosomes in the mucus," Ames said.

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS — Who is ready to pick the next Democratic presidential nominee?
Not Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader and Democratic kingmaker here, who is holding off on endorsing a candidate before this Saturday's important Nevada caucuses. Not the Culinary Union, a powerful labor force in this state, which last week endorsed its “goals" instead of singling out a chosen candidate.
And not Nick Russo, a 62-year-old chauffeur from Las Vegas, who was undecided even as he stood in a winding line for early voting under a resplendent blue sky here on Monday morning.
“You've got the ultimate evil in there now," Russo said as the line inched forward, using every last second to puzzle over the question of who could beat President Trump. “I have to use my better judgment as to who's going to get in there on the other side."
After more than a year of presidential campaigning and voting in Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats in Nevada and around the nation are confronting a moment of excruciating, frustrating, and perhaps unexpected ambiguity: It is just plain hard to figure out who to put up against Trump.
Iowa offered up a muddled result — one that is still, more than two weeks later, being tallied — and New Hampshire offered the nation a first-place finisher, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, separated from the second-place finisher, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, by 1.3 percentage points.
Now, as eyes turn to Nevada, which is the first early-voting state with a diverse population, many voters interviewed in Las Vegas and Reno were still struggling to decide or were second-guessing themselves. Some of the influential figures they could look to — including Reid or the popular first-term governor Mike Sisolak — are publicly sitting out the race instead of clarifying it with their influence and, more crucially, their organizational muscle.
“They're putting it off," said Karen Mulawski, a retiree who attended an Elizabeth Warren event in Las Vegas. Mulawski said the paucity of leading endorsements was prompting her to put off her own decision.
“A lot of people are saying they'll vote for anybody that's against Trump, anybody," said Mulawski. “But if they say that, then how do we pick?"
The indecision here, among rank-and-file voters and influential political figures, is both a cause and an effect of a deeply unsettled presidential race in which candidate's “electability" looms larger for voters than a candidate's policies or ideology, and it's a possible sign of a drawn-out nomination battle to come.
“Democrats are desperately searching for the candidate who has the best chance to beat Donald Trump . . . and it isn't clear," said Larry Sabato, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia. “I think people are hanging back, especially the moderates, hoping there is some coalition that emerges."
Endorsements do not always influence rank-and-file voters, but they can help a candidate secure momentum and are often a sign of a party's willingness to coalesce around a leading candidate.
Any unwillingness to choose is certainly not limited to Nevada. Former president Barack Obama and much of his inner circle has stayed far away from making any endorsements. Some newspapers, including the Las Vegas Sun and The New York Times, have decided to endorse two candidates, while others have held off on deciding at all.
Some voters in Nevada have found themselves as confused as ever. Melanie Scott, 69, a retiree who saw Warren speak in Reno on Sunday, listed four top choices in an interview: Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg, and (Amy) Klobuchar. “And," she added, “I really like Joe Biden."
She admitted she was thinking more about other voters than she was about herself. “I don't know who those mystery voters are who voted for Trump," Scott said. “I don't know what would appeal to them."
Here in Nevada, no endorsement — or lack thereof — is seen as more consequential than that of the Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 hotel workers, bartenders, and cooks, more than half of whom are Latino, and runs a robust voter turnout operation.
Last week, the union warned in a flier to its members that Sanders's Medicare for All plan would end culinary workers' hard-fought health care benefits, but when it came time to announce their endorsement on Thursday, they said they weren't throwing their weight behind any single candidate.
“We want the members, they decide," said Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the union's secretary treasurer, in an interview on Saturday.
The union's nondecision has been widely seen as a blow to Biden, who appears to be well-liked by rank-and-file union members and whose flailing candidacy needs every boost it can get.
“If the union decided to bring all of its muscle to bear, it's very good at its messaging and turning out its members," said Jon Ralston, the editor of the Nevada Independent. “If they had decided to harness their horsepower behind Joe Biden with enough time, it would have made a difference."
The union did name-check Biden when it announced its lack of an endorsement, saying he had “been our friend," and some union members who lined up outside of the local for early voting Monday said they planned to support him.
“What we are looking for is people who protect our health plan," said Gerardo Saldivar, 64, a bus person at the Top of the World restaurant, who planned to choose Biden as his first choice, Buttigieg as his second, and the billionaire Tom Steyer as his third. “No Bernie Sanders," he said.
Many voters in Iowa and New Hampshire also had difficulty deciding and a recent Nevada poll by the Las Vegas Review Journal and AARP said 8 percent of respondents were undecided. Some 26,000 Nevadans had cast their ballots in early voting as of Monday morning.
One thing making it harder for voters and party elites to settle on a candidate is that the ongoing primaries seem to be expanding the number of viable contenders instead of reducing it.
Klobuchar finished third in New Hampshire, triggering an infusion of cash and momentum. Steyer could have his strongest finish yet in South Carolina, where he has spent heavily. Biden collapsed in the first two states, but he may do better as the contest moves forward through the primary calendar.
“He's going to do well in Nevada, he's going to do extremely well in South Carolina," said Harry Reid when he voted on Saturday. “People should not be counting Joe Biden out of the race yet."
Reid told reporters he voted “uncommitted" for his first, second, and third choices, and had warm words for several other candidates running, including Klobuchar and even Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor.
The apparently expanding field of viable candidates left such voters as Bonnie Barnett, a health care consultant, second-guessing themselves. Barnett was planning to vote for Buttigieg as she stood in line at the early-voting site at the Culinary Union on Monday.
“I'm a little conflicted because of Bloomberg's coming on the scene," Barnett said. And though she was sticking with Buttigieg, she said, she wondered if Bloomberg, who is not on the Nevada ballot, would ultimately be a stronger candidate. “I just don't know that Buttigieg can beat Trump."
Russo, the chauffeur, spoke with some regret as he acknowledged that his final decision — still unmade as he stood in line — would be more about electability than politics or policy.
And how was he going to make it?
“You're going to leave me alone," he told a reporter, “and I'm going to be with my own thoughts."

Va. lawmakers defeat military-style weapons ban

Texto completo: A bill that would have banned military-style rifles in Virginia was defeated in the state Senate on Monday, a sign of the limited power of the state's new Democratic majority in enacting the most restrictive elements of its gun-control agenda and a blow to Governor Ralph Northam's efforts to restrict gun possession.
The prohibition on military-style rifles was the most contentious of a series of gun-control bills making their way through the state Legislature this year and the centerpiece of Democrats' attempts to restrict firearms after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in Virginia Beach last May.
The state is at the heart of a long-simmering debate related to the nation's uneasy accommodation regarding gun laws, with Democrats in the state's urban areas and suburbs supporting gun-control measures, while many rural residents have mounted large gun-rights protests in response.
The assault-weapons bill rejected Monday would have prohibited the sale, purchase, manufacture, and most transfers of military-style weapons, and large-capacity magazines holding more than 12 rounds. It would have also banned trigger activators, including bump stocks, designed to make weapons simulate automatic machine-gun fire.
Four Democrats on the 15-member Senate Judiciary Committee joined six Republicans in voting to send the proposal to a state commission for further study. The measure is likely to be debated again next year, lawmakers said.
The Democrats represent both suburban and urban areas, and each of the lawmakers had supported other gun-control measures this session.
But one of the Democrats, R. Creigh Deeds, said there was discomfort in enacting an outright ban because lawmakers had failed to arrive at a consensus definition of what constitutes an assault weapon despite weeks of negotiations. Deeds said there remained “a lot of questions" about the definition.
The initial version of the measure would have prohibited all assault-style weapons in the state, which would have required owners to turn them in. But that version was recently overhauled to allow owners to keep their weapons.
On Monday, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group that organized a massive gun-rights rally at the Virginia State Capitol last month, praised the vote on Twitter.
“VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Van Cleave tweeted.

Miller nuptials illustrate difficulty of dating in D.C.
Stephen Miller and Katie Waldman, who met while he was developing the administration's restrictive immigration policies and she was working as a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, were married at President Trump's hotel Sunday evening.
The wedding details, dished out in increments by the bride to reporters over the past few months, illustrate what it meant for one notorious Trump aide to get married in a heavily Democratic town where the mere sight of him is known to create angry confrontations.
They hired security. Wedding invitations contained a card detailing the couple's privacy requests. The registry was created under a fake name. Invited friends who might bring unruly partisans as their guests to the wedding were screened.
In the end, the nuptials were stocked with Trump administration officials, including Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and the people who love the couple. (The people who don't love them created a hashtag that mocked the event for being held at the president's hotel.) The couple celebrated with monogrammed ice cubes, mutual statements of love, and a playlist selected by the groom.
“Spectacular and very special wedding tonight with new bride and groom Stephen and Katie Miller!" Reince Priebus, a former White House chief of staff, wrote on Twitter. “So much fun and still going with @RealDonaldTrump having fun and the band is going strong!"
But the scene reflected what has been an uncomfortable truth for young aides since the beginning of the administration: Washington's highly politicized culture — a reality that the president and zealous officials like Miller have directly contributed to — can be brutal on dating life. This mirrors a larger trend taking place throughout the rest of America, according to specialists: Singles, particularly members of the under-40 crowd, do not want to match with people outside their political tribe.
For aides in this White House, one solution seems to be to meet and marry each other, or at least endeavor to find love inside the political bunker of the Trump administration.

Trump campaign tweets old Daytona 500 photo
President Trump's campaign manager on Sunday tweeted, and later deleted, a photo of Air Force One ascending above a crowd of NASCAR fans in Florida. The president, he wrote, "won the #Daytona500 before the race even started."
The image, it turned out, was 16 years old.
Brad Parscale deleted the tweet about three hours later and posted another tweet with an updated photo.
The president and Melania Trump attended the annual race in Daytona Beach on Sunday. The president served as the event's grand marshal in what was widely seen as an opportunity to court his supporters in the swing state ahead of the November election.
"Rubber will burn, fans will scream, and the Great American Race will begin," the president said, before taking a lap on the track in his limousine, called "the Beast." He commanded drivers to start their engines, but the race was ultimately postponed to Monday because of rain.
The stands were filled with revelers, some wearing Trump 2020 T-shirts and hats. His visit marked the second appearance at the race by a sitting president. The last was in 2004, when President George W. Bush helped kick off the event.
Photographer Jonathan Ferrey was there that year and took the photo of Air Force One that Parscale originally tweeted.
"I have a lot of talented colleagues photographing the Daytona 500 this year," Ferrey told CNN. "I am unfortunately not there today, but apparently I won the Daytona 500 photography before the race even started."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser John Bolton expressed his frustrations Monday about the "censorship" from the White House regarding his new book.
Speaking at Duke University during his first public appearance since the conclusion of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, Bolton said, "I hope my book is not suppressed," referring to the current battle between him and the White House over a pre-publication national security review of the material in the book.

Media reports from the event said Bolton called the leaks of his book about Ukraine "the sprinkles on an ice cream sundae" and said the book "is an effort to write history. We'll see what comes out of the censorship. "
When asked about Trump saying the now-infamous call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was "perfect. " Bolton responded, "You’ll love chapter 14. "
Calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate Impeachment trial were heightened after a New York Times report about Bolton's manuscript claimed that Trump explicitly told Bolton he did not want to release the withheld aid until Ukraine helped with investigations related to the 2016 election and Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, who had business dealings in the country.
Despite the uproar, the Senate voted against motions to call additional witnesses.
Bombshell book: What we know about John Bolton's allegations about Trump and Ukraine
Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened," is supposed to be published on March 17. He said Tuesday, "I didn’t think I was obligated to go through prepublication review. When my first book came out I didn’t. But we’re in the process now," adding, "and for now, I’m going to let it go. "
Bolton's team submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council over a month ago for a standard review to see whether the book contains information that should not be made public.
The Trump administration has raised concerns that the book includes classified information.
Rep. Adam Schiff, who served as the lead House impeachment manager in the trial of President Donald Trump, said the former national security adviser declined to sign an affidavit about what he knew after the Senate voted against calling more witnesses.

"For whatever reason, he apparently was willing to testify before the Senate, but apart from that, seems intent on saving it for his book," said Schiff, D-Calif.
Bolton also hit the administration on a few foreign policy issues during the event, saying it was "perfectly evident" that Trump's North Korea policy "was going to fail" and that he doesn't "think we are applying maximum pressure" to Iran.
Bolton is scheduled to appear Wednesday alongside President Barack Obama's former national security adviser Susan Rice at an event at Vanderbilt University.

There is no one to stop Trump now

Texto completo: When the subject of Attorney General William P. Barr comes up these days, it's hard not to think of John S. McCain. Not the late senator, mind you, but the USS John S. McCain, the naval destroyer named for his father and grandfather.
It was an incident involving this ship that, as much as anything else, captures how the Trump administration " and its attorney general " operates. It explains Barr's intervention into the criminal sentencing of Trump's longtime friend and adviser, felon Roger Stone, and much, much more.
The McCain was docked at the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan in May 2019, when the 7th Fleet issued a directive that had originated from conversations with the White House Military Office. The president was coming to Yokosuka on Memorial Day, and so, accordingly: 'USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.' So sailors were ordered to hang a tarp over the vessel's name, and they removed any coverings that bore the words 'John S. McCain.'
President Trump didn't need to say a word. It just happened. He didn't even know, he later said. But he was hardly displeased. 'I was not a big fan of John McCain in any shape or form,' Trump said. 'Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, okay? And they were well-meaning.'
Anticipating Trump's narcissistic whims and desires in just this fashion remains the key to survival in his administration, and outside the White House proper, no one does it better than Barr. It's thus entirely believable, as both Barr and Trump have said, that Trump never gave Barr any instruction about Stone's case.
But no one could doubt, least of all Barr, what Trump's reaction would be to line prosecutors' recommendation of a seven-to-nine-year sentence for Stone. When Stone was convicted in November on seven counts of witness tampering and lying to Congress, the president of the United States tweeted, 'Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr - Nellie, Steele - all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn't they lie?'
So when it came to Stone's sentence, Barr likely knew what to do, without ever being told. And he has known what to do, whenever feasible, to keep Trump happy all along. Even before he became attorney general, Barr was singing a tune that must have been music to Trump's ears: He sent an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department arguing (wrongly) that Trump was legally incapable of obstructing the Mueller investigation.
Later, when he received Mueller's final report, Barr misled the public about it, facilitating Trump's endlessly repeated " but false " mantra that the report exonerated the president. Since then, Barr has personally supervised a mysterious re-investigation of the Russia investigation, seemingly trying to substantiate his boss's conspiracy theories about the original investigation's origins. And now we have his intervention in favor of Stone, which duly earned Barr the president's praise, and his reported review of politically sensitive (meaning, sensitive to Trump) criminal cases, such as the one against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The most important thing Barr did for Trump, though, involved the arms-for-dirt-on-Biden Ukraine scandal " which should have prompted a full-blown criminal investigation with a special counsel. Any U.S. attorney's office would fall over itself to investigate, for example, a state governor who, while running for reelection against a former mayor, so much as hinted to the mayor's successor that, say, highway funds would be restricted unless the current mayor were to announce an inquiry into her predecessor's alleged corruption.
But instead of investigating the Ukraine shakedown, Barr's Justice Department immediately gave the president a clean bill of health. Saving Trump from that criminal investigation was more than what Roy Cohn ever did for any of his clients.
So when Barr announced last week that 'I think it's time to stop tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,' and that the president's statements 'make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity' " he wasn't actually standing up for the Justice Department's integrity, or its independence, or for the rule of law.
To the contrary, as his (and my) friend Fox News host Laura Ingraham put it, 'Barr was basically telling Trump, don't worry, I got this.' In other words, don't blow this by calling attention to all that I do for you. Don't say the quiet part out loud.
But the president will never listen, and what Barr does for him will never be enough. Now having been acquitted by the Senate, Trump thinks he's bulletproof, legally and otherwise. He now brags, as he tweeted on Saturday, that he is ' 'the King' ' who was targeted but not taken down. And, drawing on an article in the New York Times that suggested he is stained but unshackled, Trump boasted that he has indeed survived ' 'triumphant' ' and ' 'emboldened' ' and ' 'focused' ' more than ever on prosecuting ' 'his case of grievance, persecution, and resentment.' '
So Trump wants to say the quiet part out loud; he wants to say he's got this. And there's no one to stop him now.
George T. Conway III is a lawyer and is also an adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump super PAC.

Texto completo: Former White House national security adviser John Bolton on Monday questioned whether it was 'fair' that President Trump has called him a liar on the subject of Ukraine, but 'I can't talk about it.'
In his first public remarks since Trump was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate, Bolton said his own views of national security policies, and descriptions of interactions with Trump on Ukraine and other issues, risk being 'suppressed' and censored by the administration.
His ability to speak was restrained, he said, because of the White House 'prepublication review' of his forthcoming book 'and threats of possible legal action.'
In a 90-minute question-and-answer session before students, faculty and members of the public at Duke University, Bolton voiced familiar hard-line views on North Korea, Iran and other issues. He said he viewed Ukraine and the impeachment 'as sprinkles on the ice cream sundae' compared with other subjects he deals with in the book.
Asked whether he agreed with the president's assessment that Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was 'perfect,' Bolton said 'You'll love Chapter-14.'
Bolton left the administration in September, after 17 months as Trump's third national security adviser, following policy rifts with the president. Trump announced via Twitter that he had fired Bolton, although Bolton, also via Twitter, said he had resigned. Bolton's book about his time at the White House, titled 'The Room Where It Happened,' is scheduled to be published on March 17.
Portions of the book were leaked to the New York Times, including Bolton's firsthand account of what he said were discussions with Trump about the president's withholding of aid to Ukraine unless its government investigated his Democratic political rivals. Those allegations became the basis of Trump's impeachment in December.
After the impeachment, Bolton offered to testify at the subsequent Senate trial, if subpoenaed, but the Republican majority voted not to call witnesses. This month, the Senate acquitted the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction. In recent weeks, the White House " to which Bolton submitted his book for national security vetting " has told him it has 'serious concerns' about what it says is classified information in the book.
Bolton's lawyer has disputed that assessment and asked for the White House to expedite completion of its review. It remains unclear whether publication will go ahead without White House approval.
'I hope it's not suppressed,' Bolton said. 'This is an effort to write history, and I did it the best I can. We'll have to see what comes out of the censorship.'
'I say things in the manuscript about what he said to me,' he said. 'I hope they become public someday. He tweets, but I can't talk about it. How fair is that?'
Bolton hinted that the book contains revelations on a number of subjects, but he declined to answer a number of specific questions. Asked for his account of Trump's controversial meeting with Russian President Vladi mir Putin in the summer of 2018, he said, 'I could read a chapter from my book and give you an answer.'
'In my view, to pursue the right policies for America, I was willing to put up with a lot,' he said.
Bolton has denied leaking any of the manuscript and suggested that the revelations came from within the administration. 'Probably with leaks coming out of the administration, in due course you'll know everything that's in the book.'
He voiced his well-known views about North Korea, saying that the administration's effort to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program was 'going to fail.'
Despite Trump's claims that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he would do so, Bolton said there was 'not a single piece of evidence that the government of North Korea intends to give up nuclear weapons.'
'This idea that they can be coaxed into giving up … their nuclear program was flawed from the start,' he said.
Pyongyang, he said, was 'jiving the Americans' and is getting closer every day to the capability of dropping a nuclear weapon on American cities.
On Venezuela, Bolton said the administration's 'theatrics' were 'not equivalent to support' for the removal of the government of President Nicolás Maduro.
Bolton said China, which he described as 'the number one national security issue for the rest of the century,' may have known about the coronavirus epidemic 'weeks and weeks before it was announced.'
About 1,000 people attended the free event. Outside, a protest drew about two dozen students and faculty members who objected to Bolton's hard-line views.
After Bolton's appearance was announced earlier this month, all available tickets were distributed within minutes.
Duke University has its own connection to prior impeachments. Richard M. Nixon, Class of 1937, and former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, Class of 1973, earned their law degrees there.
Bolton is also scheduled to speak Wednesday, alongside former Obama administration national security adviser Susan E. Rice, at Vanderbilt University.

Texto completo: Stanley Cohen, a biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his research on the growth of cells and helped build a foundation for other scientists studying cancer, dementia and other disorders, died Feb. 5 at a retirement community in Nashville. He was-97.
The death was announced in a statement from Vanderbilt University, where he was a longtime professor of biochemistry. The cause was not disclosed.
Dr. Cohen made his early scientific breakthroughs in the 1950s, when he was at Washington University in St. Louis. His colleague at the time, Rita Levi-Montalcini, had made a seminal discovery of a protein known as nerve growth factor, which stimulated the growth of nerve cells in laboratory mice.
The two scientists identified the chemical properties and molecular structure of nerve growth factor, or NGF, which marked the first time a biochemical agent that controlled cellular growth had been isolated.
'I did the chemistry, she did the biology,' Dr. Cohen told The Washington Post in 1986. 'It was a completely collaborative effort.'
After moving to Nashville in 1959 to teach at Vanderbilt, Dr. Cohen continued his research in a small laboratory, assisted only by a technician and one postdoctoral student. He often walked the halls, puffing on a corncob pipe as he devised basic experiments that would have far-reaching and even profound effects.
In perhaps his most significant experiments, he injected proteins from the salivary glands of adult mice into newborn mice. He found that those mice opened their eyes and developed teeth several days sooner than usual.
Dr. Cohen determined that this early development was spurred by a substance similar to NGF, which he called epidermal growth factor, or EGF. In other experiments, he learned that EGF appeared to stimulate growth in other organs throughout the body and also promoted the healing of damaged skin and other cells.
'It was very simple thinking,' he told the New York Times in 1986. 'We were speeding up a natural process, and since nature has spent so many millions of years perfecting her processes, it must be of interest to know how we change the normal program.'
Another of Dr. Cohen's major discoveries was the protein on the cell membrane to which the EGF binds. He called the protein the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGF receptor.
When the EGF and the receptor proteins interact, or bind, the result is 'a signaling cascade from the receptor to the cell nucleus,' Robert J. Coffey, a cancer researcher and onetime colleague of Dr. Cohen's at Vanderbilt, said in an interview. 'It was a foundational discovery. He's left a very rich legacy in our understanding of precise signaling pathways, and we continue to learn new lessons from his work.'
Mutations in the EGF receptors have been linked with certain forms of lung cancer and brain cancer. Using the building blocks Dr. Cohen put in place, researchers have discovered that EGF receptors can be targeted with specific drugs to inhibit their unchecked growth, holding a possible key to treating cancer and other diseases.
The importance of Dr. Cohen's and Levi-Montalcini's research was not fully understood at first. Over time, however, it has become a paradigm for scientists studying cellular development and seeking possible treatments for cancer, dementia, burns and other maladies.
'The idea is it gives an inkling as to what controls cell growth,' Dr. Cohen said in 1986. 'A cancer cell is a normal cell that's gone wild. If we don't even know what goes on in a normal cell, how do we know what makes that one go wild?'
Dr. Cohen and Levi-Montalcini, who died in 2012, shared the 1986 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.
'On our own we were good and competent,' Dr. Cohen said of their experimental work. 'Together we were marvelous.'
Stanley Cohen was born Nov.-17, 1922, in Brooklyn. His father was a tailor, his mother a homemaker.
Dr. Cohen, who had polio as a child, walked with a limp throughout his life. He graduated in 1943 from Brooklyn College, which he said he could afford only because the college had free tuition at the time.
He received a master's degree in zoology from Ohio's Oberlin College in 1945 and a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Michigan in 1948. He taught at the University Colorado before joining the faculty of Washington University in 1952.
He and Levi-Montalcini, who was denied opportunities to teach and practice medicine in her native Italy because of her Jewish heritage, formed an innovative scientific partnership.
'When we started, we were following a little trail of interesting observations,' Dr. Cohen told the Los Angeles Times in 1986. 'We had no expectation it would open up a whole field of research.'
He was named to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980 and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1986. When Dr. Cohen received the Nobel Prize, Coffey said, nothing changed about his manner, his spartan laboratory or his casual wardrobe.
His marriage to Olivia Larson ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife since 1981, Jan Jordan of Nashville; two children and a stepson from his first marriage; and two granddaughters.
After retiring from Vanderbilt in 2000, Dr. Cohen lived for several years in Arizona, where he was part of program in which scientists mentored elementary and high school students.
'Many new things are found by accident,' he told a student group in 2007. 'If you're prepared to see the accident, you can find it.'

Texto completo: Disgraced Hollywood filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, vilified for two ugly years in the court of public opinion, seeks absolution this week from a Manhattan jury.
But even a verdict of "not guilty" appears unlikely to change the way most people view the Oscar-winning producer after upward of 90 women emerged with allegations of his sexual misconduct.
"Even if Weinstein is acquitted, he has already been tried and convicted in the press before the prosecution began," said Rebecca Roiphe, New York Law School professor and former Manhattan prosecutor. "No matter the outcome, there is no vindication for Weinstein."
The panel of seven men and five women is poised to deliberate his fate beginning Tuesday. Weinstein, 67, faces five felony counts: first-degree rape, third-degree rape, criminal sexual act in the first degree and two counts of predatory sexual assault.
The man behind movie classics "Pulp Fiction" and "Shakespeare in Love" could spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted of the last two counts. The jury, before considering those charges, must first find him guilty of raping and sexually assaulting two women at the heart of the case: Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley.
Since jury selection began on Jan. 6, the once-powerful producer has hobbled into Judge James Burke's 15th-floor courtroom in Manhattan Supreme Court while using a walker. Prosecutors denounced the device as "prop" to win some sympathy for the defendant.
Aside from one male juror admonished for falling asleep, the panel appeared laser-focused while dutifully taking notes throughout the four-week trial. None even blinked when shown naked photos of the defendant earlier this month.
Weinstein rejected the chance to testify in his own defense following a 30-minute conference with his attorneys, limiting his remarks throughout the trial to one-liners for reporters as he exited the courthouse each afternoon.
The six women to testify against Weinstein in a sex crimes trial seen by some as a referendum on the #MeToo movement comprise a fraction of the women to levy accusations against the Tinseltown titan since October 2017 - when The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposés of his alleged sexual misdeeds.
Weinstein's legal team sought to undermine his accusers' credibility while painting him as the victim.
"There was so much political pressure to charge Weinstein that it is reasonable for his attorneys to argue that the DA would not have pursued the case if it were a different defendant," said Roiphe. "That said, sometimes prosecutors do charge aggressively, knowing it will be a hard case to win, in order to send a message."
Jurors heard from Emmy-winning actress Annabella Sciorra of "The Sopranos," who became the first woman to accuse the fallen movie mogul of rape before a jury. She appeared as a witness to show a pattern of predatory behavior by Weinstein.
In painstakingly graphic detail, the Brooklyn-bred actress alleged that Weinstein brutally raped her in the bedroom of her Gramercy Park apartment after forcing his way inside during the winter of 1993-94.
"[I was] punching him, kicking him, just trying to get him away from me and he took my hands and put them over my head," Sciorra testified through tears. "And he got on top of me and he raped me."
Jurors would hear similar narratives in the weeks to come: Weinstein's accusers describing how the Hollywood heavyweight lured them into his orbit with promises of movie roles or high-flying positions in the entertainment industry.
After the alleged assaults, they said he threatened retribution - promising to derail their careers if they ever spoke up.
On Jan. 27, Haley took the stand and explicitly described how Weinstein sexually assaulted her in his SoHo loft in 2006 and pressured her into unwanted sex two weeks later in a Tribeca hotel room.
Four days later, Mann testified that Weinstein had raped her twice in 2013 - first in a Manhattan hotel, and again in a Beverly Hills hotel.
Mann's testimony, which spanned approximately 16 hours over three days, detailed her complex and volatile relationship with Weinstein. The shifting nuances of their friendship subjected her to a ruthless cross-examination by defense attorney Donna Rotunno.
"I know the history of my relationship," Mann told jurors. "I own my behavior."
Former cocktail waitresses Tarale Wulff and Dawn Dunning (left) took the stand to offer accounts that mirrored one another in descriptions of Weinstein's grooming techniques - yet differed greatly in their severity.
Wulff testified that he pulled her from the floor at Cipriani's SoHo and forced her to watch him masturbate on an unused terrace at the restaurant. She said that he later lured her to his SoHo loft and raped her in the summer of 2005.
Dunning said the larger-than-life producer forcefully groped her in a makeshift hotel room office in the spring of 2004. Weeks later, she alleged that he offered her three film roles to have a threesome with his assistant - telling Dunning it was how stars Salma Hayek and Charlize Theron found success in their careers.
Young, whose accusations make up part of the charges Weinstein faces in his Los Angeles case, alleged that she was coaxed to the "Reservoir Dogs" producer's Beverly Hills hotel room in February 2013 by Mexican model Claudia Salinas, who would trap her in a bathroom where Weinstein proceeded to sexually assault her.
Weinstein's defense attorneys called Salinas to rebut Young's testimony, and the witness denied the incident in its entirety. The disparate tales told to the jury only point out the importance of witness credibility, said Roiphe.
"Rape is a hard crime to prove because it almost always occurs in private, without witnesses," the lawyer explained. "Physical evidence or testimony by law enforcement witnesses who interviewed the victim immediately after the assault help prosecutors prove many rape cases.
"But, where, as in the Weinstein case, no such evidence exists, it comes down to the credibility of the accuser."

Texto completo: I love being able to draw and make money, but then I think there is a whole business side of it that is a lot less fun."
Jennifer Xiao
Freelance illustrator
The cartoony, colorful and bright style of Jennifer Xiao, a freelance illustrator, took over the projector screen in the Union Ballroom on Feb. 12. Florida State University students joined Xiao for an evening of insider details behind her story of becoming a successful full-time illustrator and self-boss in New York City.
To begin her story, Xiao time-traveled to her early childhood by showing baby pictures and youthful drawings to give the audience a starting point that explains how she ended up where she is today. She expressed her passion for creating drawings as a child and how her supportive parents turned one of her early masterpieces turned into a luggage tag.
Xiao turned her once-crayoned scribbles into professional illustrations, which has progressed into her full-time career. She has been recognized by noteworthy publications such as The New York Times and The New Yorker, and explained to the audience that her commissioned work came from putting her art on social media and through recommendations by professors and peers. Her advice is to "never be afraid to show your work, [because] you never know what might happen" to aspiring artists and freelancers.
Although Xiao has built her brand through her social media presence and networking opportunities, she does not hide the fact that her life as an illustrator in the Big Apple is not the glamorous and exciting narrative many might perceive. She got personal with the crowd during her Q&A by acknowledging the stress she experiences working on her own, and the mixed emotions of relying on social media to boost her art to find financial support.
"I love being able to draw and make money, but then I think there is a whole business side of it that is a lot less fun," expressed Xiao.
Xiao expanded on the business aspect of being a freelance artist and where her income comes from. She revealed that editorial jobs and paid pieces come to her very randomly and she mostly supports herself through creating merchandise such as stickers, pins, and posters through her online shop.
She had the audience laughing with her transparent and relaxed story of navigating a career based on personal expression and hard work. "A lot of my drawings are inspired by what I'm feeling in the moment," she explained, as she flipped through different illustrations of somber comics.
The recent graduate connected with her audience of university students when she explained her process of learning on the job and her road ahead of growth. Xiao has made impressive achievements within her blooming career as an artist, but she is candid with the fact that she is no pro just yet.
Jennifer Xiao gave a humbling presentation on her beginning career, and lifelong hobby, as an illustrator of quirky and fun pieces. The hard-working freelancer shared her journey and advice to students aspiring to build their own career in the future.
I love being able to draw and make money, but then I think there is a whole business side of it that is a lot less fun."

Texto completo: The lights ascended upon the stage at the Fallon Theatre, revealing a neighborhood salon filled with gossip, your one-stop-shop for café con leche and The New York Times, a surviving family-owned limousine business and the rooftops and side streets of Washington Heights, a quaint region of New York containing a community that is primarily Latino.
Director Chari Arespacochaga and the School of Theatre's production of "In the Heights" gives you the chance to see the splendor and strife of this tight-knit neighborhood as they navigate exactly what home is to them: kitschy conversations in the salon, a college campus across the country, an apartment on West 4th Street, the arms of a loved one. As disasters occur, this corner of New York puts their devotion to one another to the test as tension heightens and decisions must be made that change the fates of various characters.
Santos Sanchez brings to life Usnavi de la Vega, the owner of a popular bodega in Washington Heights, while Ali Cole carries herself as the studious and intellectual first-generation college student attending Stanford University returning home for the summer. This opportunity has been like no other for these students. "I think Santos and I can both agree that we're so blessed to be able to tell our stories on that stage, even if we're not theatre majors," Cole said.
Sanchez and Cole noted some of their favorite parts of the show, including the emotional ballad "Hundreds of Stories" (Sanchez) and the prideful cultural celebration taking place in the streets, "Carnaval del Barrio" (Cole). For Stage Manager Julia Bodolay, her favorite part lies in the community of performers that has developed: "I am so grateful for the opportunity to work with so many different people on this production."
With over just over 170 hours of rehearsals and practice, meticulously logged by Bodolay, the School of Theatre's the cast and crew detailed just how much time and dedication was required in order to perfect the show audiences will see come Feb. 14.
"Ali and I both agree that the most challenging part of this process was the pacing," explained Sanchez. Cole agreed, speaking to the unusual amount of holidays and breaks taking place in the midst of rehearsals. "We're expected to take a note and apply it right away," Cole added. "I appreciate the challenge, and being treated like a professional actor."
As opening night arrives, the cast and crew want the audience to really listen and absorb the sense of community, culture and identity exhibited in "In the Heights." "This musical is so important in our current political climate and illustrates one neighborhood's ability to stand together in the face of adversity, heartbreak, and triumph," said Bodolay.
Sanchez, in agreement, expressed that "my biggest wish is for audiences to leave with a piece of the love and joy we all share on stage in el barrio."
Through dynamic and powerful music complete with lively and relatable characters, immaculate set design and staging and show-stopping choreography "In the Heights" carries you through "a couple of days in the life of what it's like en Washington Heights."
Meet Usnavi (Santos Sanchez) and Benny (Ramone Nelson).

Texto completo: A talent showcase for middle and high school students will be part of a community event in Lancaster being held as part of Black History Month, Nelson Polite Jr., one of the organizers, says.
The fourth annual Freedom of Art evening is scheduled for 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 27, at Trinity Lutheran Church, 21 S. Duke St.
The talent competition is open to all individuals and groups in middle or high school who want to showcase their talent: singing, dancing, rapping, playing a musical instrument, presenting written or spoken word, painting, graphic arts and more, Polite says.
There will be cash prizes of $200 for first place, $150 for second and $100 for third.
The event, which is sponsored by the Polite Family Community Association, is free and open to the public. A meal will also be served for those attending, Polite says.
The Polite association is under the auspices of the Lancaster County Community Foundation.
There will be two speakers for the evening.
• J. Dwight Yoder, a partner in the law firm of Gibbel, Kraybill & Hess, will do a presentation based on “The 1619 Project” that ran in August 2019 New York Times. The project, which marked the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery, dealt with the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
• Nyisha Hammond, owner of the Juisibox cold-pressed juice company, will do a presentation titled "Cultivating Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and African-American Youth."
Polite says the Freedom of Art event is a continuation of the youth-mentoring work of his late father, civil rights activist and former Lancaster city council president, Nelson Polite Sr.
The deadline for entering the talent showcase is Thursday, Feb. 20. Young people who want to participate in the showcase should contact Polite by phone or text 717-615-3874 or Polite7@Comcast.net.

Bloomberg’s charitable donations went to cities whose mayors he then asked for 2020 endorsements

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg’s philanthropic donations over the years have helped the billionaire Democratic presidential candidate secure allegiance from city and party leaders who might otherwise find parts of his record problematic if they were not dependent on his charitable giving.
Bloomberg’s philanthropy skyrocketed in 2019, ahead of the former New York City mayor declaring his candidacy for president. Bloomberg donated $3.3 billion last year, which was more than he gave the previous five years combined, according to a New York Times analysis of his charitable donations.
The donations fall in line with his personal interests, but they are also fused with his political fixations, including public health and safety, education, climate change, and culture and arts.
Bloomberg Philanthropies, his charity, has supported nearly 200 cities with grants and other assistance worth $350 million. Dozens of the charity’s employees have also joined his campaign and are now reaching out to mayors of the cities that received the grants for their backing of Bloomberg’s campaign.
More than 100 current and former mayors have endorsed Bloomberg, according to his campaign, some of whom attended the candidate’s leadership initiative at Harvard University and received millions in funding from Bloomberg over the years.
Mayor Svante Myrick of Ithaca, New York, said Bloomberg’s campaign reached out shortly after he announced his candidacy to ask for an endorsement. The city had previously received $100,000 in funding for a supervised injection facility. Myrick, who has yet to endorse a candidate, said it did not initially occur to him that Bloomberg’s charitable donations could be linked to the endorsements.
“Maybe I should be thinking about: If I endorse Bloomberg, Bloomberg Philanthropies will give us more money,” he said.
Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville, Kentucky, has worked with Bloomberg’s team since 2011. Since then, his city has received $4.7 million in grants, and Fischer is now helping Bloomberg reach out to other cities strapped for financial resources. Louisville was one of five cities to receive funding from Bloomberg’s foundation for early childhood learning programs last year.

Bloomberg has used the grants to guide his campaign travel. One of his first campaign events was in Jackson, Mississippi, which received a $1 million grant as the winner of the foundation’s public art challenge and whose mayor attended Bloomberg’s Harvard program. He later visited Augusta, Georgia, to announce the endorsement of the city’s mayor, who also benefited from Bloomberg’s initiatives.
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who has participated in Bloomberg’s Harvard program, said she and her staff have worked to keep their ties to Bloomberg separate from political considerations.
“We view them as valued partners, but that’s got to be separate and apart from any presidential considerations,” she said.
Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg spokesman, said the billionaire businessman had made the donations “with no expectations of anything in return.”

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is after 'Anonymous'

Texto completo: Peter Navarro is hunting for the mysterious Trump administration official behind the anonymous tell-all book and critical New York Times opinion piece about the White House.
The White House trade adviser initiated his own unofficial investigation to root out "Anonymous" alongside several others, according to the Daily Beast. White House counsel Pat Cipollone is leading the administration’s official investigation to comb through the ranks of officials to identify the author. A group of National Security Council staffers is also conducting a search.
Navarro has compiled writing samples from a number of officials in the administration and had the samples compared to Anonymous’s column and book, focusing on how the author constructs sentences and uses certain phrases. Sources familiar with Navarro’s investigation said he has identified one suspect and delivered his findings in a report given to Cipollone.
Anonymous is known only as a senior Trump administration official who wrote a critical September 2018 New York Times column, as well as a book titled A Warning.
Both works are critical of the Trump administration and talk of a “resistance” inside the administration working to thwart President Trump.
The identity of Anonymous has eluded reporters and government officials since the New York Times opinion piece appeared. Trump has used the article to bolster allegations that some in his administration, including Obama holdovers, are working against his agenda.
Last week, former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova, a lawyer whose work has been caught up in the Ukraine-impeachment controversy, said he and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were told by "a senior government official" that "Anonymous" had been identified as an official working in the White House and would be removed "soon."
In recent weeks, Trump has taken action to remove multiple officials from his orbit who have been critical of him. Trump stripped Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman of his National Security Council role and recalled U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland from his post at the European Union after both officials testified against Trump in the House Democrats' impeachment investigation.

Maureen Dowd: Trump vs. Bloomberg is the battle of the meme girls

Texto completo: Washington • In a meta master stroke, Tina Fey made an epic teen movie, “Mean Girls,” in 2004, then turned it into a Broadway musical and is now making a movie out of the musical.
She should do her first casting call here. Politics has never been filled with so many mean girls.
How’s this for a bitch yyy lunch table? Mitch McConnell, Rudy Giuliani, Don Jr., Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham, John Bolton, Jim Jordan, Kellyanne Conway, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.
Of course Donald Trump, who uses Twitter like the Burn Book, takes the form of Regina George, Queen Bee.
Now comes the new kid in school: Mike Bloomberg, who wants to topple the Queen Bee and is aiming to get there with mean girl — and meme girl — tactics.
Many rivals have struggled to spar with Trump in debates and on Twitter but have found it difficult, demeaning and self-destructive to sink to his level.
They don’t seem authentic when the claws come out and the fur flies. Who can forget Marco Rubio stooping to a joke about Trump’s penis size and then apologizing, saying it wasn’t really who he was?
Another example of a rival getting unbalanced by Trump’s bullying: Hillary still wonders if she should have wheeled around, when Trump was lurking behind her on the debate stage and making her skin crawl, and said, “Back up, you creep, get away from me.” She overthought it, fearing she would come across as overwrought.
Bloomberg, however, has no such qualms. He can be a bitch when he wants to be. (And certainly, he has gotten in trouble crossing the line on offensive comments to female staffers and on stop-and-frisk.)
When Bloomberg was asked recently about the clash of the billionaires, he snapped back: “Who’s the other one?”
Trump, who tweeted in 2012 that Bloomberg was doing a great job as mayor of New York, is now scratching Bloomy’s eyes out. (The president’s post-acquittal megalomania and tweets about softening Roger Stone’s punishment have spurred Bill Barr and Republican senators to urge Trump to cut down the bullying, incendiary tweets. King Donald tweeted back that he can do as he likes. In the spirit of the Brangelina split, conservatives are now left agonizing about which of their stars to support — Trump or Barr.)
The president has been on a prolonged tweet rant about “Mini Mike” and his “vanity project,” claiming his “loser” billionaire rival with “zero presence” wants to stand on a box at the debates. A Bloomberg spokeswoman punched back about Trump: “He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.” (Michael Dukakis did stand on a specially built mound.)
This past week, Trump tweeted that “Mini Mike is a 5’4” mass of dead energy,” to which Bloomberg trash-tweeted back: “We know many of the same people in NY. Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown. They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence.”
As Charlie Warzel wrote in The Times’ Opinion section, “On Twitter, where some Democratic hopefuls have adopted a ‘they go low, we go high’ mentality, Bloombergians have instead opted to wade into the mud and wrestle with Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed.”
Bloomberg has dumped over $188 million into his campaign so far, including a million dollars a day on Facebook ads. A chunk has been thrown at an innovative digital campaign that taps legions of Instagram’s most prolific meme-makers to flood social media with ironic jokes designed to make the 78-year-old Bloomberg seem hip and to get millennials talking about him.
Like the mean tweets, the memes are a success in that people are talking (and DM-ing) about Bloomberg. But, like the mean tweets, they have been grating for some digital natives, who mock the naked bid to buy affection as condescending and inorganic.
The two candidates who inspire the greatest number of memes and web warriors are, funnily enough, two of the oldest men ever to run for president, Bernie Sanders, 78, and Trump, 73. And they don’t have to pay for their meme-makers.
“Bloomberg’s memes are comical in the worst possible way,” said Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign. “Paying for internet influencers and memes proves you don’t understand how meme culture works. President Trump’s supporters create content for free out of genuine love for the president.”
And the president loves his meme-meisters back. Last summer, he invited a bunch of these masters of vicious trolling, conspiracy theories and doctored videos to the White House for a festive social media summit — an ogre with all his digital goblins kickin’ it in the cave.
“The Trumpistas have been buying social media exposure for years,” said Tim O’Brien, a Trump biographer and former Bloomberg reporter who now is a senior adviser to the Bloomberg campaign. “It’s the only tactic that they actually stay focused on and try to build a strategy around. The idea that there is some grassroots movement funding this is silly.”
There’s no question that it’s going to get really nasty as these two oligarchs go at it, now that the nastiest place ever — the internet — has become the foreground of political campaigning. The real question is: Who can make fetch happen?

Texto completo: Idris Goodwin is many things: poet, playwright, hip-hop artist, theater director, educator.
And now he’s one more: director of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College.
The former CC assistant professor of theater started last week in the new position on a part-time basis and will officially take over May 1, relieving the duties of FAC director Erin Hannan, who announced her departure in November.
“What I’m interested in is galvanizing a conversation and bringing different people together in the arts,” says Goodwin. “I’m into creative community building. This job is a platform to do that in exciting ways. The FAC is this historic venue. Its founders wanted the Front Range to have really dynamic art that was available to everyone. The West is an interesting place that has so many stories people don’t know. There’s a great opportunity to tell the story of our part of the country. The campus can not only serve the city, but can speak to the whole world.”
From 2012 to 2018, Goodwin taught playwriting, hip-hop aesthetics, spoken word writing and more in the CC Department of Theatre and Dance. From there, he left town and became the producing artistic director of StageOne Family Theatre in Louisville, Ky.
Goodwin rose to the top of the candidate pool during a time of transition for the FAC. It was announced in 2016 that the nonprofit institution would be fully integrated into CC by July 1. Whoever was named director would need the experience and ability to engage on the academic side with the college and also maintain and grow the community side of the organization.
“It was a tough call. We’re asking someone to fill a bunch of shoes,” says CC Provost Alan Townsend. “We’re excited he’s interested in coming back. He’s a really remarkable person in a number of ways. He’s an influential artist. He’s got a big vision, great connections and community ties here.”
Goodwin’s work is produced across the country and has been recognized by the National Endowment for the Arts, The New York Times, National Public Radio and others. He’s performed his poetry on HBO’s “Def Poetry Jam” and PBS’ “Sesame Street,” and written award-winning plays, including “And in This Corner... Cassius Clay,” which received the 2017 Distinguished Play Award from The American Association of Theater and Education. Last year, TheatreWorks produced his new show, “American Prom.”
Several books of his poetry and essays also have been published, including the 2011 “These are the Breaks,” which was nominated for a Pushcart Prize.
While Goodwin will always have a national career, he says, making sure others flourish is also important to him.
“Being a director is about others shining, others succeeding, helping to bring everyone’s game up,” he says. “If our space is vibrant and exciting and representative of the region, and they’re coming through our space and talking about it and tweeting about it in the streets, and we’re seeing the impact over a long period of time, that means to me we’re doing our job. That’s what I’m after. That to me is success.”

Texto completo: LEBANON, N.H. — Micah Wexler runs a fine barbershop here in this calm, old city hard by the Connecticut River and Vermont border.
The Lebanon Barber Shop is as comfortable as it is unpretentious. The customers are remarkably normal, many of them regular working men with regular families. They come here because Wexler is a good guy and good barber, the conviviality is unforced, and a men's regular will set you back only 11 bucks.
And so, I am shocked beyond words that no one from the BBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, FOX, or any other organization with such letters managed to show up here with cameras in tow to ask Wexler and his customers how they intended to vote in the First in the Nation presidential primary.
Just about everybody who lives in New Hampshire gets some face time in the run-up to the primary. When the cameras run out of people to interview, they interview the moose, who, from my experience, tend to be independents.
Before the primary, Wexler dodged a TV crew that had set up in the pedestrian walkway outside the building that houses his barbershop. He caught a glimpse of Andrew Yang, who had a campaign office in his building. But in what some various Granite State chambers of commerce might consider heresy, Wexler's not a big fan of the First in the Nation primary.
“I don't know why everybody just can't vote on the same day," he said.
Good question.
And, as another Presidents' Day comes and goes, it's a good time to consider the process we use to pick our presidents.
It's nuts. Absolutely bonkers. The British, from whom we borrowed much before and after we threw them out, manage to hold their general election campaigns in a matter of weeks. We take two years, saturating the airwaves with stupid ads, making our campaigns more about money than ideas.
First in the Nation is more or less the New Hampshire Economic Recovery Act. The amount of money — the amount of attention — pumped into the local economy is nothing to sneeze at.
But there's far less money and attention to go around to other states, like those who vote on Super Tuesday.
All the candidates pour a ridiculous amount of money into New Hampshire, a state that is hardly reflective of the rest of the country, and if they get spanked, their campaigns are effectively over because then, of course, they can't raise money for the other primaries.
It's not just about money. It's also about attention. First in the Nation status confines so much of these deep journalistic dives to the deep woods of New Hampshire, while there's far less resources put into the rest of the country.
But it's way more about money.
As my colleague Shirley Leung noted in a column about how local TV stations (interestingly, the Boston ones more than WMUR, New Hampshire's only station) raked in millions in ad revenue, Tom Steyer spent almost $18 million on ads and ended up with what amounted to spending $1,671 per vote.
Heck, if he gave me half of that I would have gladly boarded one of those secret buses Trump keeps talking about and cast a ballot for the next president of the United States, Tom Steyer!
When First in the Nation primary day finally, mercifully, came along, Micah Wexler loaded his kids into the car, taking them to the polling station so they could learn about the importance of fulfilling a civic duty. As they were walking into the town hall in Enfield, N.H., his 8-year-old daughter Emma pulled him aside and asked him not to vote for Tom Steyer.
When Wexler asked why, his daughter said Steyer's incessant Internet advertising kept interfering with her and her friends' watching stuff on YouTube.
Emma Wexler is a reasonable child. Tom Steyer could have had her support for a lot less than $1,671.
As reasonable Americans, we should be able to vote on the same primary day.

Texto completo: Las fuerzas policiales en Orange County, California, se han reafirmado en su oposición a ayudar a hacer cumplir las leyes federales migratorias después de que trascendieran los planes de la Administración Trump de enviar agentes especialmente entrenados a ciudades santuario.
El departamento de Policía de la ciudad de Santa Ana y la oficina del sheriff del condado de Orange dijeron a Fox 11 Los Angeles que no participarían en actividades relacionadas con inmigración. La portavoz del condado de Orange dijo que el deber de la institución a la que representa es velar por la seguridad de las personas “independientemente de su ciudadanía “.
El anuncio de ambas agencias lega tres días después de que The New York Times publicara que el Gobierno de Donald Trump planea enviar a las llamadas ciudades santuario 100 oficiales de la oficina de Aduanas y Control Fronterizo (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) para que ayuden a los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) a capturar a inmigrantes indocumentados.
CBP enviaría a sus agentes a las ciudades californianas de Los Ángeles y San Francisco entre febrero y mayo de este 2020, según la información del Times.
Agentes de la Unidad Táctica de la Patrulla Fronteriza (BORTAC) serían algunos de los enviados a trabajar con ICE. Dicho equipo, según CBP, están preparados para responder a incidentes “de alto riesgo que requieran habilidades y tácticas especializadas”.

Texto completo: Jeff Bezos, el hombre más rico del mundo, anunció este lunes que invertirá parte de su fortuna a hacer frente a la emergencia climática . Bajo una nueva iniciativa que llamó Bezos Earth Fund, el magnate el magnate pondrá $10 mil millones de dólares al servicio de la ciencia y el ecologismo.
El fundador de Amazon, arrastrado a la preocupación por la emergencia climática gracias a sus empleados, anunció en su cuenta de Instagram que su intención es empezar a otorgar subvenciones este mismo verano .
“ El cambio climático es la mayor amenaza para nuestro planeta “, dijo Bezos al presentar su nuevo programa y hacer púbica su intención de contribuir con su fortuna “para ampliar los caminos conocidos y explorar otras formas de combatir el impacto devastador del cambio climático en este planeta que todos compartimos”.

Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ – Jeff
A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) onFeb 17, 2020 at 10:00am PST
El principal accionista de Amazon no ha sido hasta ahora un gran filántropo y ha preferido destinar sus millones a proyectos propios y empresas privadas como Blue Origin, que fabrica cohetes, y el diario The Washington Post.
A pesar de tener un patrimonio neto de $130 mil millones, según The New York Times, la mayor donación que ha hecho Bezos fue de dos mil millones de dólares para ayudar a las familias sin hogar y construir una red Montessori preescolar. Sin embargo, esta iniciativa la anunció en 2018 la que por entonces era su mujer, MacKenzie, de la que se divorció el año pasado.
En lo respectivo al activismo medioambiental, Bezos presentó el pasado septiembre su compromiso climático , según el cual Amazon alcanzaría los objetivos del Acuerdo de Paris 10 años antes de lo estipulado y sería neutral en carbono en 2040. Para ello, el magnate presumió de haber ordenado 100,000 camiones eléctricos de reparto a Rivan, una compañía con sede en Michigan en la que también a invertido.
Aunque los trabajadores de Amazon aplauden la filantropía de Bezos, creen que no es suficiente para realmente plantarle cara al desafío climático . Según el Times, el grupo de empleados de Amazon por la Justicia Climática dijeron este lunes que Amazon tiene que explicar cuándo “va a dejar de ayudar a las compañías de gas y de petróleo que asolan la tierra” y de “financiar a los centros de estudios que niegan el cambio climático como el Instituto de Empresa Competitiva.

Texto completo: Las fuerzas policiales en Orange County, California, se han reafirmado en su oposición a ayudar a hacer cumplir las leyes federales migratorias después de que trascendieran los planes de la Administración Trump de enviar agentes especialmente entrenados a ciudades santuario.
El departamento de Policía de la ciudad de Santa Ana y la oficina del sheriff del condado de Orange dijeron a Fox 11 Los Angeles que no participarían en actividades relacionadas con inmigración. La portavoz del condado de Orange dijo que el deber de la institución a la que representa es velar por la seguridad de las personas “independientemente de su ciudadanía “.
El anuncio de ambas agencias lega tres días después de que The New York Times publicara que el Gobierno de Donald Trump planea enviar a las llamadas ciudades santuario 100 oficiales de la oficina de Aduanas y Control Fronterizo (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) para que ayuden a los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) a capturar a inmigrantes indocumentados.
CBP enviaría a sus agentes a las ciudades californianas de Los Ángeles y San Francisco entre febrero y mayo de este 2020, según la información del Times.
Agentes de la Unidad Táctica de la Patrulla Fronteriza (BORTAC) serían algunos de los enviados a trabajar con ICE. Dicho equipo, según CBP, están preparados para responder a incidentes “de alto riesgo que requieran habilidades y tácticas especializadas”.

Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer.

A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) onFeb 17, 2020 at 10:00am PST
El principal accionista de Amazon no ha sido hasta ahora un gran filántropo y ha preferido destinar sus millones a proyectos propios y empresas privadas como Blue Origin, que fabrica cohetes, y el diario The Washington Post.
A pesar de tener un patrimonio neto de $130 mil millones, según The New York Times, la mayor donación que ha hecho Bezos fue de dos mil millones de dólares para ayudar a las familias sin hogar y construir una red Montessori preescolar. Sin embargo, esta iniciativa la anunció en 2018 la que por entonces era su mujer, MacKenzie, de la que se divorció el año pasado.
En lo respectivo al activismo medioambiental, Bezos presentó el pasado septiembre su compromiso climático , según el cual Amazon alcanzaría los objetivos del Acuerdo de Paris 10 años antes de lo estipulado y sería neutral en carbono en 2040. Para ello, el magnate presumió de haber ordenado 100,000 camiones eléctricos de reparto a Rivan, una compañía con sede en Michigan en la que también a invertido.
Aunque los trabajadores de Amazon aplauden la filantropía de Bezos, creen que no es suficiente para realmente plantarle cara al desafío climático . Según el Times, el grupo de empleados de Amazon por la Justicia Climática dijeron este lunes que Amazon tiene que explicar cuándo “va a dejar de ayudar a las compañías de gas y de petróleo que asolan la tierra” y de “financiar a los centros de estudios que niegan el cambio climático como el Instituto de Empresa Competitiva.

Texto completo: Al menos 30 personas fueron arrestadas durante una manifestación en contra de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ), los nuevas fuerzas especiales para detener a indocumentados y empresas que colaboran con la agencia para ubicar a inmigrantes.
Los activistas se reunieron el domingo frentre a la Biblioteca Pública de Nueva York, en la Calle 42, y caminaron hacia la Septima Avenida, donde están las oficinas de Thomson Reuters, agencia que tiene contratos co ‘La Migra’ para rastrear a indocumentados.
Los manifestantes cerraron la vialidad, por lo que elementos del Departamento de Policía ( NYPD ) detuvo a una treintena de los manifestantes, quienes portaban carteles con mensajes como “Cierren los campos”, en referencia a centros de retención, considerados los nuevos campos de concentración.

Los manifestantes también mencionaron el caso del hispano en Brooklyn a quienes agentes de ICE dispararon en el rostro, luego de que intervino en la detención de un inmigrante, quien es novio de su madre.
Activistas, como Matt Garczynski , señalaron que todos los ciudadanos deberían luchar en contra de los abusos a inmigrantes.
También criticaron a las empresas que se benefician al proporcionar datos personales que ayudan a los agentes de ICE a localizar a indocumentados.
“El sistema de detención y deportación en los Estados Unidos no podría funcionar sin la cooperación con las corporaciones”, dijo el organizador Andy Ratto a PIX11.
La presencia de ICE en Nueva York parece más intensa en las últimas semanas, sobre todo en medio de las políticas del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) contra “ciudades santuario”.
El gobierno de Andrew Cuomo es uno de los demandos por ‘La Migra’ por no compartir datos de inmigrantes detenidos por alguna falta o delito, a fin de que puedan ser deportados.
La semana pasada, el New York Times indicó que ICE tendrá el respaldo de agentes especiales de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) , a fin de mejorar el arresto de inmigrantes. La medida será implementada en al menos 11 ciudades y estados, incluidos Nueva York y Newark, Nueva Jersey.
El DHS también castigó a Nueva York con un bloqueo al sistema Global Entry por otorgar licencias a indocumentados. Más de 170,000 personas no pueden utilizar sus credenciales para facilitar cruces en aeropuertos, mientras Cuomo está en negociaciones con el gobierno del presidente Donald Trump .

Texto completo: Las fuerzas policiales en Orange County, California, se han reafirmado en su oposición a ayudar a hacer cumplir las leyes federales migratorias después de que trascendieran los planes de la Administración Trump de enviar agentes especialmente entrenados a ciudades santuario.
El departamento de Policía de la ciudad de Santa Ana y la oficina del sheriff del condado de Orange dijeron a Fox 11 Los Angeles que no participarían en actividades relacionadas con inmigración. La portavoz del condado de Orange dijo que el deber de la institución a la que representa es velar por la seguridad de las personas “independientemente de su ciudadanía “.
El anuncio de ambas agencias lega tres días después de que The New York Times publicara que el Gobierno de Donald Trump planea enviar a las llamadas ciudades santuario 100 oficiales de la oficina de Aduanas y Control Fronterizo (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) para que ayuden a los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) a capturar a inmigrantes indocumentados.
CBP enviaría a sus agentes a las ciudades californianas de Los Ángeles y San Francisco entre febrero y mayo de este 2020, según la información del Times.
Agentes de la Unidad Táctica de la Patrulla Fronteriza (BORTAC) serían algunos de los enviados a trabajar con ICE. Dicho equipo, según CBP, están preparados para responder a incidentes “de alto riesgo que requieran habilidades y tácticas especializadas”.

Virginia Legislature turns down ban on military-style weapons

Texto completo: A bill that would have banned military-style rifles in Virginia was defeated in the state Senate on Monday, a sign of the limited power of the state's new Democratic majority in enacting the most restrictive elements of its gun-control agenda and a blow to Governor Ralph Northam's efforts to restrict gun possession.
The prohibition on military-style rifles was the most contentious of a series of gun-control bills making their way through the state Legislature this year and the centerpiece of Democrats' attempts to restrict firearms after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in Virginia Beach last May.
The state is at the heart of a long-simmering debate related to the nation's uneasy accommodation regarding gun laws, with Democrats in the state's urban areas and suburbs supporting gun-control measures, while many rural residents have mounted large gun-rights protests in response.
The assault-weapons bill rejected Monday would have prohibited the sale, purchase, manufacture, and most transfers of military-style weapons, and large-capacity magazines holding more than 12 rounds. It would have also banned trigger activators, including bump stocks, designed to make weapons simulate automatic machine-gun fire.
Four Democrats on the 15-member Senate Judiciary Committee joined six Republicans in voting to send the proposal to a state commission for further study. The measure is likely to be debated again next year, lawmakers said.
The Democrats represent both suburban and urban areas, and each of the lawmakers had supported other gun-control measures this session.
But one of the Democrats, R. Creigh Deeds, said there was discomfort in enacting an outright ban because lawmakers had failed to arrive at a consensus definition of what constitutes an assault weapon despite weeks of negotiations. Deeds said there remained “a lot of questions" about the definition.
The initial version of the measure would have prohibited all assault-style weapons in the state, which would have required owners to turn them in. But that version was recently overhauled to allow owners to keep their weapons.
On Monday, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group that organized a massive gun-rights rally at the Virginia State Capitol last month, praised the vote on Twitter.
“VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Van Cleave tweeted.

Miller nuptials illustrate difficulty of dating in D.C.
Stephen Miller and Katie Waldman, who met while he was developing the administration's restrictive immigration policies and she was working as a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, were married at President Trump's hotel Sunday evening.
The wedding details, dished out in increments by the bride to reporters over the past few months, illustrate what it meant for one notorious Trump aide to get married in a heavily Democratic town where the mere sight of him is known to create angry confrontations.
They hired security. Wedding invitations contained a card detailing the couple's privacy requests. The registry was created under a fake name. Invited friends who might bring unruly partisans as their guests to the wedding were screened.
In the end, the nuptials were stocked with Trump administration officials, including Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and the people who love the couple. (The people who don't love them created a hashtag that mocked the event for being held at the president's hotel.) The couple celebrated with monogrammed ice cubes, mutual statements of love, and a playlist selected by the groom.
“Spectacular and very special wedding tonight with new bride and groom Stephen and Katie Miller!" Reince Priebus, a former White House chief of staff, wrote on Twitter. “So much fun and still going with @RealDonaldTrump having fun and the band is going strong!"
But the scene reflected what has been an uncomfortable truth for young aides since the beginning of the administration: Washington's highly politicized culture — a reality that the president and zealous officials like Miller have directly contributed to — can be brutal on dating life. This mirrors a larger trend taking place throughout the rest of America, according to specialists: Singles, particularly members of the under-40 crowd, do not want to meet or match with people outside their political tribe.
For young aides in this White House, one solution seems to be to meet and marry each other, or at least endeavor to find love inside the political bunker of the Trump administration.

Trump campaign tweets old Daytona 500 photo
President Trump's campaign manager on Sunday tweeted, and later deleted, a photo of Air Force One ascending above a crowd of NASCAR fans in Florida. The president, he wrote, "won the #Daytona500 before the race even started."
The image, it turned out, was 16 years old.
Brad Parscale deleted the tweet about three hours later and posted another tweet with an updated photo.
The president and Melania Trump attended the annual race in Daytona Beach on Sunday. The president served as the event's grand marshal in what was widely seen as an opportunity to court his supporters in the swing state ahead of the November election.
"Rubber will burn, fans will scream, and the Great American Race will begin," the president said, before taking a lap on the track in his limousine, called "the Beast." He commanded drivers to start their engines, but the race was ultimately postponed to Monday because of rain.
The stands were filled with revelers, some wearing Trump 2020 T-shirts and hats. His visit marked the second appearance at the race by a sitting president. The last was in 2004, when President George W. Bush helped kick off the event.
Photographer Jonathan Ferrey was there that year and took the photo of Air Force One that Parscale originally tweeted.
"I have a lot of talented colleagues photographing the Daytona 500 this year," Ferrey told CNN. "I am unfortunately not there today, but apparently I won the Daytona 500 photography before the race even started."

Texto completo: Local football legend Jimmy Cefalo is returning to the area next month to serve as the keynote speaker at the 106th anniversary banquet of the Greater Pittston Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.
The dinner is slated for Tuesday, March 17, at the Woodlands Inn and Resort in Plains Twp., with cocktail hour starting at 5:30 p.m.
Cefalo starred as a wide receiver at Pittston Area High School and then Penn State University before going on to play with the Miami Dolphins in the National Football League.
“He’s a local guy who made it pretty big. It’s a big deal for us to have him back,” said Matt Meade, current president of the Pittston Friendly Sons. “It’s an honor to have him come up and share his story and get together with some of his former teammates.”
Meade noted he was a student at Pittston Area when the legendary Cefalo was in town years ago for the opening of the Cefalo athletic center at the football stadium.
“I never met the man personally. I’m excited to meet him,” Meade said.
Cefalo has always been recognized as a hometown hero by those in the Pittston community. His image is among the famous Pittstonians painted on a mural on the side of the former Newrose Hotel on Main Street. Cefalo was on hand for its unveiling in 2015. In 2016, he threw out the first pitch before a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders game. In 2017, he was named grand marshal of the Pittston Tomato Festival parade.
At Pittston Area, Cefalo was a consensus high school All-American and later was named as a member of The Pennsylvania Football News All-Century Team.
One of the country’s most highly recruited players, Cefalo wrote a series of articles for The New York Times about his life as a scholar athlete.
“I was 14 years old when the siege began and 17 when it ended. I received 2,856 pieces of mail, was contacted by six United States congressmen, the governor of Maryland, Hank Aaron, hundreds of businessmen and about 150 college football coaches,” Cefalo wrote about the recruitment process.
Cefalo was a standout at Penn State University from 1974 to 1977 under Coach Joe Paterno. He earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1978. When Joe Paterno died in 2011, Cefalo was asked to provide a eulogy.
Cefalo was a third-round draft choice of the Miami Dolphins in 1978. He played seven seasons and appeared in two Super Bowls. In 1984, Cefalo caught the Dan Marino pass that broke the most touchdown passes in a season record.
Following his playing career, Cefalo went on to become an Emmy award-winning radio and television broadcaster and writer. He’s now known as the “Voice of the Dolphins.” Cefalo also co-owns a television station, a production company and a specialty wine store.
“When I read his biography, I didn’t realize how much he did outside the sports world,” Meade said.
Tickets for the Friendly Sons dinner can be purchased through any member of the organization or can be bought at the Pittston Knights of Columbus any Thursday evening.

Baffling dip in life expectancy

Texto completo: A Times editorial

From 2014 to 2017, Americans life expectancy went down after about 60 years of largely going up. And the reason for that is even more concerning: rising death rates for Americans in the 25-to-64 age group. In the past, researchers traced the trend of more young people dying to largely white, rural areas. But a recent study shows younger Americans are dying more frequently in every racial and ethnic group in all areas of the country.

Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the 2018 life expectancy actually went up from 78.6 years to 78.7 years. But experts caution that the shift from one year to the other is not enough to discount overall worrying trends, like deaths in young people. From 2010 to 2017, more than 33,000 people have died in the United States in ages 25 to 64 than if mortality rates stayed the same or decreased. In general terms, that rate went up from 328.5 deaths for every 100,000 people between 25 and 64 in 2010 to 348.2 deaths for every 100,000 people seven years later. That was particularly high for those in the 25-to-34 age range, the youngest part of the midlife bracket. Deaths for young adults went up 29 percent from 2010 to 2017. The mid-life group appears to be disproportionately affected by deaths in the last decade, as researchers said mortality rates are actually getting better for children and older adults. Its just the people in this middle group that continue to die more frequently.

Researchers say the causes for death are so varying that the increasing mortality rates cant simply be blamed on one thing. They include drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides and physical conditions like heart disease, strokes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But not any one thing is the root cause, scientists say. Theyre so diverse that it makes us think something systemic is responsible and is expressing itself in our health in many different domains, said Dr. Steven Woolf, the lead author on the report, in an interview with NBC News. While the increasing midlife death rates are affecting all areas of the country, the largest increases are centered in two geographic areas: New England and the Ohio Valley. About a third of all midlife excess deaths from 2010 to 2017 occurred in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, areas in which the opioid crisis is keenly felt.

Worse still, America represents an exception to the rule when compared with other wealthy and developed countries. This is particularly shocking when considering that the United States has the highest per capita health spending in the world, reports the New York Times. Although the study focused only on parts of the last decade, the United States began experiencing higher midlife excess deaths than other countries as early as the 1970s, according to Woolf. This is a distinctly American phenomenon, he told NBC News.

While the results of the study depict a devastating trend, they yield as many questions as they answer. How can America improve? Some say the answer lies in America itself. After all, life expectancy in the coastal metro areas on the East and West coasts has still improved at about the same amount as Canada. Perhaps the next question is what can be gleaned from those areas such as New Hampshire and West Virginia, where some of the highest increases in mortality rates have occurred. The overall trends are disturbing, and the reasons need to be better identified to shape public policy and reverse those trends.

Texto completo: Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines are working with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Japanese health officials to trace the path of a couple from Nagoya, Japan, who were diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from Hawaii.
Hawaiian state health officials say the couple, who are in their 60s, were in Hawaii from Jan. 28 to Feb. 7 and tested positive after being hospitalized in Japan.
The man, who was diagnosed before his wife, flew on Hawaiian Airlines flight HA265 from Kahului, Hawaii, to Honolulu on Feb. 3, in addition to flying home on Delta flight 611 from Honolulu to Nagoya on Feb. 6 with his wife.
Delta spokesperson Adrian Gee told USA TODAY, "We are aware of reports that two customers who are being treated for novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) recently traveled together between Honolulu and Nagoya and we are communicating with the appropriate public health officials, including U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local Japanese authorities. "
Hawaiian spokesman Alex Da Silva told USA TODAY, "On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asked us for information regarding HA265 from Kahului to Honolulu on Feb. 3, 2020, which transported a Japanese visitor who had since become ill and, upon his return to Japan on another carrier later in the week, was diagnosed with COVID-19. "
He added that the airline was working with public health officials to notify passengers and had already contacted employees who worked that flight.
Hawaii's state health director, Bruce Anderson, said Friday that the couple was staying at Hilton Grand Vacations' Grand Waikikian on Oahu when the man began exhibiting symptoms on Feb. 3. He did not seek medical care at that time but was hospitalized upon his return to Japan and initially diagnosed with pneumonia before testing positive for coronavirus.
Hawaii's Department of Heath was later notified that the wife had been hospitalized, spokeswoman Janice Okubo told Hawaiian Public Radio. The Honolulu Star Advertiser and The New York Times and reported that she was diagnosed with the virus on Saturday.
State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said officials believe the man was infected either while still in Japan or on the flight to Hawaii because he developed symptoms approximately five days after his arrival. That timeline aligns with the CDC's current theory about the virus' incubation period.
“Our focus at this point is to try and understand who potentially this person may have had close, prolonged contact,” Park said, noting that that officials are focusing on the man's path while on Oahu since that is where he became symptomatic.
"Following the stay of a guest who was later diagnosed with COVID-19, the Grand Waikikian has implemented all recommendations of public health authorities," said Lauren George, the corporate communications director for Hilton Grand Vacations, an independent company which operates timeshares. "While the Grand Waikikian remains open as usual, we are also working with all current and future guests at the Grand Waikikian to ensure their comfort and safety. "
The news comes just a few days after Hilton announced it was temporarily closing 150 hotels in China, which translates to about 33,000 rooms.
Hawaiian officials say there are still no confirmed cases of the virus in the state. According to the CDC, the United States has 15 cases in seven states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington State and Wisconsin.
In Illinois, one patient who returned from the disease's epicenter in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 13 was found to have passed the virus to her husband, who did not make the trip, making him the first U. S. case of person-to-person transmission.
To date, Japan has had 66 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death. The virus has affected more than 71,000 people worldwide and killed 1,775 people as of Monday morning, according to Johns Hopkins data.

Texto completo: NORTH BEND, Ohio – You might consider the parade here earlier this month the equivalent of a participation trophy.
Of the 45 presidents the nation will honor Monday, none served as short a term as William Henry Harrison. He died just 31 days into his presidency and is buried in a tomb overlooking the Ohio River in this town 15 miles west of Cincinnati.
Despite a term so short that he left no imprint on the presidency itself, Harrison is still honored every year with a parade sometime around his Feb. 9 birthday. This year's featured the usual honor guard, marching members of a local Sons of the American Revolution chapter, and wreath-laying at the former president's tomb.
Robert Ruehlman, a local judge and North Bend resident who helps organize the parade, said it’s important to remember Harrison beyond even his time as president.
“He was an important figure in the war of 1812 and he was the first presidential candidate to use a slogan," Ruehlman said. That slogan: “Tippecanoe and Tyler too. ” (Tippecanoe was a battle Harrison fought in; Tyler was John Tyler, his running mate. )
Harrison, a Whig, can claim to be the answer to variety of historical trivia: he was the first president from Ohio, the grandfather of a later president (Benjamin Harrison,) and a pioneer when it came to presidential campaigns – chiefly by exaggerating his record.
In her biography "William Henry Harrison," author Gail Collins, the New York Times columnist and Green Township native, said, "Politically, Harrison's greatest achievement was to star in what is still celebrated as one of the most ridiculous presidential campaigns in history,"
He’s also a key figure in a new mystery.
A sword he carried at his inauguration that was used in the Revolutionary War by his father-in-law, John Cleves Symmes, disappeared for decades – until it turned up at a Connecticut auction last year. It was seized until authorities can answer the question: was it stolen, as local historians suggest, or was the seller the true owner. The FBI is investigating.
On March 4, 1841, Harrison gave the longest inaugural address in history (8,445 words). To show how hardy he was, he wore no overcoat, hat or gloves in the freezing temperatures.
Harrison caught pneumonia and died on April 4, after just 31 days in office.
At this year's parade and wreath-laying, North Bend's mayor Douglas Sammons said Harrison would have a message for the nation if he were alive today.
"In our present day, the United States seems to have become a more polarized country," Sammons said. "Even when we disagree, it does not mean we should be disagreeable. If President Harrison was alive today, I do not think he would appreciate where our country's discourse is. "

Texto completo: American passengers on Sunday frantically prepared to evacuate a cruise ship that has been quarantined for more than 10 days in the Japanese port city of Yokohama as hundreds of people on board fell ill with the coronavirus.
As the Americans scrambled to pack their bags and prepare their own meals for a chartered flight to the United States, Japanese health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases found on the ship, the Diamond Princess, had grown by 70, to 355.
"Can't get off here fast enough," Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, California, told reporters on Sunday.
The U.S. Embassy in Japan had recommended that American citizens stay aboard the ship during a 14-day quarantine period. But it suddenly changed course on Saturday, citing "a rapidly evolving situation" as conditions appeared to worsen.
American passengers said they were told to prepare to leave the ship at 9 p.m. local time. Their flight was scheduled to depart Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 3 a.m. Monday. Officials said they would be taken to one of two military air bases in the United States.
But the process, taken deck by deck, went slowly. By close to 11 p.m., many were still waiting in their rooms.
Passengers on the charter were told there would be no overhead luggage space on the flight, so all carry-ons had to fit under the seats in front of them, and shipped luggage could not exceed 70 pounds. They would be flying on a converted 747 cargo plane, the officials said, which could be cold, so they were advised to shower and dress warmly for the flight. They were also advised to bring their own food.
Late in the afternoon, as buses lined up on the pier, American officials dressed in protective suits knocked on the cabin doors of American citizens to inform them that they needed to put their luggage out at 6 p.m. to prepare for the 9 p.m. transfer.
Rachel Torres, 24, who had been on her honeymoon with her husband, Tyler, also 24, said they were trying to clean their stateroom so as not to leave a mess.
"We didn't sleep much last night," said Rachel Torres. In preparation for the flight, she said, the couple were "drinking as much water as we can to hydrate for the flight since we will be wearing masks on the plane."
Including the cases aboard the Diamond Princess, Japan has recorded the highest number of infections from the new coronavirus outside mainland China. Worldwide, more than 68,500 people have been infected, and at least 1,669 have died, almost all in mainland China.
When the ship was placed under quarantine, more than 3,700 passengers and crew were on board, including about 400 Americans.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said those with coronavirus infections or symptoms would not be allowed to take the chartered flight.
Once in the United States, the passengers will be required to undergo a two-week quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, or Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio.
Those who do not take the charter will not be allowed to travel to the United States until March 4, two weeks after they would have otherwise been allowed to leave the ship on Wednesday, the embassy said.
With at least 40 Americans from the ship having tested positive for the coronavirus during the quarantine period, some will be left behind in Japan when the charter flights depart.

Texto completo: In an email a few days ago to the 270 lawyers he oversees, Nicola T. Hanna, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, offered a message of reassurance: I am proud of the work you do, he wrote.
Other U.S. attorneys in the Justice Department's 93 field offices relayed similar messages of encouragement after President Donald Trump's efforts to influence a politically fraught case provoked the kind of consternation the department has rarely seen since the Watergate era.
But the fact that the department's 10,000-odd lawyers needed reassurances seemed like cause for worry all by itself.
In more than three dozen interviews in recent days, lawyers across the federal government's legal establishment wondered aloud whether Trump was undermining the Justice Department for upholding the law without favor or political bias -- and whether Attorney General William Barr was able or willing to protect it.
Trump elicited those fears by denouncing federal prosecutors who had recommended a prison sentence of up to nine years for his longtime friend and political adviser Roger Stone. Barr fanned them by scrapping the recommendation in favor of a far more lenient one, leading the prosecutors to quit the case in protest.
Barr then took to national television to complain that Trump's angry tweets were undermining him and his department's credibility -- a sign to some current and former lawyers that the department's freedom from political influence is in imminent danger.
As many of the department lawyers and some recently departed colleagues see it, Barr has devoted much of his authority and stature to bolster the president since he took office a year ago.
While he has pledged that the department will not pursue politically motivated investigations, Barr said this month that he had created an "intake process" for the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to forward supposed proof of misconduct in Ukraine. Giuliani has claimed to have evidence damaging to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
This month, Barr ordered reviews of several politically sensitive cases handled by career prosecutors in Washington, including that of the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, which has become a flash point for pro-Trump activists.
Meanwhile, Barr's expansive view of presidential authority has helped Trump fight off congressional oversight. It was the Justice Department, for instance, that decided it was unnecessary to give Congress the whistleblower complaint that ultimately led to the president's impeachment.
Barr's critics say those and other moves have all but invited increasingly aggressive demands from the White House. His supporters in the Justice Department counter that he has used his political capital to protect the department and national security interests. But they sound increasingly worried about whether he will be able to manage the expectations of an ever more volatile president.
Barr's effort to scale back those expectations, officials said, was born of necessity. He is said to have told the president privately that he will not open politically inspired inquiries on Trump's behalf and that the president's public comments about specific criminal cases are damaging the department's work.
When the president's public outburst over the prosecutors' sentencing recommendation for Stone made it clear that Barr's message had not sunk in, Barr and a few trusted advisers elected to deliver it again in a way that has repeatedly proved effective in grabbing the president's attention: on television, this time in a nationally broadcast interview with ABC News.
By the end of the week, many at the Justice Department's headquarters were uncertain whether that interview would resolve what some called an increasingly untenable situation. Some steeled themselves for a stream of presidential invective or even Barr's departure in response.
In the legal trenches where the department's lawyers handle controversial cases daily,, some expressed relief that Barr had defended the department and tried to set boundaries for a president seemingly intent on erasing the red line between political motivations and individual criminal cases that has prevailed since Watergate.
"Thank God," one lawyer said. "I was beginning to be really upset over the sentencing, but I really admire that he told Trump to shut up," said another. A third wrote in a memo: "Barr was EXACTLY right."
But others questioned Barr's sincerity, saying he was already too closely aligned with Trump's political priorities to accept his words at face value.

Texto completo: There's an old Edwardian home in Pelham, New York, with strong ties to the nation's first president as well as its 34th, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The home, at 328 Cliff Ave., is now listed for sale for $2.688 million. "When I put a house on the market I like to dig in and see what kind of history it has," said listing agent Arthur Scinta of Houlihan Lawrence. Using just the address, he discovered that the house was owned by William E. Robinson, a New York Herald Tribune executive and later president of the Coca-Cola Company, in the 1940s and '50s. That led to Robinson's New York Times obituary and a 2014 Times article, "The Gang That Always Liked Ike" by presidential historian Michael Beschloss.
It turns out that Robinson and Eisenhower were quite close friends and golfing buddies for many years and that the president was a sometime guest in the house at 328 Cliff Ave. in Pelham.
Betty Bucher, who lived with her parents in a house across the street from the Robinsons, remembers seeing the president walk his Scottish terrier on the Cliff Avenue sidewalks one weekend, with Secret Service agents in tow.
"There was a lot of security," she said. "I remember three cars with Secret Service agents."
"Sometimes it's interesting and sometimes it's like, wow," said Scinta, about the results of his research into house histories. "This was a wow."
President George Washington was also a frequent overnight guest in an earlier house owned by Col. Philip Pell III (1753-1811) where the Cliff Avenue dwelling now stands.
The Pell house, which was built in 1750 and destroyed in 1888, "was exactly on the site where this house is now," Scinta said.
Pell was a descendant of Thomas Pell, the founder of Pelham and first "Lord of Pelham Manor." At that time. the Pells owned all of the present town of Pelham, Scinta said. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Pell served as deputy judge advocate general under Gen. Washington. He rode triumphantly with Washington into New York City the day the British evacuated the city at the end of the war, according to a 1946 history of Pelham by Lockwood Barr that Scinta describes as "the definitive history of Pelham."
"There was a very strong relationship between Pell and Washington," Scinta said. "He was his aide-de-camp."
After the war, Washington slept at the Pell home on "numerous occasions," according to Barr's book.
History aside, the 7,019-square-foot Cliff Avenue home, which has eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, "is about my favorite house in Pelham," Scinta said. Its 0.82-acre lot is particularly large for the village.
"This house literally takes your breath away," he said. "It's so architecturally distinct and with such great proportions – it's got an incredible feel to it."
Also, "it sits up really high," well above its neighbors, he said. "The Pells could have built anywhere and this is where they chose to build their house."
The first owner of the current house, which was built in 1914, was American Express President George C. Taylor, who bought the home in 1915, the year he was promoted to president of the company, Scinta said. He had joined the company as a wagon driver at age 17 and worked his way to the top.
At some point after the Robinsons lived there, the house was used as the Barbados United Nations embassy.
"I actually bought it from the Barbados government," said current owner Nicole Browning, who took ownership in 1995 and began a major renovation to uncover and restore all of the original woodwork that had been painted or otherwise covered.
The Cliff Avenue house is close to Pelham's downtown and its elementary and middle/high school, Scinta said. "The walkability factor is off the charts."
"You're three blocks from the train station, you have an acre, and you have all of this privacy," he said. "As big as it is, it has an intimate feel."
Browning agrees. "To me it's this beautiful house that's very gracious and wonderful for entertaining – it has amazing flow," she said. "But it's so cozy – it feels like a real family house."
She also loves the quick train ride into New York City.
"I go into the city, sometimes twice a day," Browning said. "Everybody loves Brooklyn these days, but this is such an easier commute."
Architecture and design details now include leaded glass windows, a formal dining room with a fireplace, restored hardware and woodwork throughout, and a well-maintained tile roof.
The kitchen has granite countertops, high-end stainless steel appliances, an island and a butler's pantry.
"The master bath is like a spa," Scinta said.
The house is entirely clad in period ceramic tile that's a "low-luster green color, and you never have to paint it," Scinta said.
Other amenities include a detached two-car garage with second-floor living quarters, six working fireplaces, central air conditioning, an exercise and recreation area on the lower level, and multiple patios.
Browning "has lovingly restored it, and they really brought it back to life," Scinta said. "Nicole has a wonderful sense of design."
She's also a great gardener, he said. "Something is always in bloom."
That seems to run in the family. Her sister is former Pelham resident Dominique Browning, the longtime editor of the now-defunct House & Garden magazine.
Who was William Robinson?
William Robinson, a longtime editor at the New York Herald Tribune, first met Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in 1944, during World War II, when he was in Europe to reestablish publication of the paper's European edition.
They remained close friends for life, through Eisenhower's two-term presidency and after he left office, until they both died in 1969, according to papers at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas.
In 1947, Robinson persuaded the general to write his war memoirs, "Crusade in Europe," and then arranged for their publication in book form by Doubleday and syndicated to newspapers worldwide by the Herald Tribune.
"The two men were drawn together by a great admiration and respect for each other's ideas and judgments, and an abiding common passion for playing bridge and golf," according to an introduction to the Robinson Papers at the Eisenhower Library.
Beginning in 1948, Robinson worked to convince the general to run for president and recruit supporters to the idea. Along with a handful of other wealthy businessmen, Robinson became part of an informal group of advisers to the future president that called themselves "the Gang." They were also his primary golfing buddies.
Early in 1952, Eisenhower's business cronies helped organize a highly successful midnight rally at Madison Square Garden, which nudged him toward a run for the presidency that year, according to a 2014 article in the New York Times by historian Michael Beschloss.
Serving in Paris at the time as supreme commander of NATO, Eisenhower saw a film of the two-hour rally and then told a friend, with tears in his eyes, "You can go tell Bill Robinson that I'm going to run," according to Beschloss.
After the election on Nov. 4, 1952, Robinson accompanied Eisenhower to Georgia to play golf at Augusta National Golf Club, according to the Eisenhower Library. At the time, Robinson was living in the Cliff Avenue house in Pelham. He lived there from 1946 until 1955, listing agent Arthur Scinta said.
"Mr. Robinson's intimate association with President Eisenhower continued during his two terms in office," according to the Eisenhower Library. Press accounts that describe how the president relaxed "always named Bill Robinson as one of President Eisenhower's closest personal friends in whose company he could temporarily find relief from the constant pressures and burdens of the presidency."

Pistons are closer to lottery than playoff spot

Texto completo: ORLANDO – The undermanned Pistons are trying.
They go into the NBA All-Star break having lost four straight by an average of 5.75 points per game.
They took Oklahoma City, a playoff team in the powerful Western Conference, to the closing minutes.
In the final game before the break Wednesday night, they forced overtime against the Orlando Magic, a likely playoff team.
But with Blake Griffin out for the season and the recent trade of Andre Drummond, the Pistons are rebuilding.
The Pistons are 19-38 and six games behind the Magic for the Eastern Conference's eighth and final playoff spot.
With 25 games left, the Pistons are 12th in the Eastern Conference, closer to finishing fourth in lottery standings than a playoff spot.
With the postseason a pipe dream, here are three story lines for the Pistons' final games.
First top-five pick since Darko? According to Tankathon.com, the Pistons have the second toughest schedule remaining.
It's tough to see the Pistons, who are sixth in draft lottery odds, falling to the bottom three; the Hawks currently sit third in draft lottery odds with a 15-41 record, 31/2 games away from the Pistons.
But is the fourth-worst record possible?
The Timberwolves (16-37) are two games off the Pistons, but hold the tiebreaker by virtue of an early-season victory at Little Caesars Arena.
The Timberwolves added point guard D'Angelo Russell at the deadline so they should be better over the final games, but they have the seventh toughest schedule remaining.
The NBA's recent lottery reform puts finishing fourth on almost equal footing as a bottom-three finish.
The teams with the three worst records each have a 14% chance at landing the No. 1 overall pick.
The reform added the fourth-worst team to the lottery draw, and that team will have a 12.5% chance at landing the top pick.
A fourth-place finish in lottery odds would also give the Pistons a 37% chance of a top-three pick; there is a 55% chance of a top-five pick.
The Pistons' last top-five pick occurred in 2003 when Serbian big man Darko Milicic was taken second in a draft that produced future Hall of Famers LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.
No need to remind folks that Milicic is one of the worst picks in NBA history.
The NBA draft lottery will be held May 19 in Chicago.
Will Reggie Jackson remain? When asked about the possibility of a buyout after the loss at Oklahoma City, point guard Reggie Jackson gave a curt response.
"I haven't thought about it; I don't know who said that," Jackson said.
The New York Times' Marc Stein and Yahoo! Sports' Vincent Goodwill reported that a buyout is a possibility for Jackson, who will be a free agent this offseason.
A league source tells the Free Press that those discussions could begin following the break.
The Pistons would be open to the idea since it would save money. Nearly 70% of his $18 million salary has been paid.
There's a chance Jackson remains. It's fair to speculate the Pistons will shut down Derrick Rose at some point in the final 25 games.
Under such a scenario, the Pistons could use Bruce Brown and Brandon Knight to absorb point guard minutes, but Knight is often injured.
Two-way contract player Jordan Bone has struggled in limited opportunities and he's only allowed 45 days with the Pistons under CBA regulations. With the Pistons' injury woes this season, he has burned through a significant part of that time.
But if Jackson wants to leave to join a title contender, the Pistons would likely oblige.
The deadline for a waived player to retain playoff eligibility is March 1.
Youth movement is here Big man Christian Wood, 24, is playing well.
He is averaging 16.4 points and 7.9 rebounds and is shooting 52.3% from the field over his past 10 games. He's making 39.4% of 3-point attempts over that stretch.
Wood is one of nine players younger than 25 under team control who figure to see significant playing time over the last 25 games.
Rookie Sekou Doumbouya played well in the first eight starts of his career, but has struggled since.
But second-year guards Brown and Svi Mykhailiuk have established rotation spots.
Third-year guard Luke Kennard, who has missed 27 games with sore knees, should return at some point in the final portion of the season.
Khyri Thomas, who will make $1.6 million next season if he's on the roster past July 6, will return after missing significant time after foot surgery.

Texto completo: For nearly a decade, Lesley and D. Michael Risinger pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses, consulted firearms experts and argued in courtrooms, with help of a team of Seton Hall law students.
Their goal: Free two men they believed were wrongly convicted for a double murder in Camden a quarter-century ago.
That chance at freedom came Dec. 26, when a New Jersey appeals court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial for Kevin Baker and Sean Washington, who were found guilty of the killings and locked away in state prison in 1996.
For the husband-and-wife legal team who run the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, it was a hard-fought first victory after years of work to make the justice system face up to its own flaws.
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," said Lesley Risinger, who co-founded the program in 2011 and serves as director. "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
The Exoneration Project is driven by a key premise – that the criminal justice system makes mistakes and may send people to prison for crimes they did not commit. An estimated 1% to 5% of those in prison have been wrongfully convicted, according to a report last year ordered by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.
Assuming a 1% rate of wrongful conviction in New Jersey, nearly 200 of those currently in a state prison population of about 19,500 people are innocent. Yet there have been only 37 overturned convictions in the state since 1989, the report said.
'Total failure of the defense' Lesley Risinger first got involved in cases of the wrongfully accused nearly 30 years ago, when she helped her mother, an attorney, appeal the conviction of Luis Kevin Rojas of Weehawken. Rojas, 18 at the time of the alleged crime, had been found guilty of a fatal shooting in 1990, but the case was marred by mistaken identity and missing eyewitness testimony, his attorneys successfully argued. He was freed after a retrial in 1998.
Risinger later represented Fernando Bermudez, who was convicted in a 1991 Manhattan murder, but the case was based on perjured testimony, Risinger argued. In 2009, a judge freed Bermudez after 18 years in prison.
In 2011, the Risingers launched the Last Resort Exoneration Project and got many letters from prisoners claiming innocence and looking for help. With help from law students, they vet cases for evidence that could prove a conviction was improper.
The application from Kevin Baker, one of the two convicts in the Camden case, was compelling.
"It cried out for attention simply based on the weakness of the evidence and the total failure of the defense to present a defense," said Lesley Risinger, 62, a former adjunct professor who graduated from the law school in 2003.
The case rested on testimony from a single witness who was high on crack at the time of the shooting and whose story was so shaky that defense lawyers thought it wouldn't be believed, Risinger said. The state called six witnesses during the two-day trial, while the defense called none, court records show.
The proceedings ended in a guilty verdict and life sentences with no chance of parole for 60 years. John Wynne, an assistant Camden County prosecutor on the case, told The New York Times in 1996 that even he was surprised by the verdict.
"We had to do the investigation that should have been done then," said D. Michael Risinger, 72, the associate director of the Exoneration Project.
Last month, a state appeals court finally agreed, ordering a new trial. The court ruled that additional evidence not presented at the time "probably would have changed the jury's verdict." Jurors never heard a recording of Baker's 911 call or a forensics analysis showing that the shooting could not have happened as the witness described, the court found.
The Camden County Prosecutor's Office has decided not to seek a new trial for Baker and Washington, who is represented by Lawrence Lustberg, an attorney with Gibbons P.C. in Newark.
The prosecutor's office said it had weighed "the totality of the circumstances, including the passage of time and the impact it would have on re-trying the defendants and proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt."
Attorneys for the men, who began their terms in 1996, expressed delight with the decision.
A passion for the work The Last Resort Exoneration Project is similar to "innocence projects" that rely on DNA to prove that individuals did not commit crimes of which they were accused.
But the Risingers have taken an even more difficult route, choosing cases that lack DNA evidence but where other facts show the defendants did not receive a fair trial. They said they closely review applications to see where there's a strong legal case to prove innocence.
The Baker case is the Exoneration Project's first overturned conviction and required extensive litigation, expert analysis and hundreds of legal exhibits. The Risingers said they have also given close consideration to at least a dozen more cases.
About half a dozen law school students volunteer with the program each year. Over nine years, about a dozen worked on the Camden case, studying case files, reviewing trial documents and giving feedback on oral arguments.
They include Renee Mariotti, a part-time law student from New York City who chose Seton Hall Law in part for the chance to work at the Exoneration Project. Her interest came after listening to podcasts about wrongful convictions, in particular the Baltimore murder case of Adnan Syed made famous in the podcast "Serial."
"These are men who have been imprisoned for, coming up on 25 years, crimes they did not commit," Mariotti said of Baker and Washington. "It's nice to see the law working in what feels like the right way in this case. That's not always the outcome."
Amy Cuzzolino, a Bloomfield native who graduated in 2016, helped review applications to find viable legal cases. Her work gave her more insight into how the justice system works – and fails, she said.
"I didn't come away with a sense that the system is bad because of bad actors in it. It's more a question of inefficiency and limited resources. There are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but don't know how," said Cuzzolino, who is studying for an advanced degree in international law.
The Risingers, who live in Kearny, don't take a salary for their work. Private donations to the program pay for expenses like buying transcripts and consulting experts.
Michael Risinger, who worked on civil rights cases involving wrongful police shootings in the '1970s and '80s, said he has devoted his career to making sure the legal system is accurate, especially in criminal cases. The former Seton Hall law professor served on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Evidence for 25 years.
He and his wife, who married in 2004 and have six children from previous marriages, see their work with the Exoneration Project as a calling, he said.
"We have sufficient money. We live very frugally, and we don't have ambitions to take grand tours or anything," he said. "We'd rather do this."
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," says Lesley Risinger, director of the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark. She co-founded the program in 2011.

Texto completo: CAIRO - Somewhere in Egypt, around lunchtime Tuesday, the country reached a major milestone: Its 100 millionth citizen was born.
The birth of that citizen - whom officials identified as a girl named Yasmine Rabie, in a village in Minya governorate - was noted in Cairo by a giant counter outside the country's national statistics agency that has been ticking upward for years.
Hitting 100,000,000 marked human plenty, certainly, but also an uneasy moment in a country gripped by worries that its exploding population will exacerbate poverty and unemployment, and contribute to the scarcity of basic resources like land and water.
Egypt's Cabinet said last week that it was on "high alert" to fight population growth, which President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has described as a threat to national security on par with terrorism. If unchecked, the population could reach 128 million by 2030, officials say.
El-Sissi tried to push back the tide with a public health campaign called "Two Is Enough" to persuade parents to have fewer children. Like many such efforts, it failed.
Fertility rates have risen since 2008, to 3.5 children per woman, according to the United Nations, and the population is growing 1.8% annually - a rate that, in Egypt's crowded cities and towns, adds 1 million citizens every six months.
"The kids are coming thick and fast," said David Sims, a lecturer at the American University in Cairo and author of "Understanding Cairo: The Logic of a City Out of Control." "What the hell are they going to do?"
Egypt's population crisis is amplified by its unforgiving geography: 95% of the population lives on about 4% of the land, a green belt roughly half the size of Ireland that follows the Nile as it snakes through the desert then fans out into the lush Nile Delta.
The construction of a huge new dam on the Nile in Ethiopia, due to start filling this summer, has focused the public's fears about the existing strains on the river, largely from population growth.
Fertility rates are highest in rural areas, where a large family is considered a blessing. But their effect is felt most keenly in greater Cairo, where a sprawling megalopolis of about 20 million inhabitants is spilling into the surrounding desert and farmland.
Seen from roof height, the city looms as a vista of flat concrete roofs dotted with millions of satellite dishes. Even at the pyramids of Giza, houses, hotels and golf courses push in from three sides, leaving tourists with just one direction for photographs with a sand-filled backdrop.
On a recent night, Ahmed Abdel-Hadi, a taxi driver for the past 22 years, threaded his battered sedan through a river of traffic in Nasr City, a middle-class neighborhood. A cacophony of blaring horns filled the air. An ambulance inched past, its lights flashing.
Fistfights between irate drivers have been growing more frequent as traffic has worsened, Abdel-Hadi noted - a problem that peaks during the holy season of Ramadan, when Egyptians rush to break their fast at sunset.
But Abdel-Hadi is also part of the problem. A father of four children, ages 10 to 19, he scoffed at the mention of government campaigns urging him to restrict his family.
"Human capital is valuable," he declared. "A man's family is a reflection of his income, and that's what should determine how many children I have, not someone trying to dictate to me."
Suzanne Mubarak, wife of former President Hosni Mubarak, spearheaded a push during her husband's rule to reduce fertility rates. It was partly successful: During the 1990s and 2000s, rates fell to 3.0 from 5.2, according to government figures.
But the rate rose again around the time of the Arab Spring in 2011, for reasons that are not entirely clear, but probably stem from economic disruption, government turmoil and a drop in birth control funding from Western governments.
Under el-Sissi, the government has dispatched thousands of family planning advocates into rural areas and offered cheap contraceptives - as little as 6 cents for a packet of three condoms in a government store and 12 cents for an intrauterine device.
The country's leading Islamic authority, Al Azhar, has endorsed the government plans and stressed that family planning is not forbidden by God.
But critics say the government mostly talks a good game on population control and that its actions have not matched its slogans. El-Sissi's wife has not been a visible force on family planning, while his officials have tried to dent the problem with public health programs.
"Overpopulation is eating everything," said Dr. Amr A. Nadim, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Ain Ain Shams University. "But I don't feel the government is working all that hard on it."
He listed the issues: an erratic supply of contraceptives of variable quality; poor medical training; U.S. government funding that dried up; and no longer obliging new doctors to take family planning courses.
The population crush also affects him personally. "Sometimes I'm called to a pregnant woman in an emergency, but I can't reach her because of the traffic," he said.
"The problem," he added, "is that we don't have a real strategy to combat it."
Other large developing countries with soaring populations have managed to get the problem under control. Vietnam, where the population grew to 97 million in 2018 from 60 million in 1986, has reduced the rate of increase to 1%. Bangladesh, which has a population of more than 160 million, has done the same.
In Egypt, though, the rate of growth is nearly twice as high, at 1.79% in 2018-19. More than 700,000 young Egyptians enter the job market every year, said Aleksandar Bodiroza, representative of the United Nations Population Fund in Egypt. "That's a daunting task for any government," he said.
Housing them is equally challenging. El-Sissi has made much of the array of high-profile megaprojects his government is building, like a new summer capital on the north coast and a new administrative capital outside Cairo. But few Egyptians can afford to live in the fancy new developments.
Rather, most people are cramming into the informal settlements that are continually sprouting on the edge of Cairo and other cities, where villages are being transformed into dormitory towns and farmland is being swallowed by uncontrolled development.
Experts say the government has a dismal record in providing new housing for the poor. And the poverty rate is rising, hitting 32.5% last summer by the government's own figures - up from 27.8% in 2015. The stubbornly high fertility rate may be a reflection of that economic failure, said Sims, the author. "Egypt is heading back to its rural roots," he added. "If you're a poor person, you'll have more kids."The population milestone passed Tuesday was met with a shrug by many Egyptians, for whom the difficulties of life in a congested city that is bursting at the seams are nothing new.
Ahmed Alaa, 24, a marketing agent, said his desire to avoid congestion often shaped his days, and often that means simply staying home "It's become so normalized, this congestion," he said. "You can't set an appointment to do anything. The traffic is just so crazy."

Texto completo: RUMSON – The Lauriston mansion rose from a plot of land on Rumson Road during an era where the wealthy elite built massive estates as summer homes with regal-sounding names.
And that is exactly what the Lauriston is. One-time borough councilman Henry Caesar built the sprawling home on 91 Rumson Road in 1904, according to public records. His wife and the estate's namesake, Laura Caesar, was the mastermind behind the property's magnificent gardens, which exist now only in photographs.
The Lauriston itself could, too, become part of history, a fear that is galvanizing residents in hopes to save the century-old home from a plan that would replace the 10,635-square-foot, 12-bedroom mansion with six new structures resembling carriage houses that together would contain up to 16 luxury town houses priced at $1 million each.
The plan faces opposition from residents who want to see the mansion preserved. They also question how million-dollar town houses came to be an integral component of the borough's new affordable housing plan.
"This house is historic and we need to preserve it," said Katie Johnson, one of the residents behind a Facebook page and an associated petition to save the Lauriston.
Some residents are considering their options, looking to hire lawyers, potentially buy the property themselves and planning to head to a March 12 court date when a Monmouth County judge is set to approve the affordable housing plan.
Mumford, who was critical to saving the Red Bank home of early civil rights pioneer T. Thomas Fortune, said he considered all of the options residents have suggested, including saving the Lauriston's exterior while turning the interior into multiple units.
But doing so was not economically feasible, he said. The layout of the home did not lend itself to being divided into separate homes. Moreover, its condition is far worse than real estate pictures available online would lead the public to believe, he said.
Mumford estimated that it would cost "millions" to restore the home to its historic condition. Even then, today's home buyers aren't interested in the costs — from the five-figure tax bills to the staffing needed for upkeep — associated with massive mansions sprawling over multiple acres.
The Lauriston, for example, has an assessed value of about $3.1 million in 2019 with a tax bill just over $45,500.
The home at 132 Bingham Avenue, a mansion built in 2007 that would also be torn down for the town home project, was assessed at $5.9 million last year with a tax bill of $86,600. It's been on and off the real estate market since 2010.
"The gilded age is over," Mumford said. "People want to drive past and look at these big estates, but no one wants to buy them anymore."
The Lauriston mansion, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2002, was designed by local architect Leon Cubberley, whose work was built across Monmouth County and in New York.
Cubberley assisted with the design and construction of the Guaranty Trust Building and the New York Times Building in New York City and supervised https://rogermumfordhomes.com/construction of the Bordentown Reformatory and five buildings at Marlboro Hospital, according to his 1968 obituary in the Red Bank Register.
The home was slated to be demolished in the early 1970s when Mary and Sam Weir, who were renowned for flipping homes before the term became popularized by home improvement television shows.
They "recycled" the Lauriston, which they referred to as their "White House." It had 35 rooms, including 12 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms.
Their son, Christopher Weir, said his earliest memories were in the Lauriston. The home's entry featured a curved double staircase that split to two additional staircases.
"I used to slide down the banister," Christopher Weir said. "It was fun."
Christopher Weir remembers playing football in the home's ballroom and riding in its elevator. He also recalls the fanfare the home received from local television shows and the New York Times once his parents completed the renovations, which included building a new kitchen in former servants' quarters and insulating the home, which was initially built as a summer home and had no heating
The proposal for the Lauriston is couched in a much larger debate about affordable housing across New Jersey that dates to the 1975 Mount Laurel case where the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state's poorest residents have a right to affordable housing opportunities and that towns must allow a reasonable level of development.
But the agency that oversaw municipal affordable housing requirements was dismantled under the administration of former Gov. Chris Christie. The New Jersey Supreme Court intervened in 2015 and assigned the duty of overseeing towns' affordable housing requirements to the lower courts.
Since then, towns across the state have been reaching settlement agreements with the nonprofit Fair Share Housing Center to determine how much affordable housing they are required to provide.
And that's how Rumson borough leaders found themselves in mid-January, addressing a packed crowd in Forrestdale School gymnasium to outline and approve the terms of its settlement.
The plan addresses the vast majority of Rumson's affordable housing obligations with overlay zoning on certain parts of the borough like its downtown district and religious institutions. The overlay zoning would mean the properties would stay the same but would be open to more dense redevelopment projects that include affordable housing in the future should they stop being used as they are now.
But what riled residents was the part of the agreement with Yellow Brook Property Co. LLC, a subsidiary of Red Bank-based Roger Mumford Homes, that would allow the development company to build 34 luxury town homes at 91 Rumson Road and 132 Bingham Ave.
The project itself would not include affordable housing. Instead, Roger Mumford Homes will give a $1.7 million parcel it owns on Carton Street to the borough as well as $1.45 million to the borough's affordable housing trust fund.
The borough plans to use that money by working with a nonprofit group to build 14 affordable housing units on the property.
Residents balked at the notion that luxury homes — not affordable housing — would be built on the Rumson Road and Bingham Avenue parcels under the guise of an affordable housing settlement.
Mumford said he had initially proposed setting aside 20 percent of the project for affordable housing, but officials decided through the settlement negotiations to shift the affordable housing off site to lessen the density.
The town house plan was designed to look like larger homes in an effort to better match the surrounding neighborhood, he said.
Yet, neighbors want Mumford to do more to save the Lauriston. Johnson suggested Mumford could have kept the Lauriston's exterior and still turned it into a series of town homes.
The issue, Johnson said, is bigger than just the Lauriston.
"There are a lot of historic homes in Rumson and we would hate to see them all sort of go away," he said.
Mumford said he considered adapting the Lauriston, but said the home is deteriorating and the cost to refurbish and adapt the home into separate units is not economically feasible.
He, too, said the issue of large estate also goes beyond the Lauriston.
The luxury home market softened in 2019, with a 4.4 percent decline in sales over $1 million, according to data from Resources Real Estate, a Monmouth County luxury real estate firm that publishes The Resource Report, a quarterly recap of sales in the county.
Some attribute the dip to changes in federal tax law that lessened the mortgage deduction, impacting high-tax states like New Jersey, said Tom McCormack, a senior partner with Resources Real Estate.
Inventory may also play a role, he said. New Jersey has seen decreasing inventory for homes above $1 million over the past three years. There's now just over two months of inventory of luxury homes on the market, McCormack said.
Yet, the Lauriston was on and off the market several times since at least 2014. The property at 132 Bingham Ave. has been on and off the market since 2010.
Mumford said that mirrors something he has also been hearing from potential buyers who want to move to Rumson and want to buy luxury homes, but don't want the added burdens that can come with maintaining a sprawling estate.
His buyers want high-end homes, but they also want them to be efficient with all of the new amenities that come in new construction, Mumford said.
Peter S. Reinhart, director of the Kislak Real Estate Institute at Monmouth University, agreed that the demand for large estates is much smaller than it once was. He attributed the change to a demographic shift.
Baby boomers, while they were still in their 30s and 40s, would have loved to buy the large estates if they were able to afford them, Reinhart said. They didn't mind a long commute if it meant living in an well-appointed home in a nice neighborhood.
Those same buyers, as they hit their retirement years, are now looking to downsize to smaller homes.
Meanwhile, Gen X and millennial home buyers, now hitting their 30s and 40s, want a different type of home entirely. They want to live close to work or at least close to mass transit that brings them to work.
"Most of them can't possibly afford homes like this. But the even if they could, they wouldn't want them," Reinhart he said.

Texto completo: ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. - A one-armed Union general marched into eastern North Carolina in 1863 with his African Brigade, burning homes and freeing thousands of slaves.
The campaign stopped Confederate guerrilla resistance in the region.
This summer, the state plans to place a marker on Water Street in Elizabeth City, commemorating that first major campaign in North Carolina by U.S. Colored Troops.
Elizabeth City and Camden County were among the first areas where Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves was enforced, said Chris Meekins, an archivist for the State Archives of North Carolina.
"Elizabeth City was a microcosm of the overall war," said Meekins, who has written a book about Civil War actions in northeastern North Carolina.
Gen. Edward A. Wild, an avid abolitionist, led about 2,000 black soldiers as part of the U.S. Colored Troops in December 1863 with a mission to free slaves and quash Confederate guerrilla resistance. The force was known as Wild's African Brigade. Wild had lost an arm in an earlier Civil War conflict.
Many of the soldiers under Wild's command had been slaves in the region and were motivated to free their own family members, according to a history associated with the marker.
"It must have been overwhelming," said Wanda McLean, an Elizabeth City historian who has researched the Underground Railroad efforts in the region.
There are no known accounts from former slaves at the time in the region, but local African Americans celebrated Emancipation Day in Elizabeth City for about 30 years afterward with a parade, Meekins said. They would read Lincoln's proclamation on the courthouse steps.
"They really valued and understood what it was," Meekins said.
The marker placed on a metal post gives a brief account:
"Wild's Raid: First major campaign in N.C. conducted by the U.S. Colored Troops, Dec. 1863. Freed thousands of enslaved in the area."
North Carolina has erected about 1,600 signs along roadsides statewide since 1935 to mark historic places, events and people.
In three weeks, Wild's troops freed 2,500 slaves, burned a dozen homes of guerrillas, confiscated livestock and supplies from farms, took women as hostages and hanged a local fighter.
Wild's raid came about a year before Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's destructive march from Atlanta to Savannah.
Wild was hated here as much as Sherman was later in Georgia, said Camden County historian Alex Leary.
"They really didn't like him," he said.
Resentment burned for generations, and accounts of the Yankee invasion still stir emotions. Locals have ancestors who fought with the guerrillas or owned farms raided at the time, Leary said.
Leary taught high school history and often speaks on the Civil War. He has a collection of artifacts, including weapons and uniforms, of the era. He knows the site of a guerrilla camp within a swamp in southern Camden County.
Wild's black troops found the camp, scattered the guerrillas and confiscated guns and supplies left behind. They found a muster list with names of local fighters. After learning their identity, the troops burned many of their homes, Leary said.
Union troops had taken Elizabeth City in 1862 more than a year before Wild's African Brigade came, but the forces eventually left for other missions. Elizabeth City was left without military or local leadership.
"The city was lawless," Meekins said.
A reporter from the New York Times traveling with Wild described the city.
"Now most of the dwellings were deserted, the stores all closed, the streets overgrown with grass," wrote the reporter known only as Tewksbury.
The U.S. Colored Troops and the guerillas never engaged in battle and no casualties were listed, Meekins said. Local soldiers fired a few shots before retreating into the swamps when confronted by the more numerous black troops.
A guerrilla from Pasquotank County named Daniel Bright was captured and sentenced to death.
"He was a man of about 30, a rough, stout fellow, was dressed in butternut homespun, and looked the very ideal of a guerrilla," Tewksbury wrote.
Bright stood on top of an empty cider barrel with a noose around his neck when the soldiers removed the support. Bright was left there dangling as a warning, Tewksbury wrote.
When the campaign ended, dozens of local leaders signed petitions promising loyalty to the Union. Slaves would be free and guerrilla activity would stop.
"The war came to northeastern North Carolina, and it just didn't leave," Meekins said. "This thing had slogged on for years. After this raid, they were done."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is escalating his campaign against government officials who frustrate him when they act on the basis of facts and professional judgment.
More and more, people who know how things work in the White House and federal agencies are calling out Trump for reaching down the pecking order to exert self-serving influence.
By showing the merest anti-tyrannical instinct, his mildest critics can enhance their public reputations among their peers.
Even Attorney General William Barr saw fit to proclaim last Thursday that the president's tweets targeting his department "make it impossible for me to do my job."
The previous day, former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who also was loyal to a fault, won a good reception at a lecture in New Jersey in which he countered his ex-boss's denunciations of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.
Kelly said that when Vindman sounded internal alarms about the impropriety of Trump's famous "do us a favor" phone call to Ukraine's president, he "did exactly what we teach them to do."
The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, meanwhile, received a standing ovation at Georgetown University, where she accepted the prestigious Trainor Award for excellence in diplomacy.
"The State Department is in trouble," she said in her first public remarks since testifying in the House impeachment inquiry. "We need to re-empower our diplomats to do their job. We can't be afraid to share our expertise or challenge false assumptions."
These restrained public criticisms by Kelly and Yovanovitch resonate among those who take seriously the institutions they serve, or have served.
Also last Wednesday came an unusual public protest by four prosecutors who were overruled by their own Justice Department in requesting a tough sentence for Trump crony Roger Stone, who was convicted of witness tampering and obstructing Congress.
Trump "commandeered the sentencing in a politically sensitive criminal matter, reversing the position uniformly accepted and promoted by the career prosecutors," David Laufman, a former Justice Department official, told The New York Times.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, presiding over the Stone case, is quite likely to come away from Trump's nasty verbal taunts with her legal reputation improved and her integrity intact.
The dynamic goes beyond the courts and the foreign service.
An exodus of veteran staffers commenced at the Environmental Protection Agency shortly after Trump's term began. 
For political reasons, Trump aides tried and failed to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census. Experts who advise the U.S. Census Bureau, from economists to demographers and engineers, opposed the move on operational grounds.
U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was forced to quit after trying to battle White House meddling in a disciplinary case involving a war atrocity. Spencer isn't in disgrace. He's been campaigning for candidate Mike Bloomberg.
Trump's preference for whim-based government extends to weather forecasts. Last fall, bureaucrats at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were pressured to waste their time propping up his false insistence on a hurricane threat to Alabama.
The reputations of those who stuck to reality remains intact. The silli

Texto completo: Opal Staudenmaier, 48, of Gorham is stuck in Phnom Penh after another passenger from her cruise ship tested positive for the disease.
Cruise passenger stuck in Cambodia after shipmate tests positive
A Gorham woman is stranded in Cambodia after another passenger who disembarked from her cruise ship tested positive for the new coronavirus that has sickened tens of thousands in China and others elsewhere around the world.
It’s the latest twist in the odyssey of Opal Staudenmaier, who embarked on a Pacific cruise in January and, as the outbreak swept through Asia, found her ship, the MS Westerdam, barred from port after port. Manila, Kaoshiung, Taiwan, and Ishigaki, Japan, all turned the 951-foot Dutch cruise liner away, fearing infection from passengers who boarded in Hong Kong.
The cruise was eventually canceled on Feb. 7, but the ordeal is far from over.
After finally being allowed to disembark this past Thursday in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, passengers of the Westerdam were informed this weekend that they couldn’t fly home after all.
An 82-year-old American woman from the ship had tested positive for the coronavirus, twice, after flying with more than a hundred other passengers to Malaysia, The New York Times reported.
As a result, Staudenmaier and many other passengers have been confined to their rooms at a hotel in Phnom Penh, the country’s capital, as they endure round after round of tests.
“This is a lot less tolerable than being ‘stranded’ on a luxury cruise ship,” Staudenmaier, a 48-year-old software developer at Idexx Laboratories, wrote in an email Saturday.
“Coronavirus” is the name of a family of diseases that typically affect the respiratory system. The latest outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has spread to 68,500 people in mainland China and others across the globe. The death toll in China reached 1,665 on Sunday.
Cambodian officials have tested all passengers and crew members who had fever or flu-like symptoms since leaving Hong Kong on Feb. 1., Staudenmaier said. Staudenmaier herself had caught a cold recently, but said she had tested negative for the coronavirus.
The Westerdam initially received a warm welcome in Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Sen greeted disembarking passengers in person last week, and the cruise line, Holland America, was able to charter flights to get passengers home.
Staudenmaier’s homebound flight had been scheduled for Saturday. She and other passengers took a charter flight from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh, which is more than 100 miles inland, without trouble.
But when they arrived in the capital, she said, “we were greeted with chaos.”
Check-ins dragged on, and little information was available about when the flight would actually depart. Then came the announcement of a positive coronavirus test, accompanied by news that the flight was delayed — and then canceled. Other flights chartered by Holland America were not allowed to land.
Cruise line officials distributed letters to passengers in Phnom Penh on Sunday informing them that travel plans were, for now, up in the air.
“It will be impossible for us to plan any travel arrangement from Phnom Penh today for you to complete your homeward journey,” said a copy of the letter provided by Staudenmaier.
Phnom Penh is 12 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast, and tests were scheduled to begin again on Monday morning, Cambodia time.

Texto completo: Digging yourself out is as much about changing your thinking as it is about redirecting your money.
Credit card debt can feel like laundry. Normally you toss a load into the washing machine when your hamper gets full. But sometimes -- after, say, a particularly busy month -- your entire wardrobe is piled on the floor and you avert your eyes whenever you walk by the clothing mountain to avoid pangs of self-loathing.
Debt often works the same way. You spend a little too much here, endure a hiccup there, and pretty soon you have a heap of borrowed money you can't even remember how you spent. You might even be making some mistakes that you're not aware of. These mind tricks will help you dig yourself out.
Editorial note: The assessments of financial products in this article are independently determined by Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any third party.
Tackle the easy stuff first
When confronted with a haul of debt, your first step should be to stop making the job harder.
One study, published in the American Economic Review, found that many of the borrowers they followed could have avoided most of the credit card interest and overdraft and late fees by moving debt from high-interest cards to low-interest cards, repaying their balance with money they had in their checking accounts or using a different credit card that had a big enough credit limit.
You could try "snowballing," which is personal finance guru Dave Ramsey's preferred method. The way it works is you first pay off the card with the lowest balance and then move to the next lowest, regardless of what interest rate is charged. This plan allows you to build up positive momentum and bonhomie as you work through your debt.
Another option is to devote your attention to the card with the highest interest rate, and pay that one off first. This tends to be what math-minded folks prefer because they end up paying the least amount of interest. Applying for a balance transfer card, which comes with a long period of zero percent interest, will give you extra time to retire the debt.

If you have debt on two cards, you'll be more inclined to pay a fixed percentage (say, 30 percent) of both cards, one study from the University of Chicago Becker Friedman Institute Working Paper series found. Don't do this. You'll take longer to pay off your debt, and end up owing more in interest in the process.
Raise your credit limit (gulp!)
If you're the kind of person who takes it as a point of pride never to fall behind on credit card bills, you may be more susceptible to bad behavior when things do get a little out of control, according to a study in the Journal of Marketing Research.
Let's say there's one especially expensive month when the refrigerator goes bust, you have to fly to your cousin's destination wedding in Alaska and the dog gets sick. You look at your statement, then at your bank account and realize you just can't swing it. Pretty soon you start buying stuff left-and-right, no matter the consequences. After all, you're not a "responsible borrower" anymore, so you might as well have a little fun.
You're not alone. That same study found that carrying "a credit card balance tends to increase spending for people with relatively high self-control." Once a self-controlled spender fails to live up to their goals they feel, well, like a failure.
And with that failure comes permission to spend more and buy higher-priced items than you normally would. It's known, according to Keith Wilcox, a professor of marketing at Columbia University's business school and one of the paper's authors, as the "what the hell effect."
"The more you beat yourself up, the more likely overspending is to occur," Professor Wilcox said.
The paper found you can soften your despair if you make that misstep feel less bad. For instance, increasing your credit limit makes a revolving debt look smaller, and makes you feel better. Owing $ 500 with a $ 5,000 limit is easier to swallow than if you had a limit of only $ 1,000. And by avoiding, or lessening, bouts of these blues you're less likely to say "to hell with it" and double your debt by buying that Madewell leather jacket.
Consider asking your card issuer to increase your limit, although you might incur a small and temporary credit score ding. A 2019 CompareCards.com survey found that about four out of five people who requested that their bank increase their credit limit were successful. And if you ask to have your interest rate reduced, you'll have a good shot, too.
Finally, truly consider if that increase will send you further over the edge. If you think it will, this method is not for you.
Marie Kondo your spending
In a cruel twist, you're at risk of overspending in good times, too. A separate paper co-written by Professor Wilcox found that when some people enjoyed a self-esteem boost from using social media, they were more likely to fall into credit card debt. Another paper, by Professors Dennis Zhang and Tat Chan of the Washington University in St. Louis, and Prof. Zhenling Jiang of Georgia State University that was published on S.S.R.N., an open-access site for academic research, found that demands for auto loans skyrocketed after people received a one-time bonus -- as did delinquencies. We often run into trouble when events conspire in our favor. (The credit rating agency Equifax supported the research and provided the data, although the paper's views are the authors' only.)
To counteract this effect, consider going on an elimination diet for your wallet. Stick to buying only what you need for sustenance for a month, and then slowly reintroduce certain items (like movie tickets or new clothes) and see if they bring you joy.
A benefit is that you'll save some money, which you can use to pay down the debt you previously amassed.
That tingle of excitement in your stomach? That's joy, and you'll feel it every time you think about your stripped-down wallet to complement your tidied-up closet.

Texto completo: More than 1,100 former prosecutors and officials who served in Republican and Democratic administrations signed an open letter condemning the president and the attorney general over the Stone case.
WASHINGTON -- More than 1,100 former federal prosecutors and Justice Department officials called on Attorney General William P. Barr on Sunday to step down after he intervened last week to lower the Justice Department's sentencing recommendation for President Trump's longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr.
They also urged current government employees to report any signs of unethical behavior at the Justice Department to the agency's inspector general and to Congress.
"Each of us strongly condemns President Trump's and Attorney General Barr's interference in the fair administration of justice," the former Justice Department lawyers, who came from across the political spectrum, wrote in an open letter on Sunday. Those actions, they said, "require Mr. Barr to resign."
The sharp denunciation of Mr. Barr underlined the extent of the fallout over the case of Mr. Stone, capping a week that strained the attorney general's relationship with his rank and file, and with the president himself.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
After prosecutors on Monday recommended a prison sentence of up to nine years for Mr. Stone, who was convicted of obstructing a congressional inquiry, Mr. Trump lashed out at federal law enforcement. Senior officials at the department, including Mr. Barr, overrode the recommendation the next day with a more lenient one, immediately prompting accusations of political interference, and the four lawyers on the Stone case abruptly withdrew in protest.
The Justice Department said the case had not been discussed with anyone at the White House, but that Mr. Trump congratulated Mr. Barr on his decision did little to dispel the perception of political influence. And as the president widened his attacks on law enforcement, Mr. Barr publicly reproached the president, saying that Mr. Trump's statements undermined him, as well the department.
"I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me," Mr. Barr said during a televised interview on Thursday with ABC News.
In the days after the interview, Mr. Trump has been relatively muted. He said on Twitter that he had not asked Mr. Barr to "do anything in a criminal case." As president, he added, he had "the legal right to do so" but had "so far chosen not to!"
But lawyers across the Justice Department continue to worry about political interference from the president despite public pushback by Mr. Barr, long considered a close ally of Mr. Trump's.
The letter's signatories included Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under President George Bush, and about 50 former U.S. attorneys. Protect Democracy, a nonprofit legal group, gathered the signatures from Justice Department alumni and said it would collect more.
In May, Protect Democracy gathered signatures for a letter that said the Mueller report presented enough evidence to charge Mr. Trump with obstruction of justice were that an option. At the close of his investigation, the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declined to indicate whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice, citing a decades-old department opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. That letter was also critical of Mr. Barr.
Even as the lawyers condemned Mr. Barr on Sunday, they said they welcomed his rebuke of Mr. Trump and his assertions that law enforcement must be independent of politics.
But Mr. Barr's "actions in doing the president's personal bidding unfortunately speak louder than his words," they said.
The letter comes days after some Democratic senators pressed for Mr. Barr to resign, and after the New York City Bar Association said that it had formally reported the attorney general's behavior to the Justice Department's inspector general.
Strikingly, the lawyers called upon current department employees to be on the lookout for future abuses and to be willing to bring oversight to the department.
"Be prepared to report future abuses to the inspector general, the Office of Professional Responsibility, and Congress," they wrote, and "to refuse to carry out directives that are inconsistent with their oaths of office."
Prosecutors who currently work at the department should withdraw from cases that involve abuses or political interference, the lawyers said.
As a last resort, they asked Justice Department employees "to resign and report publicly -- in a manner consistent with professional ethics -- to the American people the reasons for their resignation."

Texto completo: The movie's creators redesigned its title character after an early trailer was ridiculed. That may have helped it avoid disaster.
"Sonic the Hedgehog" shot to the top of the box office this weekend, opening to an estimated $ 57 million in domestic ticket sales -- a somewhat unlikely success story for the film, an adaptation of a video game series about a little blue creature with a superhuman sprint.
The movie could easily have been a box-office disaster. Domestic moviegoers haven't always been particularly kind to adaptations of video games; "Warcraft" and "Assassin's Creed," from 2016, and the more recent "Tomb Raider" reboot, all struggled at the box office. And the creators of "Sonic the Hedgehog" redesigned its digital title character, delaying the movie's release, after audiences ridiculed an early trailer.
But "Sonic the Hedgehog," distributed by Paramount Pictures and based on the Sega video-game character, has more than avoided catastrophe. It brought in an additional estimated $ 43 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio, bringing its global opening-weekend total to $ 100 million. The movie's budget was reportedly $ 85 million.
Directed by Jeff Fowler, "Sonic the Hedgehog" pairs its blue, fur-covered hero (voiced by Ben Schwartz) with a human friend played by James Marsden, and pits them against a mustachioed villain played by Jim Carrey.
While it may not be the next "Parasite," "Sonic the Hedgehog" received a fairly warm response from critics, holding a 63 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Ticket-buyers seemed to embrace it, too, giving it an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. (Ben Kenigsberg, in his review for The New York Times, was less impressed. "Sonic now resembles a cartoon hedgehog instead of a spray-painted marmot," he wrote, referring to the character's digital makeover. "But if anything was done to de-genericize the script, it hasn't helped.")

Two lower-budget newcomers are in a close race for third place.
"Blumhouse's Fantasy Island," a horror movie distributed by Sony, opened to an estimated $ 12.4 million in domestic ticket sales this weekend, a good start for a movie whose reported budget was around $ 7 million. Estimates place it slightly ahead of Universal's "The Photograph," a New York-set romance with Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield that also had a good opening this weekend, with about $ 12.3 million in domestic sales from Friday through Sunday. (That film's reported budget was $ 16 million.) Either movie could land in third place when final counts are made on Monday.
Second place went to "Birds of Prey" (Warner Bros.), a DC Comics origin story with Margot Robbie that had a disappointing opening last weekend. It continued that course this weekend, bringing in an estimated $ 17.1 million in sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data.
But the weekend's biggest stumble was probably "Downhill" (Searchlight), a comedy with Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus that opened to an estimated (and meager) $ 4.7 million, landing in 10th place. The movie, a remake of the dark Swedish comedy "Force Majeure," had received weak reviews; its Rotten Tomatoes score is 40 percent.

Nedda Casei, 87, Singer Turned Union President

Texto completo: Ms. Casei was an energetic and exciting presence on the Met stage in the 1960s and '70s before becoming president of a performers' union.
Nedda Casei, who in the 1960s and '70s could be reliably heard as Suzuki, Maddalena, Lola and other bread-and-butter mezzo-soprano characters at the Metropolitan Opera before transforming herself into a pathbreaking labor leader, died on Jan. 20 in hospice care in Manhattan. She was 87.
A niece, Janice Arponen, said the cause was a stroke.
Ms. Casei sang in some 280 performances at the Met, from her debut as Maddalena in Verdi's "Rigoletto" in 1964 until her final curtain, in 1984, as Larina in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin."
She also sang "Carmen" there. In one performance, in 1978, as the understudy for Elena Obraztsova, she had to go on at the last minute.
After her first scene, "'Boo' rang out like a clap of thunder, full-throated, resonant and shocking," the critic Jack Hiemenz wrote in the newspaper The News World. "For a moment there was stunned silence, then the audience, outraged, shot back vehement applause and a few bravos." Mr. Hiemenz suggested that a plant in the audience might have emitted the "boo" to generate sympathy for Ms. Casei.
Then he gushed.
"She was simply splendid," he wrote. "It's been a long time since the Met gave us a sexually exciting Carmen, one who repels you and arouses you at the same time."
Other critics were not always so enthusiastic, although Ms. Casei often received positive notices. In The New York Times, Donal Henahan found her "overly cute" as Suzuki in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" in 1969, but four years later Raymond Ericson called her "vocally rich" as the character, Butterfly's maid.
Nedda Jane Casey was born on Sept. 9, 1932, in Baltimore to Howard T. Casey, a realtor and retired engineer, and Lyda (Graupman) Casey, a homemaker. Nedda changed her surname to Casei as a young performer in Italy, partly because that (kah-ZAY) was how Italians pronounced it, Mrs. Arponen said.
She grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., and studied voice privately. Her professional opera debut came in 1960, at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, and she went on to sing at numerous houses in Europe and across the United States, and at the White House for Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.
Ms. Casei married John A. Wiles Jr. in 1971; they were divorced in 1979. In 1983, she married Samuel Strasbourger, who died in 1987. A brother, Robert, died before her. Mrs. Arponen and two other nieces are her only survivors.
Ms. Casei's labor career started when she helped negotiate a contract for solo singers at the Met amid a bitter dispute with management that delayed the 1969-70 season. The performers received better pay and a reduction in the long hours they were required to be at the house.
Ms. Casei had just bought an apartment in the Dakota on Central Park West and had a mortgage to pay, so she decided to join the negotiating committee to seek better compensation, Mrs. Arponen said.
"She always took care of herself," she said. "When she saw a wrong, she wanted to right it."
In 1972 she joined the board of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing opera singers, chorus members, ballet dancers and other theater denizens.
She began studying at Fordham University in the waning years of her career and in 1982 received a bachelor's degree in performing arts management. Around that time she was asked to run for president of the union. "It was the perfect opportunity to put some of this new knowledge to work," she said in a statement as part of the guild's 70th-anniversary festivities.
She won, becoming the first woman to head the guild, which at the time had 5,800 members nationwide. Her signature achievement was to build up an emergency fund to help members in times of trouble. It amounted to about $ 1 million when she left office in 1993 (the equivalent of about $ 1.8 today).
"Nedda used her fame, her warm and generous personality, and powerful friendships to create an endowment which continues to provide a secure future for the Relief Fund," Linda Mays, a former guild president and current Relief Fund trustee, said in a statement.
In later years, Ms. Casei, while living in a richly decorated Sutton Place penthouse in Manhattan, judged voice competitions and taught singing, including for a time at Aichi Prefectural University in Nagoya, Japan.
By then she had retired from the stage, but she agreed to sing a recital there even if she was out of shape. That caused an attack of nerves, she said in an interview with the blog Classical Voice.
"Surprise! The instant I walked onstage the nerves were totally gone," she said. "I realized: 'These are your friends. These are people you want to sing for."'
It was the best she had ever sung, she said -- "and," she added, "that's the way I finished."

Are Smartphones Interesting Again?

Texto completo: Amazing as it may sound, phone makers are doing more than just adding fancy new cameras.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello, I'm Dai Wakabayashi, and I cover Google in San Francisco for The New York Times.
For the most part, writing about smartphones over the last few years has been pretty boring. Can you get that excited about a phone going from two cameras to three?
But this was an interesting week for smartphone news, illustrating both the promise of developments (pun alert) unfolding before us and the challenges of trying to do something new and different.
A few days after Motorola (supposedly) started selling its foldable Razr phone, Samsung showed off its latest attempt at a bendable smartphone. The early reviews of Samsung's Galaxy Flip Z seem cautiously optimistic, with some reporters praising the glass screen and the sturdy-seeming hinges. I am more excited for these phones than my colleague Brian X. Chen, who made the levelheaded argument that these handsets were probably not ready for prime time and seemed like more trouble than they were worth.
But I don't think I am alone in experiencing a little device wanderlust. That was part of the bet behind Essential Products, once considered one of the most promising hardware start-ups in Silicon Valley.
Essential Products was started by Andy Rubin, a former Google executive who had a successful track record in the smartphone industry. The company had raised $ 330 million. But Essential's first product, a premium smartphone, flopped. When The New York Times and others reported Mr. Rubin's departure from Google after an employee had accused him of sexual misconduct, it created even more challenges for the company.
This week, Essential said it was shutting down. The company said it saw "no clear path" to deliver its latest handset to customers. Essential was trying something different. It had developed a so-called companion phone named Project Gem, but carriers did not want to offer it, and the company decided to pull the plug.
I asked a former Essential employee whether they thought this was a sign of how hard it is to compete in the smartphone industry. This person, who asked not to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement with the company, called that analysis "lazy" and pinned more of the blame on dysfunction within the company.
The former employee said Essential had spent "a bunch of time and money" on a separate second smartphone called PH-2 (the first phone was called PH-1) to near completion only to scrap it when none of the carriers expressed an interest in it. This prompted an exodus of talented workers from the company.
The former employee said there were other red flags: There were more managers than engineers at Essential, and many quality assurance engineers, even though there was only one (poor-selling) product.
In addition, Mr. Rubin, who was supposed to be the driving force behind the products, seemed not fully engaged because he was busy dealing with his personal matters, the former employee said.
A spokeswoman for Essential did not respond to a request for comment.
Also, and I'll stand my ground on this: It's really hard to break into the smartphone market.
Stories you shouldn't miss:
The changes in the world of smartphones came against the backdrop of alarming world news: Fears about the coronavirus outbreak forced the cancellation of the telecom industry's annual gathering, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
The United States is putting more pressure on the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei. On Thursday, the Justice Department unveiled new charges against the company that invoked racketeering statutes usually used to bring down mob kingpins.
I loved this column by Kevin Roose about Carlos Maza, who has become one of YouTube's biggest critics for failing to crack down on right-wing creators who have targeted him for harassment. But the column also captures beautifully how creators like Mr. Maza rely on YouTube as a way to make a living even as its policies leave them exposed.
Welcome to elections in 2020. This wonderful article about how Michael R. Bloomberg is paying influencers to help him be meme-worthy and hip is a cringe-y delight.
Hindsight is 20/20. The Federal Trade Commission said this week that it had ordered Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft to provide information about hundreds of acquisitions over the last decade. These acquisitions did not require regulatory review because they were considered small. It does seem like regulators are now scrutinizing every nook and cranny of these companies.
Amazon still wants the big, government cloud-computing contract -- and is willing to fight for it. A federal court ordered Microsoft to stop working on a $ 10 billion Pentagon cloud-computing contract until Amazon's legal challenge into how the deal was awarded is resolved.
Amazon has protested the decision to award Microsoft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, claiming that President Trump had interfered with the bidding process because of his feud with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive.

Texto completo: The theatrical concert has been a critical and commercial success. A film version by Spike Lee is also on the way.
David Byrne ended the remarkably successful Broadway run of his "American Utopia" on Sunday with a surprise announcement: He will reprise the show for another 17 weeks next fall and winter.
"American Utopia," an energetic and tightly choreographed theatrical concert, has won acclaim from critics and audiences, and has proved to be a financial hit, consistently selling out the 961-seat Hudson Theater with tickets priced at as much as $ 649.
Spike Lee has announced that he would direct a filmed version of the show, to be released this year. Byrne is also scheduled to perform with the "American Utopia" musicians on "Saturday Night Live" on Feb. 29.
The return engagement, also at the Hudson Theater, is scheduled to run from Sept. 18 through Jan. 17. The theater will be occupied this spring and summer by a revival of "Plaza Suite," a Neil Simon comedy starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.
"American Utopia," initially the title of a Byrne album and performed in concert venues around the world, arrived on Broadway last October, and recouped its $ 4 million capitalization just 10 weeks after opening. Byrne, a 67-year-old pop star who became famous as the lead singer of the Talking Heads, generally performed 6 shows a week, for a total of 121 performances; the show includes songs from the recent album, as well as classic hits.
Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called the show a "cloud-sweeping upper." It is choreographed by Annie-B Parson. The Broadway run features the stage director Alex Timbers as a production consultant, and is produced by Kristin Caskey, Mike Isaacson, Patrick Catullo and Todomundo, which is Byrne's record label.
The Broadway run grossed a total of $ 18.8 million, and had been seen by 107,575 people, as of Feb. 9, according to the Broadway League. During the week that ended Feb. 9, the show's average ticket price was $ 211, second only to "Hamilton."

Texto completo: It's an agonizing, dangerous journey on overloaded trucks in freezing weather.1
Hundreds of thousands of people -- mostly women and children -- are trying to escape relentless airstrikes in northwest Syria. Families have been separated. Some crawl ahead by car. Others go on foot.
It is a migration similar in scale to the Rohingya crisis of 2017. But here in Idlib, where pro-government forces are fighting to recapture the rebels' last territory, many people are fleeing for the third or fourth time.2
During nine years of civil war, millions of Syrians found safety in other countries -- or in Idlib Province. Idlib was the refuge of last resort.
But now there is nowhere left to go.
Turkey has closed its border. And as pro-government forces march further into Idlib, civilians are squeezed into a shrinking space between the border and the war.
Abu Muhammad, a father of four and former government soldier who defected, fled with his family last year. He took only what he could fit on one small motorcycle -- some blankets and his 18-year-old daughter's English textbook. "We left with nothing," he said.3
His family has been uprooted multiple times during the war, moving farther and farther north. Now, as the fighting gets closer, he is preparing to flee again.
They are part of the exodus that started last year, after Syrian and Russian forces launched a new assault on rebel-held lands.
They hit hospitals, schools and bakeries. In many places, health care is out of reach. At least 1,700 civilians have been killed since the offensive began last spring.
The Syrian government and its allies have also hit people as they fled. A strike on one family's van last week killed nine civilians, including seven women and children.4
Some people have set their own houses on fire before leaving, determined not to let them fall into government hands. "Burn everything. I don't want to see" government forces inside, Abdul Rahman Abdo said as he burned his home.
The aim of the strikes, it appeared, was to clear people out. It worked.5
If Idlib falls, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will be close to recapturing the country's last opposition-held territory for the first time since 2012.
Many people fleeing end up in conditions like this: camping in flimsy tents that flood over and over again. Some have been living here for months. Other families are out in the open, without shelter.6
It's also bitterly cold, often below freezing. This tent burned down after a family lit a fire for warmth, killing two young sisters. At least 12 people have died of exposure.7
Abu Muhammad said he's using the blankets he brought to try to block the wind from the half-finished room where he's staying.
Satellite images show the massive expansion of camps and temporary housing around that area over the past year. If the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands more will flee.
Near the Turkish border, brick housing is finally going up to shelter a small portion of the displaced. But it's not enough.8
Europe, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan -- everyone wants the refugee crisis to go away, and for Syrians to return to Syria. But the country is so destroyed, its economy so ruined, that people may be living as refugees for years. Can Syrians ever go home?

Texto completo: Credit cards can build your credit and earn you rewards, but they can also put you in debt. These tricks can keep you accountable for your spending.
Fewer people than ever carry cash these days, it seems. Life can seem ultraconvenient when you don't have to worry about a wad of bills in your pocket (or even a wallet in your pocket, for that matter).
But it can hurt people with low incomes when businesses go cashless, it can hurt workers who rely on cash tips and -- even if you're not in either of these groups -- it can hurt you because it's easy to get into financial trouble with credit cards.
Studies prove that people spend more when using credit vs. cash, and late payments are on the rise.
"You have an out-of-sight, out-of-mind phenomenon with credit cards," said Amy Bucher, the director of behavior change design at Mad*Pow, a design consultancy group. "Unless they're checking their credit card balance on a daily basis, most people don't have an awareness of how much debt they're in."
But if used responsibly, credit cards are a fast way to build credit without paying a dime of interest. Good credit scores can save you money down the road, typically qualifying you for lower mortgage or auto loan interest rates. Credit card rewards can make things you buy a little cheaper.
The good news: Mental tricks, apps and tools can make spending with credit cards similar to cash, giving you the best of both worlds.

Make credit card purchases feel tactile
Cash requires you to shop at a physical store, grab your physical wallet and hand over physical money. Giving a cashier a $ 20 bill in exchange for an $ 18 item is a tangible transaction. In exchange for a $ 20, you now have $ 2 left and a physical bauble.
But a credit card looks the same before and after the transaction, obfuscating what was actually given up for that bauble. Add online shopping to the mix, and you might not even think about your credit card or where the money is coming from.
Grab a receipt. Beverly Harzog, a credit card expert and consumer finance analyst for U.S. News & World Report, always takes a receipt. "It's just one more thing to help you keep a grip on reality," she said. "When they ask if you want a receipt, just say yes so you have that feeling of payment in your hand."
Remove payment information from your computer. Consumer psychologists refer to creating friction -- meaning barriers to doing something -- as an effective way to stop an impulse buy. "If you're sitting on your couch, you've had two glasses of wine, you see rain boots on sale, and your credit card information auto-populates, you're probably going to buy it, because you really only needed to hit two buttons to make that purchase," Ms. Bucher said. "If you had to get off your couch, pull out your credit card and type in the numbers, that's friction. You have to commit a little more to make the purchase." In contrast, digital payments like Apple Pay offer convenience when you're at the cash register, but they take cash and physical cards out of the equation. If you're nervous that holding your phone next to the scanner to complete a transaction could turn you into a spendthrift, don't partake.

Set spending limits
You can't buy $ 300 headphones if your wallet contains only $ 100. But you can if you've got a card with a credit limit over $ 300 (even if $ 300 exceeds your budget).
Let robots count your money. Budgeting apps like You Need a Budget ( $ 84 a year) or Mint (no fee) track balances across all your accounts, giving you a clearer picture of your actual balance even if you have multiple cards and accounts from different banks. Some banks, such as Bank of America, also let you sync other accounts, even if those accounts are with competing banks. Check your balance in the app to ensure your next purchase fits your budget.
Try "action planning." Determine your budget, then implement measures that prevent you from exceeding it. The Uber Credit Card has a feature that lets you create a self-imposed spending limit for certain categories or merchants, which could remove the temptation to stop at Starbucks on the way to work. Other companies, like Discover, allow you to set up alerts if your credit card balance exceeds a certain amount or you near your credit limit.
Banish late fees
Whether your bill due date slipped your mind or you don't have the money on hand, blowing your due date can often mean a late payment fee of up to $ 39 and a penalty A.P.R. (an increase in your interest rate, typically triggered by late payments). You're unlikely to incur a late fee with cash. You can set up autopay (most major credit card companies offer it) to have payments automatically deducted from the savings or checking account of your choosing before your bill is due. Paying your full statement balance via autopay is a way to avoid late payments and interest on balances.
But you might also be anti-autopay, with good reason. If you don't have enough money when your bill is automatically paid, you could get hit with overdraft fees (typically around $ 35), and autopay might lead you to stop checking your statements, increasing the odds that you miss potentially incorrect charges, Ms. Harzog said. If that's you, there are still options.
Set up reminders. Whether it's an alert in your digital calendar or a handwritten note in your planner, create a reminder to check that your account has sufficient funds -- and then pay your bill. Some companies, such as Discover and Chase, can alert you via text or email you ahead of your due date, a feature Ms. Bucher uses. "I treat my inbox like a to-do list, so I don't delete the email until I've paid my bill in full," she said. "When I pay it off, it feels really good to delete the email."
Make bills part of your routine. Whether you opt to pay your bill when write your monthly rent check, or every Monday morning when you get into the office, build it into your schedule.
Still, credit cards are not for everyone, and even the best psychological tricks might not work for you. "No one should ever feel pressure to use a credit card," Ms. Harzog said. "If it's not something you're comfortable with, start by using debit so you get used to the structure of paying with a card, and move on to a credit card when you're ready. If you're never ready, it's O.K. to stick with cash, too."

Texto completo: Politicized by her child's death, she went on to counsel the first post-colonial leaders of Algeria, both Congos, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Ghana.
Since 1851, many remarkable black men and women did not receive obituaries in The New York Times. This month, with Overlooked, we're adding their stories to our archives.
As a mixed-race woman living in central Africa under European rule, Andrée Blouin had resigned herself to a life of daily humiliation. At age 17, she became, in her words, an "African concubine" -- first to a Belgian aristocrat, who made her hide in the kitchen when guests came over, and then to a French businessman, who called his black houseboy a "big chimpanzee."
But when the health of her 2-year-old son, René, was in jeopardy, she could no longer remain quiet. It was 1946, and Blouin was living in Bangui, the capital of the French colony of Ubangi-Shari. René had been hospitalized with malaria but was denied medication because he was one-quarter African. Blouin burst into the mayor's office to demand an exception. It was refused. "Child murderer!" she screamed as she was dragged out.
A month later, René was dead.
"The death of my son politicized me as nothing else could," Blouin recalled in her 1983 memoir, "My Country, Africa." Colonialism, she realized, "was no longer a matter of my own maligned fate but a system of evil whose tentacles reached into every phase of African life."
In the decade and a half after she buried her son, Blouin reinvented herself as an adviser to leading politicians in independent Africa. Embodying pan-Africanism, she befriended, counseled or lobbied the first presidents or prime ministers of Algeria, both Congos, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Ghana.
She was a canny mobilizer and a gifted orator. In the eyes of her Western critics, however, she was a menacing interloper pulling politicians leftward. The Eisenhower administration worried about her supposed Communist links. The New York Times called her an "advocate of extreme African nationalism." One Belgian official remarked to another newspaper in 1960 that she was "a beautiful woman -- but also a dangerous woman, perhaps the most dangerous in all Africa."
Yet when she died, in 1986, the world hardly took notice. By then she was living alone in Paris and had not been in the news for some years.
Andrée Madeleine Gerbillat was born on Dec. 16, 1921, in the village of Bessou, in Ubangi-Shari, to Josephine Wouassimba, a 14-year-old girl, and Pierre Gerbillat, a 41-year-old Frenchman who worked for an import-export company.
At the age of 3, Andrée was deposited in a Roman Catholic orphanage for mixed-race children -- a common practice at the time, designed both to hide evidence of Europeans' libertine ways (including the crime of outright rape) and to protect partly white children from living in supposedly primitive African conditions.
Life at the orphanage, in Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo, was defined by neglect and abuse. Andrée did not see her parents for five years. Her days were spent learning the catechism and doing embroidery work to raise revenue for the order that ran the facility. At night, she went to bed hungry and fended off mosquitoes. The mother superior employed a hippopotamus-hide whip liberally.
After the nuns tried to pressure Andrée into an arranged marriage at 15, she escaped the orphanage, bloodying her feet as she clambered over a wall capped with shards of glass.
She endured two painful relationships: one with Roger Serruys, with whom she had a daughter, and another with Charles Greutz, whom she married and divorced. She married André Blouin in 1952. A French engineer, he worked for a diamond mining company and had "escaped the colonialist mentality," as she wrote in her memoir. They had two children.
When Blouin's husband was posted to a gold mine in French Guinea, the independence movement there was gaining steam under the leadership of Ahmed Sékou Touré. Like all other French colonies, Guinea was preparing for a referendum in which it could choose to remain part of France or gain immediate independence.
Blouin stood behind Touré and drove around the country with members of his party, organizing rallies and delivering speeches calling for independence. In September 1958, Guinea was the only one of 20 French territories that chose to leave France.
Through Touré, Blouin met other activists, including Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Félix Houphouet-Boigny, who would lead Ivory Coast for more than three decades. But it was a chance encounter in Guinea's capital, Conakry, that catapulted her to fame.
At a restaurant one evening in January 1960, Blouin overheard men at another table speaking Lingala, a language she knew from her youth. They were nationalist politicians from the Belgian Congo, in town to make contact with Guinean allies.
Through them, Blouin met Antoine Gizenga, the leader of Parti Solidaire Africain, one of the largest political parties in the Belgian Congo. He recruited her to help him campaign for elections that would lead up to independence. In his 2011 memoir, "Ma Vie et Mes Luttes" ("My Life and My Struggles"), Gizenga recalled being struck that this "mother of three children, the oldest of whom was already 20 and the youngest 4, still had in her the ardent desire to serve the African cause."
Blouin, the lone woman in his circle, became the head of the party's women's wing, preaching feminism. Audiences were enraptured.
Herbert Weiss, then a young M.I.T. field researcher and now an emeritus professor of political science at the City University of New York, recalled his fascination with Blouin in a phone interview. "Who is this woman?" he remembered thinking. "She's wearing very fine perfumes. She has an air of Paris about her. And how come she speaks fluent Kikongo?"
Given her inexplicable command of local languages, Belgians spread word that she was a Communist-trained infiltrator. Others called her a witch.
Gizenga's party formed a coalition with that of Patrice Lumumba, Congo's first prime minister, and after the country achieved independence that June, Blouin became chief of protocol in his government. But by the time she took the position, order had broken down: the army had mutinied, and United Nations peacekeepers had been invited in to quell the chaos. Unable to regain control, Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union for help, setting off alarm bells in the West.
For Western diplomats and reporters, Blouin's presence was proof that Congo was turning Communist. She was fiercely anticolonial, and she came from Guinea, a country with Soviet ties.
Blouin was not, in fact, a Communist; she described herself as a socialist who was committed to African nationalism.
Many of her critics ignored her skills as a political tactician and speculated that she must have slept her way to influence.
"Blouin was always seen as a courtesan," said Karen Bouwer, a professor of French at the University of San Francisco who has written about Blouin. "Here was a beautiful, elegant woman moving in high circles. She was an easy target."
Lumumba was overthrown in September 1960 in a coup blessed by the C.I.A., and Blouin was expelled from Congo.
When the Congolese opposition took up arms against the country's military dictator, Joseph Mobutu (who later changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko), Blouin acted as their spokeswoman, first from Algiers and then from Brazzaville, where President Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria sent her on a humanitarian mission to help children orphaned by the rebellions.
Her husband divorced her in 1973, and she moved to Paris, where she became a den mother to African leftists, opening her rent-controlled apartment on the outskirts of the city to opposition figures and revolutionaries who happened to be passing through. She made rice and stew and served whiskey and wine.
Blouin remained committed to her political beliefs to the end. Even as Touré imprisoned, exiled and killed tens of thousands of political opponents, she refused to denounce him. Devoted to the nationalist heroes she had come to know in the 1950s and '60s, she turned a blind eye when they embraced unsavory tactics.
"She did not want to know," said Monique Chajmowiez, an editor in Paris who was friends with Blouin, "because for her, that was the most wonderful time of her life."
In 1984, sick with lymphoma, Blouin shocked a symposium on Congo by asking attendees for a moment of silence in memory of Pierre Mulele, a politician-turned-insurgent who was tortured to death by Mobutu's soldiers. Some scholars, horrified at the idea of honoring the leader of a violent, Communist-backed revolution, walked out of the conference.
By then Blouin was depressed and having trouble making ends meet. Soon she stopped cancer treatment. Her daughter Eve Blouin said she had grown despondent over the oppression that continued even after the end of colonialism. She died on April 9, 1986, at 65.
Stuart A. Reid is a managing editor at Foreign Affairs and the author of a forthcoming book from Pantheon Books about the 1960s Congo crisis.

Texto completo: Moderates who panic at the prospect of Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee have some good reasons to do so " above all, the risk that he will pave the way to Donald Trump's reelection. On that, count me as one of the worried.
It's nevertheless hard not to recoil from some of the hyperbole being heaped on the Vermont senator and his platform. According to both Trump and some Democrats, Sanders would transform the United States into a jumbo-sized version of Venezuela or Cuba while doubling down on Trump's abandonment of U.S.-leadership around the world.
A look at Sanders's speeches and statements in recent years provides a different picture, at least in foreign policy. What emerges is a politician strongly shaped by his opposition to U.S. military interventions abroad, but also by a conviction that the United States should do what it can to support democracy and resist authoritarianism. That distinguishes him sharply not only from Trump but also from some of the Democratic candidates cast as moderates.
Much of the recent coverage of Sanders's international record has focused on the trip he took to the Soviet Union 32-years ago. Yet a better guide to the candidate's actual thinking in 2020 is the formal foreign policy address he delivered in 2017 in Fulton, Mo., the site of Winston Churchill's indelible 'Iron Curtain' address.
Sanders paid homage to Churchill, saying he 'strongly agree[d]' with his famous precept that 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms.' He then outlined a global role for the United States as a 'champion' of 'the values of freedom, democracy and justice.'
'Our goal is to not only strengthen American democracy, but to work in solidarity with supporters of democracy around the world,' Sanders said. 'In the struggle of democracy vs. authoritarianism, we intend to win.' He singled out Russia, saying, 'Today I say to Mr. [Vladimir] Putin: We will not allow you to undermine American democracy or democracies around the world.'
That stand compares favorably with Trump's pandering to the Kremlin and other autocratic regimes. It also looks good compared to some of the declarations of Mike Bloomberg, who has said China's Xi Jinping is 'not a dictator' and compared Putin's seizure of the Crimea in Ukraine to the U.S. annexation of California.
But what, you say, of the undeniably undemocratic regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, which Sanders is frequently accused of supporting? It's true he's been softer on them than on right-wing dictatorships. In the 1980s, like a lot of American liberals (John F. Kerry comes to mind), he favored Nicaragua's Sandinista government over U.S.-backed 'contra' rebels.
Yet Sanders is unambiguous now about Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, whom he called 'a vicious tyrant' last year. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, Sanders said in December, 'has since become a dictator, and I think that's unfortunate.' He said he hopes Cuba 'moves toward a more democratic society.' As for the former Soviet Union, he told the New York Times it 'was an authoritarian dictatorship, and that's what I believed then and that's what I believe the case to be today.'
What's driven Sanders's equivocations toward some of these regimes is his virulent opposition to U.S. foreign military interventions, as well as other operations aimed at regime change. In his Fulton speech, he inveighed against U.S.-backing for coups in Iran in 1953 and Chile in 1973, along with the war in Iraq. 'Far too often,' he said, 'American intervention and the use of American military power has produced unintended consequences which have caused incalculable harm.'
Again, Sanders's position is not very different from other liberals of his generation, and the likely consequence " a refusal to dispatch Marines to Caracas or cruise missiles to Tehran " doesn't distinguish him from other Democratic candidates, or (so far) Trump. Meanwhile, it's worth noting that Sanders does say that military force is sometimes necessary and that terrorism remains a threat. He supports NATO, and he harshly condemned Trump for withdrawing U.S.-troops from northern Syria at the expense of Kurds who fought the Islamic State.
There's little question that a President Sanders would cause the foreign policy 'blob' some heartburn. He's a hardcore protectionist on trade, though he probably wouldn't follow Trump in wielding tariffs as political weapons. Sanders wants to cut defense spending considerably. But he surely would try to reverse the damage done by Trump to U.S. alliances and revive multilateral initiatives, such as action on global warming.
Above all, if his speeches are to be believed, Sanders would put the United States back on the side of global democracy and human rights at a time when those causes desperately need bolstering. Would other Democrats do as much? Not all of them have made it clear.

Texto completo: When the history of our era is written, scholars will search for larger causes to explain its bitterness and contradictions, despite so much wealth. Was it globalization? Populism? Economic inequality? Polarization? Greed? To this list you can now add an unlikely candidate: the nuclear family.
In a powerful essay for the Atlantic " 'The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake' " New York Times columnist David Brooks argues that the family structure we've held up as the cultural ideal for the past half century has been a catastrophe for many.
By 'nuclear family,' he means a married mother and father and some kids. The alternative arrangement was 'the extended family,' which included not only Mom, Dad and the children but also close relatives " cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents " as well as family friends.
The great defect of the nuclear family, Brooks asserts, is that if there's a crisis " a death, divorce, job loss, poor school grades " there's no backup team. Children are most vulnerable to these disruptions and often are left to fend for themselves. There's a downward spiral. 'In many sectors of society,' Brooks writes, 'nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families, [and] single-parent families into chaotic families or no families.'
People could increasingly go their own way. The advent of the birth-control pill encouraged people to have sex outside of marriage. Women's entrance into the labor market made it easier for them to support themselves. Modern appliances (washing machines, dryers) made housework simpler.
As Brooks sees it, almost everyone loses under this system. The affluent can best cope with it, because they can usually afford what's needed (day care, tutors) to support their children. Otherwise, the picture is bleak.
Children have it worst. Brooks cites an avalanche of statistics. In 1960, about 5-percent of children were born to unmarried women. Now that's about 40-percent. In 1960, about 11-percent of children lived apart from their fathers; in 2010, the figure was 27-percent.
But adult men and women also have their share of troubles. There's a vicious circle at work, notes Brooks: 'People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers. People who don't have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families. . . . The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized.'
Brooks says he wrote the article to stimulate experiments that aim to stabilize family life using the extended family " not the nuclear family " as the model. Granted, the problem may not be as big as Brooks imagines. Estimates by the Census Bureau and others indicate that about 60-percent of Americans live in the state where they were born. Presumably, many of these people stayed put because they valued nearby family ties.
Still, whatever the figures, there's little doubt that reversing the breakdown of families, and its consequences, is one of the urgent tasks of social policy in the 21st-century. We have been struggling unsuccessfully with it since the 'Moynihan Report' in 1965. (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later became a U.S. senator, warned that the breakdown of black marriage rates would have a devastating effect on African Americans' well-being.) The report proved highly controversial, and some branded Moynihan a racist.
But even if we could magically eliminate all considerations of class and race, it's not clear that a workable model would emerge. The conditions needed to broach a debate over family policies strike at the heart of Americans' political and cultural conflicts. Brooks put it this way:
'We value privacy and individual freedom too much. Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose.'
Brooks finds both liberals and conservatives unequal to the task of dealing candidly with family breakdown. 'Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning. Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; 'go live in a nuclear family' is really not relevant advice. . . . the majority [of households] are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families.' He's just as tough on progressives. They 'still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them . . . . But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people.'
The larger issue is how we judge our times. We are constantly deluged with economic studies and statistics, implying that economic outcomes are the only ones that matter. The reality is that any national scorecard of well-being must take a much broader view. How well families do in preparing children for adulthood and how well they transmit important values is a much higher standard for success.

"Phantom Lady" spotlights the woman genius behind Hitchcock

Texto completo: A ghost comes to vibrant life in Christina Lane’s “Phantom Lady: Hollywood Producer Joan Harrison, the Forgotten Woman Behind Hitchcock.”
Harrison is the ghost, or the titular phantom. Aside from film buffs and scholars, few know of her work. Yet Lane, chairwoman of the cinema department at the University of Miami, claims Harrison is “one of the last great untold stories of the classical Hollywood era.” Lane’s keenly observed and illuminating biography backs that assertion.
Nothing was spectral about Harrison’s life and career. Growing up in Guildford, Surrey, after World War I, she was an energetic, assertive and talented young Englishwoman. At 15, she published film reviews. After schooling at the Sorbonne, then Oxford University, she wrote short stories. She also read voraciously – mysteries, horror stories and true crime tales.
In late 1933, Harrison, then 26, answered an ad for an assistant that rising film director Alfred Hitchcock had posted. After a brief interview, Hitchcock hired Harrison to join him at Gaumont-British Picture Corporation.
While she may occasionally have poured Hitchcock tea and jotted notes, Harrison from the start played an active role in shaping his films. A master of control as well as suspense, Hitchcock nevertheless drew upon Harrison’s keen sense of film narratives. “Her sensibilities,” Lane writes, “would help lay the foundation for Hitchcock’s overall cinematic approach.”
Working with the director’s wife, Alma Reville, Harrison bolstered the female roles in “Young and Innocent” (1937) and “The Lady Vanishes” (1938), turning the films into tales of “spirited heroines who seek adventure, truth, and justice and are willing to act on their convictions.”
Hitchcock insisted Harrison stay beside him when he came to the United States. Here she challenged producer David O. Selznick to transform the heroine of “Rebecca” (1940) played by Joan Fontaine from a mousy naif to an often assertive heroine. Not only did Harrison earn a screenwriting Oscar nomination that year for “Rebecca,” but a second nod for Hitchcock’s “Foreign Correspondent” (1940).
However happy Harrison was as part of the Hitchcock entourage, she struck out on her own in 1943, to produce and write screenplays. She signed on at Universal Pictures, thus becoming the first woman producer at a major studio.
Note of Harrison’s achievement suggested that stereotypes die hard. Harrison, The New York Times wrote, was “’the only producer anywhere, with dimples and a 24-inch waistline.’”
Harrison worked almost exclusively with film noir as the form peaked in the 1940s and early ‘50s. But on noir’s shadowy, rain-slicked streets, she effected a major thematic change: her scripts replaced noir’s treacherous femmes fatales with appealing, productive women. Thus, a female gumshoe becomes vital to helping clear a man unjustly accused of murder in “Phantom Lady” (1944).
Lane follows Harrison’s solo career, detailing the novels and stories she was drawn to and the first-rate teams she gathered to realize her visions. Lane’s analyses of performances and images in Harrison’s films – “The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry” (1945), “Nocturne” (1946),” and 1947’s double shot of “Ride the Pink Horse” and “They Won’t Believe Me” – sharply delineate the films’ styles and themes.
With television eclipsing film in the 1950s, Harrison went full circle, signing on as producer of “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” and, in effect, importing her noir style to the small screen.
Along the way, Harrison led a personal life as alluring and mysterious as her career. She loved creating diverse images with fashion, hairstyles and makeup while pursuing equally romantic affairs. There were liaisons with actors Clark Gable and Kirk Douglas and writer Irwin Shaw. Eventually she married spy novelist Eric Ambler. An unidentified woman, though, was said to be the love of her life.
Lane’s rich portrait of Harrison virtually contradicts this book’s title. Harrison was not “the woman behind Hitchcock”; she was beside him and sometimes ahead of him. On her own, she made her own distinctive contributions to American film. Now, we have that story.

White preachers assisted in violence, lynchings

Texto completo: White lynch mobs in America murdered at least 4,467 people between 1883 and 1941, hanging, burning, dismembering, garroting and blowtorch-ing their victims. Their violence was widespread but not indiscriminate: about 3,300 of the lynched were black, according to the most recent count by sociologists Charles Seguin and David Rigby. The remaining dead were white, Mexican, of Mexican descent, Native American, Chinese or Japanese.
Such numbers, based on verifiable newspaper reports, represent a minimum. The full human toll of racial lynching may remain ever beyond reach. Religion was no barrier for these white murderers either. White preachers incited racial violence, joined the Ku Klux Klan and lynched black people.
When considering American racial terror, the first question to answer is not how a lynch mob could kill a man of the cloth but why white lynch mobs killed at all. The typical answer from Southern apologists was that only black men who raped white women were targeted. In this view, lynching was "popular justice" - the response of an aggrieved community to a heinous crime.
Journalists like Ida B. Wells and early sociologists like Monroe Work saw through that smokescreen, finding that only about 20% to 2 5% of lynching victims were alleged rapists. About 3% were women. Some were children.
Black people were lynched for murder or assault, or on suspicion that they committed those crimes. They could also be lynched for looking at a white woman or for bumping the shoulder of a white woman. Some were killed for being near or related to someone accused of the aforementioned offenses.
Identifying the dead is supremely difficult work. As sociologists Amy Kate Bailey and Stewart Tolnay argue persuasively in their 2015 book "Lynched," very little is known about lynching victims beyond their gender and race. But by cross-referencing news reports with census data, scholars and civil rights organizations are uncovering more details.
One might expect that mobs seeking to destabilize the black community would focus on the successful and the influential -people like preachers or prominent business owners. Instead, lynching disproportionately targeted lower-status black people - individuals society would not protect, like the agricultural worker Sam Hose of Georgia and men like Henry Smith, a Texas handyman accused of raping and killing a 3-year-old girl.
The rope and the pyre snuffed out primarily the socially marginal: the unemployed, the unmarried, the precarious - often not the prominent - who expressed any discontentment with racial caste. That's because lynching was a form of social control. By killing workers with few connections who could be economically replaced -and doing so in brutal, public ways that struck terror into black communities - lynching kept white supremacy on track.
So black ministers weren't often lynching victims, but they could be targeted if they got in the way. IT. Burgess, a preacher in Putnam County, Florida, was hanged in 1894 after being accused of planning to instigate a revolt, according to a May 30, 1894, story in the Atlanta Constitution newspaper. Later that year, in December, the Constitution also reported, Lucius Turner, a preacher near West Point, Georgia, was shot by two brothers for apparently writing an insulting note to their sister.
Ida B. Wells wrote in her 1895 editorial "A Red Record" about Reverend King, a minister in Paris, Texas, who was beaten with a Winchester Rifle and placed on a train out of town. His offense, he said, was being the only person in Lamar County to speak against the horrific 1893 lynching of Smith.
In each of these cases, the victim's profession was ancillary to their lynching. But preaching was not incidental to black pastors' resistance to lynching. Many, like the Washington, D.C., Presbyterian pastor Francis Grimke, preached to their congregations about racial violence. Grimke argued for comprehensive anti-racist education as a way to undermine the narratives that led to lynching.
Some white pastors decried racial terror, too. But others used the pulpit to instigate violence. On June 21, 1903, the white pastor of Olivet Presbyterian church in Delaware used his religious leadership to incite a lynching.
Preaching to a crowd of 3,000 gathered in downtown Wilmington, the Reverend Robert A. Elwood urged the jury in the trial of George White - a black farm laborer accused of raping and killing a 17-year-old white girl, Helen Bishop - to pronounce White guilty speedily. Otherwise, Elwood continued, according to a June 23, 1903, New York Times article, White should be lynched. He cited the Biblical text 1 Corinthians 5:13, which orders Christians to "expel the wicked person from among you."
White was dragged out of jail the next day, bound and burned alive in front of 2,000 people. The following Sunday, a black pastor named Montrose W. Thornton discussed the week's barbarities with his own congregation in Wilmington. He urged self-defense.
"There is but one part left for the persecuted Negro when charged with a crime and when innocent. Be a law unto yourself," he told his parishioners. "Die in your tracks, perhaps drinking the blood of your pursuer."
Newspapers around the country denounced both sermons. An editorial in the Washington Star said both pastors had "contributed to the worst passions of the mob."

U.S. takes step toward peace deal with Taliban

Texto completo: MUNICH - U.S. officials said on Friday they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable. If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India. That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met on Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president. But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart. Trump pulled.back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is highly specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump. One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan - though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down. But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict. In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place. It calls for a complete withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban - something the Taliban has long refused - on a long-term power-sharing settlement. Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.
In September, American and Taliban negotiators were close to an agreement, and Trump planned to meet Taliban leaders in person, before he dropped the deal because of a Taliban attack.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors have declined to charge former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, closing an investigation into whether the longtime target of President Donald Trump's ire lied to federal officials about his involvement in a news media disclosure, McCabe's legal team said Friday.
The decision, coming at the end of a tumultuous week between the Justice Department and the White House, is likely to further agitate a president who has loudly complained that federal prosecutors have pursued cases against his allies but not against his perceived political enemies.
The action resolves a criminal investigation that began nearly two years ago with a referral from the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which concluded that McCabe had repeatedly lied about having authorized a subordinate to share information with a newspaper reporter for a 2016 article about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
The case was handled by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which was at the center of a public rift with Justice Department leadership this week over the recommended sentence for Trump ally Roger Stone. Senior Justice Department officials overruled a decision on a recommended prison sentence that they felt was too harsh, prompting the trial team to quit the case. Attorney General William Barr also took a rare public swipe at Trump by saying in a television interview that the president's tweets about the Stone case and other matters were making his job "impossible."
Separately, the Justice Department has begun reviewing the handling of the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.
On Friday, prosecutors notified McCabe's attorneys in a phone call and a letter that they were closing the case. The letter, signed by the chief of the office's public corruption unit, did not give a precise reason but said the decision was reached after "careful consideration" and "based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time."
McCabe's lawyers, Michael Bromwich and David Schertler, said they were gratified by the decision.
"At long last, justice has been done in this matter," the lawyers said in a statement. "We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought."
Speaking Friday on CNN, where he works as a contributor, McCabe said it was an "absolute disgrace" that the investigation had taken so long and that he was relieved to be done with a process that he described as "so unbelievably tense."
Though federal prosecutors wrote that they consider the matter closed, Justice Department actions in the last few months have proven unpredictable, with a willingness to scrutinize or revisit decisions that had appeared resolved.
McCabe, a frequent target of Trump's attacks, has denied that he intentionally misled anyone. He has said his 2018 firing - for what the Justice Department called "lack of candor" - was politically motivated. He sued the Justice Department in August, saying officials had used the inspector general's conclusions as a pretext to rid the FBI of leaders Trump perceived as biased against him.
The decision is likely to further exacerbate tensions between Trump and Barr, who before speaking out in the television interview had privately complained to aides and the president himself that Trump's comments about the Justice Department were undercutting his politdical agenda and raising questions about the department's credibility. The White House was not given a heads-up about the decision beforehand, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
The moment came against a backdrop of growing anger from Trump at the Justice Department. The president has seethed that more of his political enemies have not been charged, included former FBI Director James Comey and his associates.
The president was particularly incensed no charges were filed over Comey's handling of memos about his interactions with Trump, a matter that was referred to the Justice Department for potential prosecution, according to a White House official and Republican close to the White House who weren't authorized to speak publicly about private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The president angrily denounced the decision and berated Barr over it, according to the officials. Aides expected that the decision not to charge McCabe could produce a similar eruption of rage. Trump did not address the matter during a media appearance Friday.

Texto completo: Headnote His racist stop-and-frisk policy as New York mayor can't be forgotten
Let's state some facts: Michael Ruben Bloomberg notoriously expanded stop-and-frisk in New York City to obscene proportions, violating the bodies and constitutional rights of mostly minority men and boys, and not only defended the policy, but mocked his detractors and bragged about it.
What Bloomberg did as mayor amounted to a police occupation of minority neighborhoods, a terroristic pressure campaign, with little evidence that it was accomplishing the goal of sustained, long-term crime reduction.
Nearly 90% of the people stopped were completely innocent. He knewthat. They were the collateral damage in his crusade, Black and brown bodies up against walls and down on the ground, groped in the middle of the city by strange men with guns, a vast expanse of human psychological wreckage about which he couldn't care less.
A recording from a speech Bloomberg delivered at the Aspen Institute in 2015 underscores just how callous and cavalier he was in his thinking about this racist policy.
"Ninety-five percent of your murders - murderers and murder victims - fit one MO," Bloomberg said. "You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city."
He goes on to say: "One of the unintended consequences is, people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana, they're all minorities.' Yes, that's true. Why? Because put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is."
Later he says, "The way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them."
So many things to dissect here.
First, Bloomberg didn't see individual criminals, many of whom happened to be minorities; he saw a class of criminals who were minorities. "They are male, minorities, 16 to 25." Many of these were children.
He was articulating an explicitly race-based policy.
He spoke nonchalantly about giving these young people criminal records for marijuana, ignoring the enormous harm these criminal records cause to individuals and whole communities. And a vast majority of those people and communities were minorities.
As Daniel Nichanian, editor of The Appeal, wrote this week on Twitter: "Each year of Bloomberg's 12-year mayorship, at least 50 percent of the people arrested for marijuana were Black. And at least 85 percent were nonwhite each year, usually much higher. That's tens of thousands of people each year."
And Bloomberg defended the practice by saying that the only way to get the guns out of the kids' hands was to throw the kids against a wall. But nearly 90% of these young people were completely innocent. They had done absolutely nothing wrong, let alone possess a gun.
The Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan produced a report that became part of a class-action lawsuit against the city in 2010. It found that "(s)eizures of weapons or contraband are extremely rare. Overall, guns are seized in less than 1 percent of all stops: 0.15 percent. ... Contraband, which may include weapons but also includes drugs or stolen property, is seized in 1.75 percent of all stops."
As Fagan wrote, "The NYPD stop-and-frisk tactics produce rates of seizures of guns or other contraband that are no greater than would be produced simply by chance."
Bloomberg didn't care about any of this. He didn't care about these innocent Black and brown bodies. Somewhere in each barrel of good apples there was a bad one, and he was willing to spoil the whole batch to purge that rare bad one.
These minority boys were being hunted. Their neighborhoods were experiencing an occupation. Citizens wanted crime abatement, but they didn't expect apartheid.
And yet in the same way that white people in New York City had turned away when Bloomberg was executing his racist policy, many Democrats - including some Black ones - appear willing now to turn a blind eye to his past.
Bloomberg is blanketing the airwaves with slick ads and glamouring liberals into amnesia and acquiescence. These liberals are then gaming out scenarios in which Bloomberg is the last, best option.
They don't recognize that Bloomberg is the master of this sort of emotional manipulation. During his 2001 campaign for mayor, he ran ads that The New York Times noted focused on old crime fears.
"The scenes, set to dramatic synthesizer music punctuated by sharp blasts of percussion, come from what could well be called 'N.Y.P.D. Bloomberg,' " The Times reported. "They seem calibrated to throw fear into the hearts of the citizenry at the thought of crime mushrooming again in a post-Giuliani New York City."
No amount of Democrats' antiTrump fear and panic will ever erase what Bloomberg did. Democrats have a field of fascinating candidates. Many have some crime and justice issues of their own, but nothing approaching the scale of Bloomberg's racist policy.
If Democrats cast aside all of these candidates in favor of Bloomberg and his wealth, I fear they will be making it harder to defeat Trump in November.

Trump claims 'legal right' to meddle in federal criminal cases

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump asserted Friday that he had the legal right to intervene in federal criminal cases, a day after Attorney General William Barr publicly rebuked him for attacks on Justice Department prosecutors and others involved in the case of Roger Stone, the president's longtime friend.
In a morning tweet, Trump quoted Barr saying that the president "has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case." The president said he had "so far chosen" not to interfere in a criminal case even though he insisted that he was not legally bound to do so.
"This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!" he said.
Though he and Barr both said the president has not directly asked for any specific inquiries, Trump has long pressured law enforcement officials both publicly and privately to open investigations into political rivals and to drop inquiries. Trump also pressed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to retake control of the Russia investigation after he recused himself.
The assertion by the president, which implicitly rejected a request by Barr to stop tweeting about the department's cases, adds to the mounting controversy over the decision by senior Justice Department officials to overrule prosecutors who had recommended a seven to nine year sentence for Stone, who was convicted of seven felonies in a bid to obstruct a congressional investigation that threatened the president.
That recommendation infuriated Trump, who called the department's handling of the case "a disgrace" and later praised Barr after his top officials intervened to recommend a lighter sentence for Stone. The four prosecutors who were overruled resigned from the case in protest; one quit the department entirely.
Seeking to calm the upheaval in his department, Barr on Thursday issued a pointed denunciation of Trump's tweets, which included criticism of the federal judge overseeing the Stone case and even the jury forewoman. Barr said the commentary from the president made it "impossible for me to do my job" and insisted that "I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody."
"I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me," said Barr, who has been one of Trump's closest and most reliable allies since taking over at the Justice Department.
Past presidents in both parties have respected long standing traditions that are aimed at preventing political influence from the White House on Justice Department investigations, especially criminal inquiries that involved administration officials or friends of the president. The rules have been in place since the Watergate investigation, in which former President Richard Nixon sought to pressure the FBI.
Trump has repeatedly ignored those traditions, making contact with FBI officials and communicating with top Justice Department officials through Twitter and in person. His claim in Friday's tweet that he has "so far chosen" not to interfere in criminal cases is contradicted by a record of his actions during the his three years in office.
Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russian election interference inquiry, documented numerous instances in which the president sought to obstruct justice as federal investigators examined the activities of Trump's White House advisers and former campaign aides. In his final report, Mueller said that Justice Department rules did not allow sitting presidents to be indicted.

Beijing sets stringent new quarantine rules

Texto completo: Chinese state-run television announced on its website Friday evening that everyone returning to Beijing would be required to isolate themselves for 14 days.
Anyone who does not comply "shall be held accountable according to law," according to a text of the order released by state television. The order was issued by a Communist Party "leading group" at the municipal level, not the national Communist Party.
It was the latest sign that China's leaders were still struggling to set the right balance between restarting the economy and continuing to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the country's top officials met and issued orders that included a mandate to help people to return to workplaces from their hometowns. Tens of millions had gone home to celebrate Lunar New Year holidays before the government acknowledged the seriousness of the epidemic. They have faced local government checkpoints on the way back to work and then lengthy quarantines upon their return to big cities.
But while national leaders may be worried that travel restrictions and quarantines may be preventing companies from finding enough workers to resume full production, that did not stop Beijing municipal leaders from further tightening controls Friday evening in the city.
The policy may reduce the chances that people returning from the hinterlands could infect the country's elite.
The new rules also require those returning to the city to give advance warning of their arrival to authorities in their residential area. China maintained extensive controls on citizens' movements under Mao, and some of the institutions and rules from that period have been reemerging lately.
Even before Beijing issued its new rules, neighborhood committees had been playing an increasingly assertive role across the country, including in Shanghai. They have been demanding that recent returnees isol ate themselves for 14 days upon arrival, venturing out for little except food.
Summer Olympics in uncertainty
International Olympic Committee officials Friday said that the Summer Games in Tokyo would go on as planned, citing discussions with the Wcrld Health Organization.
"Certainly the advice we have received externally from Ihe WHO is that there is no case for any contingency plans or canceling the games or moving :he games," John Coates, head of an IOC inspection team, told reporters. Asked if he was "100% confident" that the Games would take place, Coates said "Yes."
A spokesman for the WHO said in an emailed statement that the organization was not advising that large gatherings be canceled.
The Games are scheduled to take place between July 24 end Aug. 9 this summer in Japan, the country that has endured :he largest number of coronavirus cases outside China - over ¿50, including 218 aboard a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama. On Thursday, Japanese authorities announced the country's first death of a patient who had contracted the virus.
Blood plasma treatment
A senior healtn official in Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, has called on residents who have recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood plasma, believing cheir naturally produced antibodies could be esed to treat patients who are still sick
Dr. Zhang Dingyu, director of tne Imyintan Hospital in Wuhan, made his appeal Thursday after Chinese researchers said they behaved that such antibody treatments could help people recover from the virus.
T ne search for a crug capable c: treating or curing the virus has frustrated researchers, as rates of infection and death s continue to mount.
The government is prescribing a combination of antiviral drugs and traditional Chinese medicine. But Thursday, China National Biotec Group, a stateowned company under the Ministry of Health, said it had found that administering a round of human antibodies Irom the survivors to more than 10 critically ? patients caused inflammation levels to drop significantly after 12 to 24 hours of treatment.
The company called the use of plasma "the most effective me:hod, which can significantly reduce the mortality of critically ill patients."
China records mere than 5,000 new cases in 24 hours.
Numbers continued to climb after the government changed i he criteria by which it tracks cor firmed cases. China on Friday reported 5,090 new coronavirus cases and 121 new deaths in the previous 24 hours.
Authorities said a total of63,851 people had been infected by the roronavirus and at least 1,380 had been killed by the epidem-C. Most of the cases occurred in Himei province, the center of the julbreak, which recorded 4,823 new cases and 116 deaths over the same period.

Texto completo: The Trump administration is deploying law enforcement tactical units from the southern border as part of a supercharged arrest operation in sanctuary cities across the country, an escalation in the president's battle against localities that refuse to participate in immigration enforcement.
The specially trained officers are being sent to cities including Chicago and New York to boost the enforcement power of local Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to two officials who are familiar with the secret operation. Additional agents are expected to be sent to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit and Newark, New Jersey.
Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, confirmed the agency was deploying 100 officers to work with ICE, which conducts arrests in the interior of the country, "in order to enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security."
The deployment of the teams will run from February through May, according to an email sent to СВР personnel, which was read to The New York Times by one official familiar with the planning.
Among the agents being deployed to sanctuary cities are members of the elite tactical unit known as BORTAC, which acts essentially as the SWAT team of the Border Patrol. With additional gear such as stun grenades and enhanced Special Forces-type training, including sniper certification, the officers typically conduct high-risk operations targeting individuals who are known to be violent, many of them with extensive criminal records.
The unit's work often takes place in the most rugged and swelteringly hot areas of the border. It can involve breaking into stash houses maintained by smuggling operations that are known to be filled with drugs and weapons.
In sanctuary cities, the BORTAC agents will be asked to support interior officers in run-of-the-mill immigration arrests, the officials said.
In a statement, ICE's acting director, Matthew Albence, said the deployment comes in response to policies adopted by sanctuary cities, which have made it harder for immigration agents to do their jobs.
"As we have noted for years, in jurisdictions where we are not allowed to assume custody of aliens from jails, our officers are forced to make at-large arrests of criminal aliens who have been released into communities," he said. "When sanctuary cities release these criminals back to the street, it increases the occurrence of preventable crimes, and more importantly, preventable victims."
But Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of СВР, which oversees tactical units along the border, said sending the officers to conduct immigration enforcement within cities, where they are not trained to work, could escalate situations that are already volatile. He called the move a "significant mistake."
"If you were a police chief and you were going to make an apprehension for a relatively minor offense, you don't send the SWAT team. And BORTAC is the SWAT team," said Kerlikowske, who is the former chief of police in Seattle. "They're trained for much more hazardous missions than this."
ICE agents typically seek out people with criminal convictions or multiple immigration violations as their primary targets for deportation, but family members and friends are often swept up in the enforcement net in what are known as "collateral" arrests, and many such people could now be caught up in any enhanced operations.
ICE leadership requested the help in sanctuary jurisdictions because agents there often struggle to track down immigrants living in the country illegally without the help of the police and other state and local agencies. Law enforcement officers in areas that refuse to cooperate with ICE and the Border Patrol - which include both liberal and conservative parts of the country - often argue that doing so pushes people living in the country illegally further into the shadows, ultimately making cities less safe because that segment of the population becomes less likely to report crimes or cooperate with investigations.
The goal of the new joint operation, one of the officials said, was to increase arrests in the sanctuary jurisdictions by at least 35%.
Other recent attempts at aggressive enforcement by ICE have faltered, such as a series of raids targeting more than 2,000 migrant families that were planned during the summer of 2019. Trump's advance warnings on Twitter led many of those who were targeted to refuse to open their front doors, and ultimately, only 35 of those who had been targeted were arrested in the operation's first several weeks.
Even with the added show of force from BORTAC, agents will be limited in their abilities compared to the police or sheriff's deputies. Unlike operations on the border, where BORTAC agents may engage in armed confrontations with drug-smuggling suspects using armored vehicles, immigration agents in cities are enforcing civil, rather than criminal, infractions. They are not allowed to forcibly enter properties in order to make arrests, and the presence of BORTAC agents, while helpful in boosting the number of agents on the ground, may prove most useful for the visual message it sends.
Many ICE agents say their jobs have become increasingly difficult, three years into Trump's presidency, because of robust campaigns by immigrant advocacy organizations seeking to safeguard immigrants living in the country illegally by educating them on the legal limitations that ICE officers face. As a result, in many communities where immigrants living in the country illegally reside, when ICE agents are spotted, people now turn immediately to their phones to alert neighbors that they should stay inside.

Many of the young girls who attended Saturday's Rosie Revere Engineer Day were more interested in doing than talking.
Volunteer John Shirron encouraged youngsters to try their hand at civil engineering by designing an airport. It was an appropriate exercise since Saturday's event at Pearson Field Education Center was next door to one of the nation's oldest continuously operating airfields.
Shirron explained they needed to glue a control tower, taxiways and one or more runways to yellow paper and give their airport a three-letter code, such as PDX for Portland International Airport.
He patiently asked 5-year-old Madeline Alford what airports she had been to but received more information from her mother, Alyssa Alford, including that the Vancouver girl has been to PDX and Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX.
“Did you go to Disneyland?” Shirron asked Madeline. “How did I know that?”
Saturday's event featured stations to introduce young girls to engineering and encourage them to pursue careers in STEM, or science, technology, engineering and math. Each station included a “Great Women in Engineering” display for women who blazed a trail these girls might someday take.
Saturday's event took its name from “Rosie Revere, Engineer,” a 2013 children's book written by Andrea Beaty and illustrated by David Robert. The New York Times bestseller tells the story of a shy girl who dreams of becoming an engineer and conducts experiments she hides under her bed.
One day, her great-great aunt, Rose, comes to visit. Rose is “Rosie the Riveter,” the iconic character representing women who worked in aircraft factories, shipyards and other industrial sites during World War II.
Rose reveals that she has always dreamed of flying. Rosie Revere sets out to build a flying machine, but her contraption hovers for a moment before crashing to the ground. The experience instills an important lesson in the would-be engineer:
“Life might have its failures, but this was not it,” Beaty wrote. “The only true failure can come if you quit.”
The first 50 kids who completed all stations received copies of “Rosie Revere's Big Project Book for Bold Engineers,” which provides guidance for drawing and making more than 40 items.
Saturday's event had a good turnout on a rainy day as children scampered between different stations under and besides historic aircraft.
Michelle Marra, Pearson Field Education Center director, said more than 550 people attended Rosie Revere Engineer Day, a big increase from the 50 who turned out for last year's inaugural event.
“Today, we exceeded that in 13 minutes,” she said “We had people here before we even opened the doors.”
The stations taught youngsters about one law of motion, how circuits work and what happens when you combine an acid (lemon juice) with a base (baking soda).
“We're trying to take big concepts and bring them down to the kid's level,” Marra said.
The event was geared toward young girls, in part because only 14 percent of working engineers today are women, Marra said.
“We want to inspire girls and give them positive role models early on,” she said.
So what about all the boys at Saturday's event?
“Just because we want to empower women doesn't mean by any means we want to exclude boys,” Marra said.
Clark College engineering students, part of the “NERD Girls and GEEKS” program, operated two stations. NERD stands for “Not even remotely dorky,” and GEEKS is an acronym for “Gentlemen Engineering Enthusiasts and Kindred Spirits.”
The engineering students sought to illustrate Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion — For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction — using balloons, straws, pencils, tape and pins to create a straw and balloon that would spin on the end of a pencil.
Many kids didn't have enough lung power to fill the balloon, which is when mom, dad or another adult stepped in. The sight of spinning balloon wheel never failed to bring a smile to the child's face.
“Pretty cool stuff,” said Justin Sullivan, a second-year mechanical engineering student at Clark College. “It's a nice similarity between my classes and the kid's version, if you will.”
Tina Barsotti, a mechanical engineering professor at Clark College who chairs the Engineering, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, and Surveying and Geomatics Department, said community events serve a dual purpose. They encourage children to consider an engineering career, and they help engineering students hone their interaction skills.
“It's good for the little kids,” Barsotti said. “And it's good for my adult students.”
The Pearson Field Education Center, 201A East Reserve St., is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every Saturday with no admission charge, The center features many hands-on exhibits, including a vertical wind table, computer flight simulators and a device that mimics landing a jet fighter on an aircraft carrier.

Texto completo: More than a week after the U.S. Senate acquitted him of all impeachment charges, President Donald Trump started his day on Twitter, reflecting on his political victory.
In an early morning tweet, he referenced a New York Times’ article from Feb. 1 on the pending outcome of his impeachment trial and re-election chances, which quoted poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Trump also referred to the proceedings as a “witch hunt,” as he often does.
The tweet, posted at about 8 a.m., read: “Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate Impeachment Trial of President Trump. ‘When you strike at the King, Emerson famously said, “you must kill him.’ Mr. Trump’s foes struck at him but did not take him down. A triumphant Mr.Trump emerges from the biggest test of his presidency emboldened, ready to claim exoneration, and take his case of grievance, persecution and resentment to the campaign trail. Peter Baker @nytimes The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!”
Ninety minutes later, Trump left Mar-a-Lago for Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A few supporters watched and waved at the president from the sidelines as the motorcade made its way down Southern Boulevard and Congress Avenue.
At 9:39 a.m., presumably en route to his golf club, Trump tweeted: “IG report on Andrew McCabe: Misled Investigators over roll in news media disclosure...Lacked Candor (Lied) on four separate occasions...Authotized Media Leaks to advance personal interests...IG RECOMMENDED MCCABE’S FIRING. @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle.”
The president returned to Mar-a-Lago just before 3 p.m.
On Friday, federal prosecutors announced that they have no intention of charging former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who was the focus of a grand-jury investigation over accusations from the Justice Department inspector general that he lied about having authorized a subordinate to share information with a newspaper reporter for a 2016 article about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
Trump made waves last week when he posted several tweets in which he attacked the federal judge and prosecutors involved in the case of his longtime associate and friend, Roger Stone.
Trump fired off tweets about how the Stone case was being handled, and at one point, targeted U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presides over the case, by insinuating that she was biased because of her role in sentencing his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and her dismissal of the Benghazi lawsuit against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
The controversy continued when four prosecutors involved in the Stone case resigned when Attorney General William Barr intervened to recommend a lighter sentence for Stone.
But Barr seemed to break away from the president when on Thursday, he told ABC News that Trump’s tweets on open Department of Justice cases, such as Stone’s, made it “impossible” for him to do his job although he insisted Trump had “never asked” him to “do anything in a criminal case.”
On the eve of the president’s arrival Friday, his supporters expressed their opinions about Trump and Barr’s possible role in the Stone case sentencing.
“I think [Barr’s comment] was taken out of context, used again for something against President Trump,” said Cindy Falco-DiCorrado, 61, a Trump supporter from Boynton Beach. “The media takes everything out of context blows it up because they have an agenda, and people are tired of listening to the nonsense.”
Jim Ettwein, Boynton Beach, 71, said he believed it was fine for Trump to tweet. “It’s not Trump’s job to make everything easy for Attorney General Barr. But I understand Attorney General Barr’s position on it. It makes sense.”
On Saturday evening, Trump attended a fundraiser at the home of billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, a few miles up the road from Mar-a-Lago on North County Road.
Trump will be in Daytona today to attend the Daytona 500 as grand marshal for NASCAR’s season opening, making him the first president to be given an honorary role in the pre-race ceremony.
Three other Republican presidents attended the Daytona 500: Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H.W. Bush in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2004.
There will be a 30-mile “no drone” zone established before, during and after the president’s visit to Daytona, the U.S. Secret Service said in a tweet.

Texto completo: Two lanky teenage boys from Monticello, fishing and swimming in the cool Jefferson County rivers, never knew how their lives would diverge. Jim Sledge became a dentist, and best friend Ernest "Boots" Thomas joined the Marines and died on Iwo Jima.
Thomas helped raise the first flag on Mount Suribachi with his fellow Marines in 1945. There will be a 75th anniversary celebration of this flag raising in Monticello at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 21,
"Boots" Thomas and Jim Sledge attended Monticello High School together. They hatched an enthusiastic young man's scheme — travel to South America and make a million dollars.
They were long on enthusiasm but always short on details. To begin this adventure, both young men learned Spanish. Throughout their friendship, they would spike conversations with Spanish words to test each other's understanding of the language. The duo left for college pledging that some day there would be a fiery, wildly successful South American expedition for them.
By Christmastime 'Boots," told Jim that he had decided to join the Marines. He was 17 at the time, knew he was smart enough to pass all the military tests, except one. He was colorblind. "Boots" had an aptitude for memorization, which had helped him learn Spanish. His solution was simple. Memorize the Marine color chart to gain entry. "Boots" was eventually initiated into the 5th Marine division.
"Flags of our Fathers," a Clint Eastwood movie, is the story of the American flag raised over Iwo Jima. The first flag planted on the first Japanese territory taken in World War II. A platoon of brave and frightened men, including "Boots" Thomas, scrambled to the top of the black craggy volcanic Mount Suribachi.
On the way up, they found a small piece of pipe left by the Japanese. With them, they carried a small 2 X 4 American flag. Collectively they drove that pipe with the freshly attached flag into the ground. The American flag caught the wind and fluttered horizontally in the breeze. Lou Lowery, a photographer for Leatherneck magazine, took photos of this historic moment. "Boots" is in the photographs of the first flag-raising.
The Marines caught up in fighting below erupted into cheers. Ships near shore bellowed out and small boats blew their whistles. The battle continued but with a new visible symbol of our power and glory.
While coming down Mount Suribachi, Lou Lowery fell 40 feet when receiving fire. He dropped his camera and he thought the original photos were lost too. Soon, he found the roll of film in his pocket. Another photographer, Joe Rosenthal, took the photos of the second flag-raising. These second photos went home and were published on Feb. 25 in the New York Times.
Jim Sledge has never forgotten his lost adventure partner. He wants "Boots" and his platoon remembered for their bravery.
In 1981, the City of Monticello, Jim Sledge, Pat Smith and many others, erected a memorial to "Boots" on Highway 90. Etched on the memorial is one of the Lou Lowery photographs of the first raising of the flag over Iwo Jima. Dr. Jim Sledge still tends the flowers around the memorial.
The raising of the first small flag inspired the cheering, traumatized, dazed, and ever brave Marines on Iwo Jima. Many of them were about to die. The raising of the second flag on Iwo Jima inspired our nation and became an American icon, a symbol of our triumph in war.
On Feb. 23 1945, "Boots" helped raise the first flag that comforted and roused his fellow Marines. On Feb. 25, 1945, Joe Rosenthal published the picture that inspired all of America. On March 3, 1945, "Boots" died on Iwo Jima.
On Feb. 21, at 10 a.m. there is a 75th anniversary celebration of this flag raising. The ceremony is at the Boots Thomas Memorial located at 930 W. Washington St., Monticello, Florida.
The ceremony is organized by numerous Jefferson County groups including local veterans. Come join them in honoring a local hero.

Texto completo: The Tehrani brothers, Reuben, Youda, and Benjamin, pass time at their Bryn Mawr rug store waiting for customers and sipping sugared tea, concerned about the drift of American feelings against Iranians but more fearful of the disastrous trends facing the family's high-end rug business.
Last year, during the tensions with Iran, they changed the store's name to Bryn Mawr Rugs from Tehrani Brothers to make it less Iranian-sounding, after Reuben heard "go home" from passing drivers. But the brothers called the police in December when someone vandalized the store facade's Persian tiles.
A responding officer said that they should install a surveillance camera and that the department would boost patrols.
But added police protection and a new store name haven't solved the Tehranis' biggest problem: how to rejuvenate a rug business devastated by automation, millennials opting for modern designs, Amazon, and a rug glut with downsizing baby boomers unloading decorative Oriental rugs.
"Also, the Main Line changed," Reuben Tehrani said with resignation. "The newer generation, they don't have the feeling, you know, for fine Persian rugs."
Not only on the Main Line, but everywhere.
Einstein Moomjy, the iconic New Jersey-based retailer with six stores there and in Manhattan, filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2011. Brothers Ted and Ernst Einstein and Walter and Albert Moomjy launched the business in 1955 in Bloomfield, Essex County. When the firm liquidated its final inventory in April 2012, its website called it "the largest bankruptcy liquidation in the history of Oriental rugs." Oriental refers broadly to decorative, hand-knotted rugs, while Persian describes those hand-knotted rugs from Iran. They could be modern or antique.
A 2016 New York Times article datelined from the cradle of the Persian rug business - Shiraz, Iran - talked about the effects of Iranian sanctions on rug exports and the growth of machine-made, or robo-tufted, rugs in China and India. The headline: "The Persian Rug May Not Be Long for This World." A New York Times article two years later didn't do the industry any favors either: "The Rich Have Abandoned Rich-People Rugs."
Roy Maloumian, a big Philadelphia-area dealer, shuttered his 15 stores in Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, and Arizona over the last two years and has been liquidating inventory for many months in his Mount Airy warehouse. "I have closed those down and now I'm working my way out," he said. The rug market "hasn't been that bad," Maloumian said. "I'm closing. I'll be 77 in March. It's time to enjoy the sweet part of life."
Maloumian agrees that millennials consume differently from boomers, but he believes the Oriental rug business could stabilize and "go back to a carriage trade" focusing on high-end buyers "instead of a mass market."
Two-thirds of the 15 to 18 Oriental rug stores in the Philadelphia area have closed since the good times, Reuben Tehrani estimated.
Rug Insider editor Michael Christie dates the origin of the Oriental rug crisis facing the Tehrani brothers - Orthodox Jews whose family lost almost everything when they fled Iran in the late 1970s - to the last recession.
"All the crash of '08 did was reveal that the hand-knotted rug market was buoyed by aspirational buyers who didn't have the real financial means to buy the product," Christie said. "The hand-knotted market was lucky for the last 25 to 30 years to be riding on the housing bubble. And we were not prepared for that bubble to go away."
Bankruptcies and closings pared the number of Oriental rug stores to hundreds in the United States from thousands, Christie said.
"In 2020, it's who has the right size and the right time at the right price all over the world," Christie said. "It's all of these market forces conspiring against a business model that has not kept up with the times. We're not a fast fashion product. We have a very old-world craft product that has not found its way in the modern world."
Still, there are glimmers of hope. "I have a friend in Alabama who moves rugs like it's still the 1980s," Christie said. "I don't know how she does it."
Paige Albright, proprietor of Paige Albright Orientals near Birmingham, Ala., said by email that she markets her business as "Why Knot?" - a play on the words for hand-knotted Persian and Oriental rugs as compared with robo-tufted, machine-made rugs taking over the market. She says she isn't afraid of new approaches such as selling "washed Persians" for customers seeking a new look.
She and her clients "have inherited our grandmothers' pieces and they are sentimental, so we incorporate those and mix with new pieces. I am also selling contemporary rugs along with the antique pieces."
"It is about color, texture, pattern," she added. "We might put a linear Tibetan with soft blue/grays next to a navy Heriz. . . . It really is all about the mix. We will also put modern art and contemporary furniture on top of an antique Heriz."
Oriental carpet crash
Reuben, Youda, and Benjamin Tehrani opened their first store in Rosemont in 1980 as the family rebuilt their lives in the United States after the Iranian revolution. Moshe, their father, sold his store and inventory in Iran. But the devalued Iranian currency meant that he came here with very little, Reuben said.
Seeking to connect with mansion-owning Main Liners, the brothers opened a concession inside Eadeh Rug in Wayne, which had opened in 1939. As the business grew, the brothers bought a building near the Wayne Hotel, in 1990. These were the Oriental rug go-go years. Wayne supported several stores.
In the late 1990s, the Tehrani brothers opened the second location in Bryn Mawr, hiring the architect who designed the former Shiraz restaurant in Devon. It looks today like a slice of Arabian Nights across from a Rite Aid.
Everybody was making money until the bottom fell out, along with the global financial system.
"In 2008 suddenly our business dropped very dramatically, like 65 to 70%, you know, our gross sales," Reuben said. "After 2008 we tried to hold on to the business of the two locations, but in 2011, we closed our main Wayne location, but we kept our Bryn Mawr location."
The U.S. economy recovered from the financial shock. But the rug business limped along and the Tehrani brothers did what they could to survive financially, sometimes selling rugs at auction for revenue.
"As a rug enthusiast, I like more of the antique Persian traditional designs rather than these modern [designs]. But if the customer wants modern, we have modern," Reuben said. "The kind of rug you find here is not the kind of rug you find on the Internet. . . . We are a boutique type of operation, but we have outlet prices."
Divine intervention
After about an hour of interview with Youda and Reuben, no customer has entered the store. Reuben gets up and walks around, proudly showing off his stock. Antique rugs hang on the wall.
He climbs the stairs to the second floor, to a room filled with string-tied antique Persian rugs - all discounted. Reuben points to a large rug that he could have sold for $100,000 a decade ago but that has been marked down to $40,000. He admits he would consider $25,000, given the market.
For rugs that would have sold for $6,000, he would now consider $2,500. He also sells smaller rugs for between $500 to $600. "They are the lowest prices ever in the history of the antique Persian rug market," Reuben said.
Youda says he's saddened by the rug decline. He has two children. Benjamin has four children, while Reuben has raised five children.
Reuben said that the brothers close their store on Saturdays to observe the Sabbath and for holidays such as Rosh Hashanah.
"If we were not very religious, we would close the place," he said. "But we also love the business. I don't know anything else to do. People tell me things have changed. But I say: 'Listen, if God wants to help me, he will help me. He has helped me so far.' "

Soaring rents and an unconscionable housing gap

Texto completo: For much of the past two decades, the question of how to resolve America's acute shortage of affordable housing has been strikingly absent from the dominant national discourse.
Even after a trillion dollars in bad mortgages nearly blew up the nation's financial system, presidential candidates in the 2012 and 2016 elections did not release detailed housing plans. The fact that America's urban landscape was undergoing a radical shift -- in which millions of young and middle-class Americans were being priced out of large cities because of runaway housing prices -- was still overshadowed by more immediate concerns, like rising health care costs and the loss of factory jobs.
That changed abruptly over the past year, as the consequences of the nation's affordable housing crisis became too visible to ignore. Rents had jumped so high in some cities that teachers, firefighters and schoolteachers could no longer afford to live near their work. Large homeless camps were sprouting up near the centers of once-affordable cities, from Austin, Texas, to Minneapolis to Seattle. Suddenly, housing was on the national agenda.
Anyone seeking a political remedy to the housing problem would do well to read Conor Dougherty's "Golden Gates: The Fight for Housing -- and Democracy -- In America's Most Prosperous City," a painstakingly researched and penetrating analysis of the economic and political forces behind America's most dysfunctional housing market: San Francisco. Dougherty traces the dire scarcity of affordable housing to warped policies dating back to World War II, as well as to exclusionist ordinances closely intertwined with America's obsession with single-family homeownership.
Dougherty, an economics reporter at the New York Times, makes a persuasive case that America's affordable housing shortage cannot be explained by market forces alone; rather it is, at its core, a problem of politics and power. A major culprit is the widespread use of exclusionary zoning -- local government ordinances that designate entire communities solely for those who can afford single-family homes, often with minimum lot sizes.
The local restrictions have conspired to limit the supply of housing in large cities -- the very places where jobs and economic opportunity have become increasingly concentrated, Dougherty writes.
The results are soaring rents and an unconscionable housing gap: In America's cities, there are only 37 affordable apartment units for every 100 low-income renters. Between 2011 and 2017, nearly 4 million low-cost units that rent for under $800 a month have vanished from the nation's housing stock, according to an annual report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
These nationwide trends have been magnified in California -- where anti-growth movements and "Not-in-my-backyard" (NIMBY) activism have been a fixture of the political landscape since the 1970s. But Dougherty avoids the tendency, common in books about economic hardship, to portray people as passive victims of forces beyond their control. Instead, he provides us with richly layered portraits of people seeking, in different ways, to correct the injustices caused by ruthless speculation and exclusionary housing policies. They include a young math teacher so frustrated by sky-high rents that she builds a national movement of pro-housing agitators, known as YIMBY (Yes-in-my-backyard); a Catholic nun who battles real estate speculators; and a city manager who quits his job rather than continue to support exclusionary zoning measures.
Dougherty does not shy away from the complexity of his subject matter, and he illuminates the many contradictions of national and local housing policies. Lost in the debate on rent control, for instance, is the recognition that America has long sought to protect homeowners from wild swings in housing prices by subsidizing fixed-rate mortgages. Rent control, he notes, is little more than an attempt by tenants to get the same kind of protections as homeowners.
Ultimately, Dougherty concludes, "There's no way to rectify a housing shortage other than to build housing, and there's no way to take care of people whom the private market won't take care of other than subsidies or rent control, or both. The details are democracy."

Texto completo: Lynn Cohen, an actress best known for playing the plain-spoken housekeeper and nanny Magda in "Sex and the City," has died. She was 86.
A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Cohen had a long and diverse career as a stage, film and television performer. Her dozens of credits ranged from "Nurse Jackie" and "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" to the feature films "Across the Universe" and "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."
In HBO’s "Sex and City," Cohen’s character was employed by attorney Miranda Hobbes, played by Cynthia Nixon. Magda was featured in the television and movie versions of the popular show, which also starred Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall.
* Jimmy Conway, a former Irish international whose club career included stops with Fulham and the Portland Timbers, has died from complications of dementia. He was 73.
Conway, also the first soccer coach at Oregon State, was diagnosed with dementia in 2009 and was hospitalized in recent years. He died away Thursday night.
The Dublin native made 20 appearances for the Irish national team between 1966-77 and scored three goals.
* Charles "Chuckie" O’Brien, a longtime associate of Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa who became a leading suspect in the labor leader’s disappearance and later was portrayed in the Martin Scorsese film "The Irishman," has died.
O’Brien’s stepson, Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith, said in a blog post that O’Brien died Thursday in Boca Raton, Florida, from what appeared to be a heart attack. He was 86.
O’Brien was a constant companion to Hoffa in the decades when the labor leader developed the Teamsters into one of the largest and most powerful unions in the nation from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. After Hoffa’s still-unsolved disappearance in 1975, O’Brien became a leading suspect when the federal government publicly accused him of picking up Hoffa and driving him to his death.
* Clayton Williams, a colorful Texas oilman and philanthropist whose 1990 run for governor was derailed after joking about rape and acknowledging he went a year without paying income taxes, has died. He was 88.
* Indian environmentalist Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, under whose leadership a U.N. climate change panel shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has died after recent heart surgery. He was 79.
He chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change panel from 2002 until he resigned in 2015 after an employee at his research firm accused him of sexual harassment.
* Frederick Koch, who kept a low profile as an arts benefactor rather than joining the family oil business that became Koch Industries, has died, according to The New York Times. He was 86.
Koch was the oldest of four sons of Fred Koch of Wichita, Kansas. His high profile billionaire younger brothers, Charles and David, ran Koch Industries and bankrolled libertarian causes, but Frederick rarely saw them and preferred to live in relative anonymity, according to the Times.
Koch used his share of the family wealth to support a career as a benefactor of the arts and historic preservation.
He amassed extensive collections of rare books, musical manuscripts and fine and decorative arts, including Marie Antoinette’s canopied bed.
* In December 1980, writer A.E. Hotchner mixed up a batch of salad dressing with his Connecticut neighbor — actor Paul Newman — to give away to friends at Christmas. When it proved to be a hit, they decided almost as a lark to go into business, offering the salad dressing as the first product from a company they called Newman’s Own. They designated all of the profits for charitable causes, an amount that has surpassed $500 million since they launched the company in 1982.
A gift for friendship may have been the defining characteristic of Hotchner, who had a long and eclectic career as a lawyer, magazine editor, playwright and the author of more than 20 books. He was 102 when he died Saturday at his home in Westport, Connecticut.
* Alexei Botyan, a veteran of Soviet intelligence hailed for saving the Polish city of Krakow from being blown up by the Nazis during World War II, has died at 103.
Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Botyan as a "legendary intelligence officer" and a "true patriot" in a telegram of condolences.
* Samoa-born Jimmy Peau, who as Jimmy Thunder recorded one of the fastest knockouts in professional boxing with a first-punch victory over American Crawford Grimley, has died. He was 54.
Peau turned professional in 1989, changing his name to Jimmy Thunder and later to Jimmy "The Thunder" Peau. He won a host of minor titles, including the WBF and IBO heavyweight titles, the WBC international heavyweight title, and was the Australian and Australasian heavyweight champion before moving to the United States in 1994.
* Texas oil and ranching heiress Anne Marion, who founded the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, has died. She was 81.
Marion and her husband, John Marion, established the museum in 1997. She served as the chair of the board of trustees until 2016.
* A publicist for Willie Nelson says Paul English, Nelson’s longtime drummer and the inspiration for Nelson’s song "Me and Paul," has died. He was 87.
English joined Nelson’s band, nicknamed the Family, in 1966 and continued with him for most of his long career. English earned a reputation for brandishing a firearm and engaging in offstage scuffles that made him an outlaw sideman as tough as Nelson himself.
Nelson bragged on their escapades in the song, singing "And at the airport in Milwaukee, They refused to let us board the plane at all, They said we looked suspicious, But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul."
* Actress, singer and dancer Paula Kelly, who earned an Emmy Award nomination on the sitcom "Night Court" and co-starred with Chita Rivera and Shirley MacLaine in the film "Sweet Charity," has died. She was 77.
Kelly made her Broadway debut in the 1964 musical "Something More!" directed by Jule Styne and starring Barbara Cook. She later shared the stage with Morgan Freeman on Broadway in "The Dozens." One of her most important roles was Helene in "Sweet Charity," which she played onstage in London and then reprised in Bob Fosse’s feature film debut.
* Joseph Vilsmaier, a German filmmaker whose striking portrayal of the Battle of Stalingrad brought home the horrors of war to a new generation, has died. He was 81.
Vilsmaier’s 1993 film "Stalingrad" painted a grim picture of the fate of a group of Wehrmacht soldiers sent to the eastern front in 1942 to fight what would become a losing battle against the Soviet Army. The monthslong siege of the city, now known as Volgograd, cost the lives of millions of soldiers and civilians and marked a turning point for Nazi Germany in World War II.
* Caroline Flack, a British television presenter who hosted the controversial reality TV show "Love Island," has died at age 40, her family said Saturday.
* Lyle Mays, a jazz keyboardist whose work, chiefly with the Pat Metheny Group, won nearly a dozen Grammy Awards, has died at age 66.
Born in Wausaukee, Wisconsin, Mays’ mother and father played piano and guitar and he played organ as a youngster.
He co-founded the group with guitarist Metheny in the 1970s, where he was a performer, composer and arranger.
* The founder of the South African multi-Grammy-Award-winning music group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Joseph Shabalala, has died at age 78. 0He was globally known for his leadership of the choral group founded in 1964 that shot to world acclaim, collaborating with Paul Simon on the "Graceland" album and many other artists. The haunting, often a cappella singing style known as isicathamiya helped to make Ladysmith Black Mambazo one of South Africa’s most recognized performers on the world stage.
* Dave McCoy, who transformed California’s Mammoth Mountain from a remote Sierra peak into a downhill destination for skiers and snowboarders from around the world, has died at 104.
* Mirella Freni, an Italian soprano whose uncommon elegance and intensity combined with a sumptuous voice and intelligence to enthrall audiences for a half-century, has died at age 84.
* Former major league outfielder Angel Echevarria, who played seven seasons with three different teams, including the Cubs, has died. He was 48.
Drafted in the 17th round by the Colorado Rockies in 1992, Echevarria made his MLB debut on July 15, 1996, for the organization. He also played for the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs.

Texto completo: U.S. Attorney John Durham is reviewing "three important things" in his inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation, according to an appraisal by former Rep. Trey Gowdy.
The South Carolina Republican gave his best-guess assessment of the secretive "investigation into the investigators" Sunday on Fox News, where he is a contributor.
"He's looking at three things. The factual predicate for this Russia investigation. And I'm not talking about the summer of 2016. I'm talking about stuff that happened in late 2015 and early 2016," Gowdy told Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo.
"Remember, the DOJ and the FBI told Paul Ryan and Devin Nunes and myself repeatedly and exclusively that nothing happened before June of 2016. No payments were made, no contacts with the Trump campaign," he added, referring back to his time as a lead GOP investigator in Congress. "I'm sure John Durham is looking to see whether or not that's true."
Two other areas of interest Gowdy pointed out were alleged government surveillance abuses in targeting a member of the Trump 2016 campaign and the January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference.
"He's also looking at the FISA process and misrepresentations made to the FISA court," the former federal prosecutor said. "I think he's also looking at that ICA, that intelligence community assessment, that John Brennan got done towards the end of the Barack Obama tenure, to make sure whether or not that was thoroughly investigated and whether or not all the right information made its way into that ICA."
Durham was assigned to the task by Attorney General William Barr, who said last spring "some of the facts" about the Russia investigation "don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened." Democrats have criticized the review, which transitioned into a criminal investigation in the fall, as politically motivated scheme to undermine the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller and attack President Trump's perceived enemies.
According to a New York Times report last week, Durham is reviewing former CIA Director John Brennan’s analysis of Russian election interference, including scrutiny of the former Obama CIA director’s handling of a secret source said to be close to the Kremlin. The Connecticut prosecutor is also scrutinizing the intelligence community’s interagency turf war over viewing secretive foreign intelligence and the government restricting access to President Barack Obama's emails that were hacked by Russians but obtained by a foreign ally.
Presented with a counterintelligence activity timeline covering late 2015 and early 2016, ensnaring people who would become members of President Trump's campaign, Gowdy said officials have some explaining to do because, he stressed, the Justice Department and FBI repeatedly told lawmakers "nothing happened with respect to the Trump campaign before June of 2016."
"If something did happen, then either the FBI misrepresented facts to us or it wasn't the FBI, it was another agency that was doing it. Both of those are important to know. And John Durham, I hope, is going to be able to answer that question," Gowdy said.

Media silence on voter registration attack deepens our divide

Texto completo: In the hours and days after Gregory Timm plowed his vehicle into a tent of Republican Party volunteers registering voters in the parking lot of Kernan Village Shopping Center in Jacksonville, Florida, national coverage of the event has been alarmingly lacking.
Local news channel WJXT reported days later on the arrest report, which showed Timm telling the sheriff’s office his “disapproval of Trump” was the motivating factor for the attack. He showed the sheriff's office a self-recorded video of him driving straight at the volunteers, expressing frustration that the video cut out before “the good part.” Even then, as I write this, the best the New York Times could muster was wire coverage.
No teams of reporters were sent to uncover his dark motivations, upbringing, or political leanings. No psychological profiles have been written up, nor have any experts weighed in on how this is a growing threat. These are all tools that would have been used by an army of reporters if Timm had been a Trump supporter plowing into Democratic Party volunteers registering voters.
The problem isn't that Timm's attack on the GOP wasn't covered by most of the media. It's that it wasn't covered with the same voracious appetite news organizations have whenever someone who is even peripherally associated with the Right does something to a Democrat.
This isn’t whataboutism; this is realism. It gets to the heart of why people, especially conservatives, believe the media doesn’t just have a liberal bias, but it either doesn’t cover stories that show when conservatives are attacked, or it buries them.
Jeryl Bier, a freelance writer whose dispatches can be found in the Wall Street Journal and National Review, says no journalist can approach the news completely disinterested. “But I find that many reporters and journalists who either present themselves as nonpartisan or nonideological or seem to think they are or that they overcome it in their reporting just can't really seem to do it,” he said.
In the odd case of the feeble coverage of the attack on the Republican volunteers, Bier says story selection is clearly a problem, and it is something he has taken to social media to amplify repeatedly.
Tweet
Bier was also struck by the irony that at the same time he was pointing out on Twitter that the New York Times was literally ignoring the attack, its national editor Marc Lacey tweeted there was “a bounty of fabulous new jobs on the [New York Times national] staff, all aimed at deepening our coverage of the country. All of them will be based outside of NY and DC.”
Tweet
“I thought it was quite ironic and telling,” Bier said, adding that it may be a sure sign the newspaper understands that it hasn’t gotten the middle of the country for a very long time.
It’s one thing to have a reporter parachute in to cover an event. It is another to have him emotionally embedded and wedded to the community he is covering.
One of the many layers of the story untold about the Timm attack was that his intent likely was meant to strike fear in people wanting to do anything that would associate them with the president in public, including getting involved in helping him get reelected.
Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said in an interview that the reaction had been the opposite at the Duval County Republican Party headquarters, where the volunteers who were attacked came from. “The chair of the Duval GOP, Dean Black, said not only has interest in volunteering picked way up since the incident, a bunch of Democrats came into the office to personally renounce what happened,” he said.
It should come as no shock, particularly if you're conservative or independent, that when it comes to trust in the media, people are sharply divided.
According to a new Pew Research Center study, more Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents trust rather than distrust most of the 30 outlets in the study, which includes the New York Times. The reverse is true among Republicans and center-right independents. In fact, the gap has widened substantially for Republicans' trust in the media in the past six years to get the story right, or without bias, or report it at all.
Bier says the danger for right-leaning news organizations is to try not to overcompensate for what they see as left-wing bias. “It is truly difficult to walk the line, but more in media need to strive for that balance.”
One of the more common observations I hear from people on how my profession reports on politics in this country centers on how Trump has been covered since he became president.
The conversation typically goes something like this: "I don’t mind that you scrutinize every move he makes or what his motivations are, that is your job. I just want to know why you didn’t cover the last guy with the same gusto, which was also your job."
It is fair to say that logic should also apply to how incidents are covered that affect Republicans. There would have been a week's worth of cable news coverage, several nationwide protests, and someone calling for a national conversation by now had the victims of Timm's attack been supporting anyone but Trump.

Prosecutor John Durham examining interagency turf war over Obama emails hacked by Russia: Report

Texto completo: Federal prosecutor John Durham is scrutinizing the intelligence community’s interagency turf war over viewing secretive foreign intelligence and the government restricting access to President Barack Obama's emails that were hacked by Russians but obtained by a foreign ally, sources claimed.
Durham, selected by Attorney General William Barr last year to lead the Justice Department’s inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the U.S. government in dealing with the Kremlin’s interference, apparently is focused on at least two clashes over sensitive information, according to sources cited by the New York Times.
The first internal Obama administration squabble, described by the article in vague terms, related to restrictions placed upon yet-unknown foreign intelligence by one intelligence agency, speculated to be the CIA directed by John Brennan. Other agencies, speculated to include the National Security Agency, wanted access to the material. One source suggested that the CIA wanted to mask American identities in the data set before allowing the NSA to view it.
The second squabble was about the White House preventing the FBI from viewing U.S. emails hacked by the Russians but obtained, copied, and given to the United States by an unnamed foreign intelligence service. The Russians had hacked the Obama White House and State Department — as well as Congress — in 2014, and the FBI wanted to examine the reproduced emails to understand the Russian active measures campaign in 2016.

“But an index of the messages compiled by the unnamed foreign ally showed that they included emails from President Barack Obama as well as members of Congress,” the New York Times reported. “Mr. Obama’s White House counsel, W. Neil Eggleston, decided that investigators should not open the drives, citing executive privilege and the possibility of a separation-of-powers uproar if the FBI sifted through lawmakers’ private messages.”
“The analysts could have been engaged in standard bureaucratic behavior like obeying the filtering process or hoarding sensitive information. Or perhaps they were trying to cover something up,” the New York Times wrote.
The hack was carried out by a Russian group known as Cozy Bear — the same group that analysts believe hacked the Democratic National Committee as well.

The Washington Post reported in 2017 that “the NSA was alerted to the compromises by a Western intelligence agency” and that “the ally had managed to hack not only the Russians’ computers, but also the surveillance cameras inside their workspace, according to the former officials.” The officials said the foreign ally “monitored the hackers as they maneuvered inside the U.S. systems and as they walked in and out of the workspace, and were able to see faces.”
The foreign intelligence now being scrutinized by Durham likely came from the Netherlands.
An article by the Telegraph in 2018 detailed how the Dutch “penetrated the systems of the Russian cyber unit known as Cozy Bear in mid-2014 and monitored them for at least a year” and “informed the CIA and helped remove Cozy Bear from U.S. State Department computers they had hacked into in late 2014” while they “also monitored the Russian hackers as they tried to undermine unclassified computer systems in Congress and the White House.”

A piece by Dutch outlet de Volkskrant claimed in 2018 that Dutch intelligence “became witness to the Russian hackers harassing and penetrating the leaders of the Democratic Party, transferring thousands of emails and documents” and “provided crucial evidence of the Russian involvement in the hacking of the Democratic Party.” The outlet claimed the Dutch information was “also grounds for the FBI to start an investigation into the influence of the Russian interference on the election.”

Durham “asked questions that appear aimed at understanding how analysts reached their conclusion and who drove that process … and whether and how information from foreign governments or the CIA played any role in stoking suspicions at the FBI about Trump campaign links to Russia,” sources cited by the New York Times said.

The Senate Intelligence Committee’s recent report on the Obama administration’s slow response to Russian meddling “found that the U.S. government was not well-postured to counter Russian election interference activity with a full range of readily-available policy options.” The report concluded that Obama’s policymakers “were not concerned with Russian electoral interference directly targeting the United States” until they were told about still-classified information from Brennan and the CIA.

The Senate report’s section on “The U.S. Intelligence Community's Awareness," including when and how the CIA may have first learned about Russia's election interference efforts, is almost entirely redacted.
Durham, who is scrutinizing this as well as Brennan’s other actions in 2016, may wrap up his investigation by the spring or summer.

Texto completo: President Trump attended the wedding of White House adviser Stephen Miller at his hotel in Washington, D.C. in the evening Sunday.
Upon returning from a weekend in Florida, the president's motorcade made the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue to Trump International Hotel, where Miller wed Katie Waldman, press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence.
The White House press pool was informed of Trump's attendance at the private event, but was not immediately informed whether Trump made an address. The president returned to the White House after a couple of hours.
Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus shared a photo of himself and the bride and groom, saying, "Spectacular and very special wedding tonight with new bride and groom Stephen and Katie Miller! So much fun and still going with ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ having fun and the band is going strong!"
Tweet
Earlier in the day Trump attended the Daytona 500, where he flew over the Daytona International Speedway in Air Force One and taking several laps around the track in his presidential limo. NASCAR's season opener was ultimately postponed to Monday due to rain.
Stephen Miller, 34, has been a senior policy adviser to Trump since the beginning of the administration. His is the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda that has been constantly under fire by Democrats. He previously was a communications director to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.
Katie Miller, 28, was spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department during the tenure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen before becoming a press secretary to Pence and special assistant to Trump.
The couple had spoken on the phone for work purposes, but did not meet in-person until 2018 when introduced by mutual friends, according to the New York Times. It was reported they were engaged in November.

Texto completo: Chicago - Strings of lanterns in festive red and gold swayed high above the streets in Chicago’s Chinatown, but few people strolled the sidewalks on a recent afternoon.
At Slurp Slurp Noodles, tourists were not filling the usual tables for lunch, a waitress said. A school crossing guard had stashed a face mask in her pocket, ready to slip it on when her nerves began to fray.
The mysterious coronavirus outbreak has so far largely spared the United States, with only 15 confirmed cases across this country, even as the virus has rapidly spread around the globe and killed more than 1,100 people, most of them in China. Most Americans have gone about their lives, confident that they have little to fear from an epidemic that has mostly been felt abroad.
But for small pockets of people — those who come from China or travel there frequently, and health workers who are charged with battling the virus — life has been upended. Hundreds of Americans who were in China are now marooned in anxious quarantine on military bases. And many Asian Americans in the United States have felt an unnerving public scrutiny, noticing that a simple cough or sneeze can send people around them scattering.
“Instead of ‘Bless you’ or ‘Are you OK,’” said Aretha Deng, 20, a junior at Arizona State University, “their reaction is an instant state of panic.”
Reactions to the coronavirus outbreak have been a study in contrasts. On college campuses, classes and parties continue as usual — except for students returning from China, who have been asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. City leaders in Chicago and New York made a point of visiting those cities’ Chinatowns last week, encouraging visitors to patronize restaurants and shops where business has suffered.
Chicago, home to the nation’s busiest airport, sounded alarm bells last month when a woman contracted the virus after traveling in China and passed it to her spouse, the first person-to-person transmission in the United States. Even after the couple recovered and was discharged from a suburban hospital, signs of worry throughout the city have remained: Travelers at O’Hare International Airport seemed to be wearing more face masks than usual, and in Chinatown, on the city’s South Side, businesses have posted signs forbidding people who have recently visited China to step through the door. (Some Chicagoans have grimly noted on Twitter that an HBO adaptation of “Station Eleven,” a 2014 postapocalyptic novel about a world ravaged by a global flu pandemic, is currently being filmed around the city.)
In San Francisco, recent immigrants from China said they were worrying about the very real health threats for loved ones still there, while encountering the fears of others in their own daily lives in the United States. Yihao Xie, an environmental researcher at a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization, traveled back to the United States from his hometown of Lanzhou, China, early on January 30 — narrowly beating the shutdown of airline travel.
Although Lanzhou is far from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, his co-workers in the United States thought it best for him to stay home from the office for 14 days. He said he understood.
Since then, he took a walk in a nature preserve near his house to calm himself. At the grocery store, he said, he felt the eyes of strangers appraising him.
“A few folks were giving me looks,” he said. “I don’t think they were malicious or hostile, but, ‘Why are you wearing a mask — are you sick?’”
Robert Li, a resident of San Francisco, was browsing phones at a computer store last week when he overheard an employee talking with a customer about the outbreak. “‘Of course, if you eat raw bats, you’re going to get coronavirus,’” he recalled hearing the worker saying.
“They were basically making fun of Asians,” said Li, who is ethnically Chinese. “This is part of a racial trope that Chinese people eat everything.”
Immigration from China was once effectively banned under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first anti-immigrant law directed at a specific nationality.
The Chinese population in the United States began to grow significantly after 1965, when restrictions on immigration were loosened, and it exploded after 1980. At that time, fewer than 500,000 immigrants from China lived in the United States; now there are close to 5 million, primarily concentrated in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose, California, according to the Pew Research Center.
News of the coronavirus outbreak comes on the heels of a trade fight with China that already had created uncertainty and economic worries for some.
“If you are already conditioned to fear China or Chinese people, this gives you another reason,” said Vincent Pan, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a civil rights organization in San Francisco that has called on California agencies to arrange hotlines to collect information on bullying or discrimination related to the virus.
“Disease is a really powerful way to turn one group of people against another group of people,” he said. “Historically, disease has been a really fast way to ‘other-ize’ a community. It’s a tricky balance because we also don’t want as a society to minimize public health concerns.”
Around the nation in recent weeks, health officials have issued warnings that walk a delicate line: trying to protect the public without prompting needless alarm and xenophobia. Since January, local, state and federal health officials have repeated a single message: that the risk of contracting coronavirus in the United States remains low.
“Ethnicity does not influence transmission of the novel coronavirus,” Jeanne Ayers, a Wisconsin health officer, said last week after announcing that a resident in Madison, the capital, had contracted the state’s first case of coronavirus. “It is travel history and direct close contact with a case,” she said, explaining how medical officials believe the person was infected.
So far, the coronavirus outbreak has largely been contained by federal authorities’ decision weeks ago to sharply curtail flights from China and to place the small trickle of travelers who had been there recently into two-week periods of quarantine on military bases or isolation in their homes.
Americans in quarantine said they were ambivalent about their confinement. Some said they were bored and restless, increasingly anxious and lonely, but also understanding of the public’s fears.
Last week Jeffrey Ho, an auto mechanic based in San Bernardino, California, returned from Hubei province, where his wife’s family lives, on a flight organized by the State Department. He and more than 170 fellow passengers from Wuhan are now being held in quarantine on Travis Air Force Base, northeast of San Francisco.
On the one hand, Ho said, he does not blame people for fearing contracting the virus.
When he was in Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, the few people who wandered outside generally kept their distance from one another.
“They are fearing for their lives,” Ho said. “People were suspicious of anyone who left their apartment building.”
On the other hand, he said, fear of the virus in the United States is tinged with racial discrimination. “I feel like I could be potentially targeted, too,” he said.
Last week, Eileen Wong, a business consultant from New York whose parents are from Hong Kong, boarded a packed train in Philadelphia with a colleague and stood in the aisle for the entire 90-minute journey home.
A woman seated nearby looked up from her phone and gasped, Wong said, when the woman spotted Wong and her colleague, who is also Asian American.
“She said, ‘Oh my God!’ and immediately covered herself with her jacket,” Wong said.
Wong’s colleague looked down to see the woman type into Google: “How deadly is coronavirus?”
In a mix of ethnicities in Manhattan, where Wong lives, she never thought of herself as sticking out.
“I grew up here; I don’t have an accent,” Wong said. “You’re American — why would that happen to me?
“It was eye-opening for me,” she said. “We weren’t showing any symptoms like sneezing or coughing, so it was just based on looks.”

Texto completo: Randy Credico is the witness from Robert Mueller’s investigation who Roger Stone, Donald Trump’s longtime adviser, has been convicted of threatening. A few months ago, Credico texted me, “If Stone goes to jail I’m a walking dead man.” On Thursday, after the president’s intervention to get Stone a lighter sentence convulsed the Justice Department, I spoke to Credico, a left-wing comedian and activist, and he elaborated on what he’d meant. “The guy goes to prison and I’m to blame, and you’re being called a rat, you’re worried about somebody with a red hat, a MAGA hat, doing a Jack Ruby on you,” he said.
His fear has national implications, because a central question in the Stone sentencing is whether Credico truly felt endangered when Stone promised to cause him harm. Despite what the administration’s defenders say, the answer is yes.
I’ve known Credico since 2002, although not terribly well. We met when I was reporting on New York’s monstrous Rockefeller drug laws, which put people in prison for 15 years or more for low-level drug offenses. Credico introduced me to people whose lives had been destroyed by these sentences. (The campaign against the Rockefeller laws is also how Credico got to know Stone, a libertarian on drug laws.) Credico told me his father was incarcerated for a decade for cracking safes and came out a badly damaged man, sparking Credico’s lifelong hatred of prison as an institution. He texted me on Wednesday, “I would ask for leniency for Hannibal Lecter.”
It was out of a combination of anxiety and idealism that, following Stone’s conviction, Credico wrote to the judge in the case, asking that she show Stone mercy. “I don’t want to see a guy go to prison because of me, it’s going to be on my conscience, plus it’s going to anger a lot of people out there who called me a rat,” he told me. Now, because of that letter, Credico finds himself near the center of the unfolding scandal over Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr’s intervention in Stone’s sentencing. His words are being used by Trump allies to argue that the prosecutors in the Stone case went overboard. “Unfortunately, they’re exploiting it for their own agenda,” he said of his letter.
As you most likely know by now, in November, Stone was convicted of obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering, all stemming from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. Stone, who members of the Trump campaign saw as an intermediary with WikiLeaks, told Congress, falsely, that Credico was his sole back channel to the hacking organization. Stone threatened Credico not to contradict him, warning him that he’d kidnap Credico’s beloved dog, Bianca, and telling him, “Prepare to die,” with an expletive at the end.
These threats were part of the reason that Justice Department prosecutors originally recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. Trump then tweeted that the proposed sentence was “horrible and very unfair.” After his tweet, Barr overruled career prosecutors to have the DOJ ask the court for a lighter sentence. (Barr claims his decision preceded Trump’s tweet, which might mean he was anticipating Trump’s wishes rather than responding to them.)
Following this unprecedented political meddling, the four main prosecutors on the case withdrew, and one left the Justice Department altogether. On Thursday, in an authoritarian escalation, Trump tweeted an attack on the jury forewoman in the Stone case, singling out a private citizen for abuse because she’d dared to find one of his henchman guilty.
All this represents a terrifying new nadir in the Trump presidency. Under Barr, the Justice Department is becoming a tool of presidential vendettas, protecting people who commit crimes on Trump’s behalf while launching investigations into his enemies, including an inquiry into years-old leaks that appears to be focused on James Comey. Barr has even set up an intake system for Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to feed dirt gathered from Ukraine to the Justice Department, all while Giuliani is himself reportedly under criminal investigation for his shady foreign activities.
On Thursday the attorney general appeared on ABC News to assert his independence, telling Trump to stop tweeting about DOJ cases. But given the slavish way Barr has enacted Trump’s agenda, there’s no reason to see his words as anything but cheap PR meant to quell mounting fury at the way he’s corrupting his agency.
It’s perfectly legitimate to argue that the sentencing guidelines that the original prosecutors relied on in the Stone case are too harsh; America sends too many people to prison for too long. But Barr, in general, does not have a problem with draconian punishments for people who are not personal allies of the president. In August, he lambasted progressive prosecutors, saying they “spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the laws.” In Trump’s America, only a select class of criminals are shown magnanimity. As the former Peruvian president, Óscar Benavides, allegedly said, “For my friends, everything. For my enemies, the law.”
Yet defenders of Trump and Barr are pointing to Credico’s letter to suggest that they were remedying an injustice, rather than perpetrating one. On Fox News, Katie Pavlich claimed that Credico “said that it was actually a joke and they talk about stuff like that all the time and he actually didn’t feel intimidated.” In the DOJ’s updated Stone sentencing memo, Credico’s letter is an important part of the case for a shorter prison term. Credico, the memo said, “asserts that he did not perceive a genuine threat from the defendant but rather stated that ‘I never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog.’”
Note the wording: Stone himself . “I never thought Stone personally was going to do it himself,” Credico told me. Rather, he thought that one of Stone’s supporters might. “I look like the guy that’s gonna be the guy that’s gonna force Stone to talk to the feds and say everything that he knows on the president,” he said. “So I’m expendable at that point. That’s what I’m thinking.”
Now Credico is in the odd position of both hoping that Stone is spared a long prison sentence, and of being horrified about the way the workings of justice are being manipulated on Stone’s behalf. He’s effusive about the upright decency of the four prosecutors — “guys of integrity” — who’ve since withdrawn from the case, saying it was “agonizing” that his letter undermined them. Said Credico, “These guys were career civil servants, and for Trump to be slamming them is an outrage!”
Outrage seems rather too mild a word. There is now one set of laws in this country for people who serve Trump, and another for everyone else. During Trump’s impeachment trial, the House managers repeated a quote attributed to Ben Franklin over and over again: “A republic, if you can keep it.” We haven’t kept it. The question now is whether we ever get it back.

Timothy Egan: California diaspora may turn the tables on Trump

Texto completo: President Donald Trump clearly hates the most populous state in the country he governs. While trashing California with his gutter mouth, the president has used his office to physically trash the home to nearly one in eight Americans — seeking to make its air more polluted, its water less clean, its forests more vulnerable to catastrophic fires.
But now the Golden State is poised to strike back. By moving its presidential primary from June to March 3, California will finally exert a political influence commensurate to its size. Almost 500 delegates, a fourth of the number needed to win the Democratic nomination, are at stake.
Perhaps more consequential — or at least overlooked — is what’s happening among the vast diaspora of more than 7.3 million people who have left California since 2007. They appear to be changing the political makeup of the states they’ve moved to, perhaps enough to alter the Electoral College map in favor of Democrats.
With nearly 40 million people, California is still gaining population — barely. But stratospheric home prices and unbearable rental costs have created a reverse “Grapes of Wrath,” forcing those who are not rich to flee to states with much lower costs of living.
The question is: Are they bringing California values — fierce defense of the environment, tolerance of immigrants and a multiracial society, insistence on universal health care — with them? It could be just demographic churn. But if you look at the changing politics of Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, all fast-growing states packed with new arrivals from California, the answer is yes. Texas may not be far behind.
The most endangered species, California Republicans, make the most noise about how awful the state is. They cite the many thousands sleeping on streets, the failure to enforce basic standards of public behavior, and high taxes. San Francisco, the sad city by the bay, has become a “hostage to the homeless,” as one respected state journal put it.
More than half of Californians say they have considered leaving the state, and a large majority of them are conservatives, as one survey found. But the evidence in the states taking in a majority of ex-Californians — among those who actually leave rather than just whine about leaving — tells another story.
In Nevada, which saw 500,000 Californians move there between 2008 and 2018, Democrats won the governor’s mansion and a second U.S. Senate seat in 2018. There used to be more Republicans, by registration. But Democrats now have a 70,000-voter advantage, and they prevailed there in the last three presidential races.
Colorado, another favorite landing spot for those who can no longer afford California, is now reliably blue. Democrats won majorities there by more than 100,000 votes in the last two presidential elections. The state is likely to flip a Senate seat, bouncing the inept Republican Cory Gardner for a popular former governor, John Hickenlooper.
Arizona could be the next to fall to Democrats. The state known for retirees and tax-averse whites is becoming more diverse and younger and is full of ex-Californians. Between 2001 and 2014, Arizona added about a quarter-million people from its neighboring state to the west.
Trump won Arizona by 91,000 votes. But in 2018, quirky Kyrsten Sinema became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat since 1988, with a victory margin of about 56,000 votes.
Looking at this year’s electoral map, Arizona is a wild card. I’ve long believed that it’s better to win back the 80,000 votes that proved to be the winning margin for Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan than to grow another two million progressives on the coasts.
But if the Dems were to win Arizona’s 11 Electoral College votes, as polls show they could, and lose Wisconsin’s 10, while getting back Pennsylvania and Michigan, that would be enough to remove the vile and corrupt man occupying the White House.
Texas, the top state for California exiles, will probably come up short for Democrats this year, though it’s in play. Democrats have a growing advantage in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, all seeing heavy U-Haul traffic from California.
Polls in Texas show Trump failing to get above 48% in matchups with Democrats. And 45% of voters wanted to impeach and remove him from office.
Bullying and berating California is good politics for Trump. The rest of the country has little sympathy for the “sunbaked barbarians,” as an old friend in Seattle used to call them. As someone who grew up loathing the hordes who moved north to my native Pacific Northwest, I get it.
But Trump treats these fellow citizens as aliens. He’s going out of his way to gut the state’s clean air standards, to turn the Eden of its public lands over to industrial pillagers and to cast its immigrant strivers as criminals. He has done nothing — rebuffing the state’s plea for additional housing vouchers for the poor — to mitigate the homeless crisis. He’d prefer a dystopia on the Pacific, largely because he lost the Golden State by more than 4 million votes.
And yet Californians, those who still proudly call it home and those who left their hearts there, could be the force that sends him packing.

Texto completo: Idris Goodwin is many things: poet, playwright, hip-hop artist, theater director, educator.
And now he’s one more: director of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College.
The former CC assistant professor of theater started last week in the new position on a part-time basis and will officially take over May 1, relieving the duties of FAC director Erin Hannan, who announced her departure in November.
“What I’m interested in is galvanizing a conversation and bringing different people together in the arts,” says Goodwin. “I’m into creative community building. This job is a platform to do that in exciting ways. The FAC is this historic venue. Its founders wanted the Front Range to have really dynamic art that was available to everyone. The West is an interesting place that has so many stories people don’t know. There’s a great opportunity to tell the story of our part of the country. The campus can not only serve the city, but can speak to the whole world.”
From 2012 to 2018, Goodwin taught playwriting, hip-hop aesthetics, spoken word writing and more in the CC Department of Theatre and Dance. From there, he left town and became the producing artistic director of StageOne Family Theatre in Louisville, Ky.
Goodwin rose to the top of the candidate pool during a time of transition for the FAC. It was announced in 2016 that the nonprofit institution would be fully integrated into CC by July 1. Whoever was named director would need the experience and ability to engage on the academic side with the college and also maintain and grow the community side of the organization.
“It was a tough call. We’re asking someone to fill a bunch of shoes,” says CC Provost Alan Townsend. “We’re excited he’s interested in coming back. He’s a really remarkable person in a number of ways. He’s an influential artist. He’s got a big vision, great connections and community ties here.”
Goodwin’s work is produced across the country and has been recognized by the National Endowment for the Arts, The New York Times, National Public Radio and others. He’s performed his poetry on HBO’s “Def Poetry Jam” and PBS’ “Sesame Street,” and written award-winning plays, including “And in This Corner... Cassius Clay,” which received the 2017 Distinguished Play Award from The American Association of Theater and Education. Last year, TheatreWorks produced his new show, “American Prom.”
Several books of his poetry and essays also have been published, including the 2011 “These are the Breaks,” which was nominated for a Pushcart Prize.
While Goodwin will always have a national career, he says, making sure others flourish is also important to him.
“Being a director is about others shining, others succeeding, helping to bring everyone’s game up,” he says. “If our space is vibrant and exciting and representative of the region, and they’re coming through our space and talking about it and tweeting about it in the streets, and we’re seeing the impact over a long period of time, that means to me we’re doing our job. That’s what I’m after. That to me is success.”

Texto completo: A Gorham woman is stranded in Cambodia after another passenger who disembarked from her cruise ship tested positive for the new coronavirus that has sickened tens of thousands in China and others elsewhere around the world.
It’s the latest twist in the odyssey of Opal Staudenmaier, who embarked on a Pacific cruise in January and, as the outbreak swept through Asia, found her ship, the MS Westerdam, barred from port after port. Manila, Kaoshiung, Taiwan, and Ishigaki, Japan, all turned the 951-foot Dutch cruise liner away, fearing infection from passengers who boarded in Hong Kong.
The cruise was eventually canceled on Feb. 7, but the ordeal is far from over.
After finally being allowed to disembark this past Thursday in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, passengers of the Westerdam were informed this weekend that they couldn’t fly home after all. An 82-year-old American woman from the ship had tested positive for the coronavirus, twice, after flying with more than a hundred other passengers to Malaysia, The New York Times reported.
As a result, Staudenmaier and many other passengers have been confined to their rooms at a hotel in Phnom Penh, the country’s capital, as they endure round after round of tests.
“This is a lot less tolerable than being ‘stranded’ on a luxury cruise ship,” Staudenmaier, a 48-year-old software developer at Idexx Laboratories, wrote in an email Saturday.
“Coronavirus” is the name of a family of diseases that typically affect the respiratory system. The latest outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has spread to 68,500 people in mainland China and others across the globe. The death toll in China reached 1,665 on Sunday.
Cambodian officials have tested all passengers and crew members who had fever or flu-like symptoms since leaving Hong Kong on Feb. 1., Staudenmaier said. Staudenmaier herself had caught a cold recently, but said she had tested negative for the coronavirus.
The Westerdam initially received a warm welcome in Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Sen greeted disembarking passengers in person last week, and the cruise line, Holland America, was able to charter flights to get passengers home.
Staudenmaier’s homebound flight had been scheduled for Saturday. She and other passengers took a charter flight from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh, which is more than 100 miles inland, without trouble.
But when they arrived in the capital, she said, “we were greeted with chaos.”
Check-ins dragged on, and little information was available about when the flight would actually depart. Then came the announcement of a positive coronavirus test, accompanied by news that the flight was delayed – and then canceled. Other flights chartered by Holland America were not allowed to land.
Cruise line officials distributed letters to passengers in Phnom Penh on Sunday informing them that travel plans were, for now, up in the air.
“It will be impossible for us to plan any travel arrangement from Phnom Penh today for you to complete your homeward journey,” said a copy of the letter provided by Staudenmaier.
Phnom Penh is 12 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast, and tests were scheduled to begin again on Monday morning, Cambodia time.

Desmienten liberación del Rey Zambada y Chapo Diputada por testificar vs el Chapo Guzmán

Texto completo: El narcotraficante Jesús “ el Rey ” Zambada así como Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez, exlegisladora mexicana conocida como la Chapo Diputada no han sido liberados como se informó recientemente en diferentes medios.
“Para quedar libres la orden tendría que venir de un juez federal y de nadie más”, explicó un funcionario del Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos citado anónimamente para el semanario mexicano Proceso, al referirse también a Jorge Cifuentes, narcotraficante colombiano que ayudó al Chapo a trasladar cocaína desde Ecuador.

“Los tres o están bajo la custodia de los US Marshalls (alguaciles federales) o en el programa de testigos protegidos” y es por ello que sus nombres ya no aparecen como si estuvieran bajo la tutela del Buró Federal de Prisiones (BOP, por sus siglas en inglés) de los Estados Unidos.
Lo que explica el por qué el reportero de The New York Times, Alan Feuer , quien ironizó sobre los beneficios que habría obtenido el Rey Zambada tras participar como testigo protegido en el juicio en contra de Joaquín “ el Chapo ” Guzmán .
Cuando el BOP publica que ya no tiene bajo su custodia a un reo, hay dos explicaciones a decir de la fuente de Proceso:
“La primera, es que el reo está en poder de los alguaciles porque lo están llevando a juicios o a su juicio (y para ello tiene que salir de prisión, ya sea a testificar o estar frente al juez de su caso) y la segunda, puede ser que ya ingresó a un programa de testigos protegidos”.
E insistió que “para ambas situaciones, la liberación debe ser dictaminada por un juez federal, el Buró Federal de Prisiones no tiene la potestad de liberar a nadie, para eso existe el poder judicial” según la explicación.
Además puso como ejemplo la vez que el Chapo Guzmán estaba siendo enjuiciado cuando la página oficial del BOP dio cuenta de que había sido liberado y ya no estaba bajo su responsabilidad si no en manos de los alguaciles federales que se hacían cargo de los traslados a la corte y a una cárcel estatal donde se quedaba cuando no había audiencia de su juicio.

¿Por qué es preocupante el envío de fuerzas especiales para ayudar a ICE en ciudades santuario?

Texto completo: El despliegue de fuerzas especiales que la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza ( CBP ) hará en al menos 11 grandes ciudades, para ayudar a oficiales de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) a detener indocumentados, preocupa a activistas y defensores de inmigrantes, ya que en esas zonas es donde se concentra el mayor número de extranjeros sin documentos para residir en el país.
De los 11 millones de indocumentados que viven en los Estados Unidos, alrededor de 6.8 millones se concentran en 20 zonas metropolinas , lideradas por Nueva York-Newark-New Jersey y Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim.
Por separado, las estimaciones de las tres ciudades donde hay más indocumentados son: Nueva York, con 525,000; Los Ángeles 375,000; Chicago con 140,000, según el Pew Research Center.
Según The New York Times, dos funcionarios que conocen el operativo secreto, señalaron que los agentes especiales serán enviados primero a Nueva York y Chicago, pero después a San Francisco , Los Ángeles , Atlanta , Houston , Boston , Nueva Orleans , Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey).
Varios grupos de activistas rechazaron frontalmente la nueva acción contra inmigrantes del gobierno de Donald Trump , porque dicen que eso le está haciendo para ganar votos de cara a las próximas elecciones presidenciales.
“No es ninguna sorpresa que esté sucediendo en este momento” , dijo en una conferencia de prensa telefónica la presidenta de la organización “Community Change Action”, Lorella Praeli.
“(Trump) Está viendo que va a perder el poder en noviembre”, agregó Praeli en referencia a la fecha de los comicios. “Está tratando de movilizar a sus seguidores” .
Por su parte, el director ejecutivo de “America’s Voice”, Frank Sharry , tildó las acciones de la administración estadounidense de “explosivas y manipuladoras”, y opinó que se trata de “una estrategia para distraer de los terribles resultados” de su gobierno.
“(Trump) No habla de salud, no habla de educación, ni de la crisis climática, ni de la violencia con armas” , dijo Sharry, quien señaló que la actual administración ha llevado a cabo “esfuerzos coordinados desde el primer día para atacar a los inmigrantes” en EEUU.
“Si Trump, Dios no lo quiera, es reelegido, vamos a ver una expansión y una aceleración de las tácticas de la Policía federal” , vaticinó.
Sin embargo, indicaron los activistas, le está “saliendo el tiro por la culata” a Trump, ya que los ataques a la población inmigrante, dicen, no han hecho más que aumentar el apoyo a los indocumentados, mientras que los gobiernos locales de ciertas ciudades se han negado a cooperar con la administración central.
“Lo que ha hecho ha sido causar unidad entre aquellos que dicen que quieren que los refugiados vengan a este país” , insistió.
Además, esta decisión del Gobierno de Trump va a suponer “una razón más por la que los gobiernos locales no querrán colaborar con ICE” , dijo por su parte la representante de la Unión Americana de Libertades Civiles ( ACLU ), Naureen Shah.
La decisión de la Administración Trump es el último movimiento en su batalla contra las llamadas “ciudades santuario” , lugares donde las autoridades locales se niegan a cooperar con las autoridades federales para encontrar y deportar a indocumentados.
Un portavoz de la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza ( CBP ) confirmó al Times que la agencia va a desplegar 100 agentes para trabajar con ICE, la agencia que se encarga de capturar a inmigrantes dentro del país para su deportación.
El despliegue tendrá lugar desde febrero a mayo, según un correo electrónico interno visto por el periódico, que señala que entre los agentes habrá miembros de un grupo especial de la Patrulla Fronteriza conocido como BORTAC.
Esas unidades tácticas, que operan en la frontera sur, se utilizan habitualmente en operaciones de alto riesgo contra individuos violentos y grupos criminales y del narcotráfico.

“No es ninguna sorpresa que esté sucediendo en este momento” , dijo en una conferencia de prensa telefónica la presidenta de la organización “Community Change Action”, Lorella Praeli.
“(Trump) Está viendo que va a perder el poder en noviembre”, agregó Praeli en referencia a la fecha de los comicios. “Está tratando de movilizar a sus seguidores” .
Por su parte, el director ejecutivo de “America’s Voice”, Frank Sharry , tildó las acciones de la administración estadounidense de “explosivas y manipuladoras”, y opinó que se trata de “una estrategia para distraer de los terribles resultados” de su gobierno.
“(Trump) No habla de salud, no habla de educación, ni de la crisis climática, ni de la violencia con armas” , dijo Sharry, quien señaló que la actual administración ha llevado a cabo “esfuerzos coordinados desde el primer día para atacar a los inmigrantes” en EEUU.
“Si Trump, Dios no lo quiera, es reelegido, vamos a ver una expansión y una aceleración de las tácticas de la Policía federal” , vaticinó.
Sin embargo, indicaron los activistas, le está “saliendo el tiro por la culata” a Trump, ya que los ataques a la población inmigrante, dicen, no han hecho más que aumentar el apoyo a los indocumentados, mientras que los gobiernos locales de ciertas ciudades se han negado a cooperar con la administración central.
“Lo que ha hecho ha sido causar unidad entre aquellos que dicen que quieren que los refugiados vengan a este país” , insistió.
Además, esta decisión del Gobierno de Trump va a suponer “una razón más por la que los gobiernos locales no querrán colaborar con ICE” , dijo por su parte la representante de la Unión Americana de Libertades Civiles ( ACLU ), Naureen Shah.
La decisión de la Administración Trump es el último movimiento en su batalla contra las llamadas “ciudades santuario” , lugares donde las autoridades locales se niegan a cooperar con las autoridades federales para encontrar y deportar a indocumentados.
Un portavoz de la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza ( CBP ) confirmó al Times que la agencia va a desplegar 100 agentes para trabajar con ICE, la agencia que se encarga de capturar a inmigrantes dentro del país para su deportación.
El despliegue tendrá lugar desde febrero a mayo, según un correo electrónico interno visto por el periódico, que señala que entre los agentes habrá miembros de un grupo especial de la Patrulla Fronteriza conocido como BORTAC.
Esas unidades tácticas, que operan en la frontera sur, se utilizan habitualmente en operaciones de alto riesgo contra individuos violentos y grupos criminales y del narcotráfico.

Texto completo: Danny Atehortua dice que a su esposa siempre le ha gustado cocinar y hacer las arepas típicas del país del que son ambos, Colombia. Ella, Shirley Atehortua, cocinaba para conocidos desde hace tiempo, pero en 2013 decidieron llevar sus productos a los festivales de las calles y probar si había un negocio en ello.
Fue un buen paso que consolidaron al poco tiempo en un nuevo mercado que se lanzó hace seis años, el Queens Night Market o Mercado Nocturno de Queens, un lugar abierto de abril a octubre en Flushing Meadows Corona Park los sábados. “La experiencia en el mercado fue muy buena y nos dimos a conocer a gente de toda la ciudad”, explica Atehortua.
Tanto es así que este matrimonio ha pasado de tomar parte en este muestrario culinario a dar el paso hacia los negocios. Hace dos años abrieron un restaurante, Arepalicious en Ozone Park, en el que ya trabajan 10 personas.
Danny Atehortua trabaja para la ciudad y no tenía experiencia como empresario. “Abrir el restaurante, participar en el mercado y el curso que la SBS (Small Business Services de NYC) hace con John han sido mi escuela”, explica.
John es John Wang, el creador del Queens Night Market, un hombre con títulos en negocios y leyes en la Universidad de Yale y que dejó su trabajo en el mundo corporativo para tratar de poner en marcha en Nueva York algo que había visto en Taiwan (de donde es su familia) y en el resto de Asia, un mercado nocturno. Los hay en otras ciudades de EEUU pero en Nueva York, una urbe en la que hay tanta diversidad como creatividad, curiosamente faltaba este tipo de evento.
Hasta que Wang se empeñó en ponerlo en marcha.
El objetivo es dar a conocer la comida tradicional de distintas partes del mundo que no sea fácil encontrar en la ciudad pero que sea con la que han crecido los participantes de este mercado. La oferta comienza antes de la caída de la noche (a las 5.00 pm) y la otra condición es que los precios sean asequibles. El mercado impuso un tope de precios hace un año para que cada platillo costar un máximo de $5 y solo recientemente debido a los aumentos de costos se permite que algunos se vendan a $6.
Este año ya tiene para las 60 plazas de comida 300 solicitudes de distintas cocinas neoyorquinas con raíces en distintas esquinas del planeta, desde Bolivia hasta el Tibet pasando por Polonia, Portugal o Filipinas. “Mucha gente participa por hacer algo diferente, por divertirse, por compartir pero no necesariamente son personas que tienen un negocio o lo quieran”, dice Wang de quienes solicitan hacer y vender la comida.
Para los que lo quieren o necesitan una orientación, el mercado, en asociación con el SBS y el Queens Economic Development Corporation hacen seminarios para los aspirantes a establecerse en el parque. “Primeros pasos y creación de una idea de negocio que funcione”, es este año el tema de la primera de las sesiones que empieza esta misma semana (18 de febrero) para los 70 participantes que ya han reservado su espacio para 2020.
Imagen de marca, eficiencia operacional, mercadotecnia y manejo de medios sociales son algunos de los temas que se cubren en estos seminarios para unos participantes que según el comisionado del SBS, Gregg Bishop, “son la imagen de la diversidad de negocios en la ciudad”. “Con esta asociación estamos facilitando seminarios para los aspirantes a empresarios y los futuros vendedores para que lancen sus negocios”, explica Bishop en un comunicado.
Como en el casi de los dueños de Arepadelicious hay vendedores que están establecidos pero Wang no quiere alimentar las expectativas de dinero de ninguno de los participantes. “Mi papel es mantenerme escéptico”, dice explicando que le gusta ser conservador y tener un punto de pesimismo. “Es muy duro para ellos, no pueden esperar hacerse ricos, de hecho muchos de ellos no están como negocio en el sector de las comidas”.
Wang dice que es conveniente moderar las expectativas y “tener proyecciones realistas”. “Calculo que solo el 10% de los participantes tiene un negocio asentado”, dice.
“Si van a hacerlo, que sea por amor”, dice con humor. “Mucha gente viene aquí a hacer algo diferente, para divertirse, no solo para hacer negocios”. En ese sentido cree que hay una buena onda en el mercado por la falta de presión. “Es único, todo el mudo está contento y sonríe”, explica.
Para el propio Wang echar a rodar el mercado fue duro los primeros años pero ha conseguido asentarlo y tener unos 300,000 visitantes el año pasado. “Como media vienen 13,000 personas y cuando el tiempo es bueno hay noches en las que se juntan hasta 20,000” . Desde que empezó el mercado, que no puede aumentar la oferta debido al espacio físico que hay, han visto representada su cocina unos 90 países.
De hecho, Atehortua explica que una vez que se comunicó con Wang para el primer mercado registró la empresa y han estado casi todos los años en el mercado menos el que abrió su restaurante. “Estamos muy agradecidos al mercado porque es allí donde el inversionista que nos ayudó nos dio la oportunidad”, explica Atehortua.
“Le conocíamos pero hasta entonces nunca habíamos hablado de negocios”, dicen de esta persona que les prestó el dinero para sacar adelante su empresa. Era una idea que tenían para el futuro, abrir su restaurante, “pero el futuro se adelantó”
No obstante, Atehortua coincide con Wang en que hay que mantener bajas las expectativas. “Uno tiene que tener sus metas, los primeros años no nos fue muy bien, ni a él ni a nosotros pero ahora ya la cosa ha cambiado. Lo importante es tener metas, un buen producto y que las cosas no se hagan por dinero sino por pasión y por querer hacerlo bien”.
Entre los negocios que están asentados Bolivian Llama Party participará por primera vez en el Queens Night Market.
David Oropeza es uno de los tres hermanos que abrieron este negocio hace tres años en el TurnStyle Foodcourt de Columbus Circle en Manhattan y ahora tienen otro más en Brooklyn.
Ellos empezaron en los mercados-festivales en las calles como el Smorgasburg antes de establecerse como negocio aunque su llegada a este tiene un punto de casual. Tal y como describe Oropeza, cuyos padres son bolivianos, vender comida era la manera “de pagar los instrumentos de una banda a la que pertenecíamos, necesitábamos el dinero para grabar un CD”.
Al preguntarle por la banda, Oropeza se ríe y dice que se quedó en el pasado. Los platillos, sobre todo las salteñas, las cholas o las papas tuvieron más éxito que los acordes y cuando tras abrir en Manhattan el New York Times les hizo una buena crítica las cosas les empezaron a ir bien. Están planificando la apertura de otro negocio en Sunnyside Queens.
“Queremos ir al Queens Night Market porque queremos ofrecer comida que todo el mundo pueda probar, a un precio asequible para que se pueda disfrutar en familia”, dice recordando el tope de precios del mercado. “Es importante para nosotros que la gente se lo pueda permitir. “Este año estuvimos en diciembre en el mercado del Citifield, la gente iba y consumía y vimos que era bueno hacer algo que no resultara caro a las familias, que pudieran cenar por $20 y pasarlo bien”.
Justo lo que Wang quiere que ocurra en las noches de Queens.
Un viaje por la comida casera del mundo sin salir de Queens con las historias de sus protagonistas. Esa es la propuesta de un libro del Mercado Nocturno de Queens que saldrá a la venta en abril.
El libro, escrito por John Wang y su esposa Storm Garner, contiene algunas de las recetas de la comida que se ha disfrutado desde que en 2015 diera comienzo el mercado y las historias de algunos de sus vendedores. “La mayor parte de los cocineros son inmigrantes de primera y segunda generación”, dicen sus autores, por lo que traen las historias de sus raíces con ellos. “Las historias son bastante increíbles”, dice con entusiasmo Wang.
El libro estará a la venta en mayo.

Texto completo: El despliegue de fuerzas especiales que la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza ( CBP ) hará en al menos 11 grandes ciudades, para ayudar a oficiales de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) a detener indocumentados, preocupa a activistas y defensores de inmigrantes, ya que en esas zonas es donde se concentra el mayor número de extranjeros sin documentos para residir en el país.
De los 11 millones de indocumentados que viven en los Estados Unidos, alrededor de 6.8 millones se concentran en 20 zonas metropolinas , lideradas por Nueva York-Newark-New Jersey y Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim.
Por separado, las estimaciones de las tres ciudades donde hay más indocumentados son: Nueva York, con 525,000; Los Ángeles 375,000; Chicago con 140,000, según el Pew Research Center.
Según The New York Times, dos funcionarios que conocen el operativo secreto, señalaron que los agentes especiales serán enviados primero a Nueva York y Chicago, pero después a San Francisco , Los Ángeles , Atlanta , Houston , Boston , Nueva Orleans , Detroit y Newark (Nueva Jersey).
Varios grupos de activistas rechazaron frontalmente la nueva acción contra inmigrantes del gobierno de Donald Trump , porque dicen que eso le está haciendo para ganar votos de cara a las próximas elecciones presidenciales.

Texto completo: El narcotraficante Jesús “ el Rey ” Zambada así como Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez, exlegisladora mexicana conocida como la Chapo Diputada no han sido liberados como se informó recientemente en diferentes medios.
“Para quedar libres la orden tendría que venir de un juez federal y de nadie más”, explicó un funcionario del Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos citado anónimamente para el semanario mexicano Proceso, al referirse también a Jorge Cifuentes, narcotraficante colombiano que ayudó al Chapo a trasladar cocaína desde Ecuador.

“Los tres o están bajo la custodia de los US Marshalls (alguaciles federales) o en el programa de testigos protegidos” y es por ello que sus nombres ya no aparecen como si estuvieran bajo la tutela del Buró Federal de Prisiones (BOP, por sus siglas en inglés) de los Estados Unidos.
Lo que explica el por qué el reportero de The New York Times, Alan Feuer , quien ironizó sobre los beneficios que habría obtenido el Rey Zambada tras participar como testigo protegido en el juicio en contra de Joaquín “ el Chapo ” Guzmán .
Cuando el BOP publica que ya no tiene bajo su custodia a un reo, hay dos explicaciones a decir de la fuente de Proceso:
“La primera, es que el reo está en poder de los alguaciles porque lo están llevando a juicios o a su juicio (y para ello tiene que salir de prisión, ya sea a testificar o estar frente al juez de su caso) y la segunda, puede ser que ya ingresó a un programa de testigos protegidos”.
E insistió que “para ambas situaciones, la liberación debe ser dictaminada por un juez federal, el Buró Federal de Prisiones no tiene la potestad de liberar a nadie, para eso existe el poder judicial” según la explicación.
Además puso como ejemplo la vez que el Chapo Guzmán estaba siendo enjuiciado cuando la página oficial del BOP dio cuenta de que había sido liberado y ya no estaba bajo su responsabilidad si no en manos de los alguaciles federales que se hacían cargo de los traslados a la corte y a una cárcel estatal donde se quedaba cuando no había audiencia de su juicio.

Este año ya tiene para las 60 plazas de comida 300 solicitudes de distintas cocinas neoyorquinas con raíces en distintas esquinas del planeta, desde Bolivia hasta el Tibet pasando por Polonia, Portugal o Filipinas. “Mucha gente participa por hacer algo diferente, por divertirse, por compartir pero no necesariamente son personas que tienen un negocio o lo quieran”, dice Wang de quienes solicitan hacer y vender la comida.
Para los que lo quieren o necesitan una orientación, el mercado, en asociación con el SBS y el Queens Economic Development Corporation hacen seminarios para los aspirantes a establecerse en el parque. “Primeros pasos y creación de una idea de negocio que funcione”, es este año el tema de la primera de las sesiones que empieza esta misma semana (18 de febrero) para los 70 participantes que ya han reservado su espacio para 2020.
Imagen de marca, eficiencia operacional, mercadotecnia y manejo de medios sociales son algunos de los temas que se cubren en estos seminarios para unos participantes que según el comisionado del SBS, Gregg Bishop, “son la imagen de la diversidad de negocios en la ciudad”. “Con esta asociación estamos facilitando seminarios para los aspirantes a empresarios y los futuros vendedores para que lancen sus negocios”, explica Bishop en un comunicado.
Como en el casi de los dueños de Arepadelicious hay vendedores que están establecidos pero Wang no quiere alimentar las expectativas de dinero de ninguno de los participantes. “Mi papel es mantenerme escéptico”, dice explicando que le gusta ser conservador y tener un punto de pesimismo. “Es muy duro para ellos, no pueden esperar hacerse ricos, de hecho muchos de ellos no están como negocio en el sector de las comidas”.
Wang dice que es conveniente moderar las expectativas y “tener proyecciones realistas”. “Calculo que solo el 10% de los participantes tiene un negocio asentado”, dice.
“Si van a hacerlo, que sea por amor”, dice con humor. “Mucha gente viene aquí a hacer algo diferente, para divertirse, no solo para hacer negocios”. En ese sentido cree que hay una buena onda en el mercado por la falta de presión. “Es único, todo el mudo está contento y sonríe”, explica.
Para el propio Wang echar a rodar el mercado fue duro los primeros años pero ha conseguido asentarlo y tener unos 300,000 visitantes el año pasado. “Como media vienen 13,000 personas y cuando el tiempo es bueno hay noches en las que se juntan hasta 20,000” . Desde que empezó el mercado, que no puede aumentar la oferta debido al espacio físico que hay, han visto representada su cocina unos 90 países.
De hecho, Atehortua explica que una vez que se comunicó con Wang para el primer mercado registró la empresa y han estado casi todos los años en el mercado menos el que abrió su restaurante. “Estamos muy agradecidos al mercado porque es allí donde el inversionista que nos ayudó nos dio la oportunidad”, explica Atehortua.
“Le conocíamos pero hasta entonces nunca habíamos hablado de negocios”, dicen de esta persona que les prestó el dinero para sacar adelante su empresa. Era una idea que tenían para el futuro, abrir su restaurante, “pero el futuro se adelantó”
No obstante, Atehortua coincide con Wang en que hay que mantener bajas las expectativas. “Uno tiene que tener sus metas, los primeros años no nos fue muy bien, ni a él ni a nosotros pero ahora ya la cosa ha cambiado. Lo importante es tener metas, un buen producto y que las cosas no se hagan por dinero sino por pasión y por querer hacerlo bien”.
Entre los negocios que están asentados Bolivian Llama Party participará por primera vez en el Queens Night Market.
David Oropeza es uno de los tres hermanos que abrieron este negocio hace tres años en el TurnStyle Foodcourt de Columbus Circle en Manhattan y ahora tienen otro más en Brooklyn.
Ellos empezaron en los mercados-festivales en las calles como el Smorgasburg antes de establecerse como negocio aunque su llegada a este tiene un punto de casual. Tal y como describe Oropeza, cuyos padres son bolivianos, vender comida era la manera “de pagar los instrumentos de una banda a la que pertenecíamos, necesitábamos el dinero para grabar un CD”.
Al preguntarle por la banda, Oropeza se ríe y dice que se quedó en el pasado. Los platillos, sobre todo las salteñas, las cholas o las papas tuvieron más éxito que los acordes y cuando tras abrir en Manhattan el New York Times les hizo una buena crítica las cosas les empezaron a ir bien. Están planificando la apertura de otro negocio en Sunnyside Queens.
“Queremos ir al Queens Night Market porque queremos ofrecer comida que todo el mundo pueda probar, a un precio asequible para que se pueda disfrutar en familia”, dice recordando el tope de precios del mercado. “Es importante para nosotros que la gente se lo pueda permitir. “Este año estuvimos en diciembre en el mercado del Citifield, la gente iba y consumía y vimos que era bueno hacer algo que no resultara caro a las familias, que pudieran cenar por $20 y pasarlo bien”.
Justo lo que Wang quiere que ocurra en las noches de Queens.
Un viaje por la comida casera del mundo sin salir de Queens con las historias de sus protagonistas. Esa es la propuesta de un libro del Mercado Nocturno de Queens que saldrá a la venta en abril.
El libro, escrito por John Wang y su esposa Storm Garner, contiene algunas de las recetas de la comida que se ha disfrutado desde que en 2015 diera comienzo el mercado y las historias de algunos de sus vendedores. “La mayor parte de los cocineros son inmigrantes de primera y segunda generación”, dicen sus autores, por lo que traen las historias de sus raíces con ellos. “Las historias son bastante increíbles”, dice con entusiasmo Wang.
El libro estará a la venta en mayo.

Texto completo: Danny Atehortua dice que a su esposa siempre le ha gustado cocinar y hacer las arepas típicas del país del que son ambos, Colombia. Ella, Shirley Atehortua, cocinaba para conocidos desde hace tiempo, pero en 2013 decidieron llevar sus productos a los festivales de las calles y probar si había un negocio en ello.
Fue un buen paso que consolidaron al poco tiempo en un nuevo mercado que se lanzó hace seis años, el Queens Night Market o Mercado Nocturno de Queens, un lugar abierto de abril a octubre en Flushing Meadows Corona Park los sábados. “La experiencia en el mercado fue muy buena y nos dimos a conocer a gente de toda la ciudad”, explica Atehortua.
Tanto es así que este matrimonio ha pasado de tomar parte en este muestrario culinario a dar el paso hacia los negocios. Hace dos años abrieron un restaurante, Arepalicious en Ozone Park, en el que ya trabajan 10 personas.
Danny Atehortua trabaja para la ciudad y no tenía experiencia como empresario. “Abrir el restaurante, participar en el mercado y el curso que la SBS (Small Business Services de NYC) hace con John han sido mi escuela”, explica.
John es John Wang, el creador del Queens Night Market, un hombre con títulos en negocios y leyes en la Universidad de Yale y que dejó su trabajo en el mundo corporativo para tratar de poner en marcha en Nueva York algo que había visto en Taiwan (de donde es su familia) y en el resto de Asia, un mercado nocturno. Los hay en otras ciudades de EEUU pero en Nueva York, una urbe en la que hay tanta diversidad como creatividad, curiosamente faltaba este tipo de evento.
Hasta que Wang se empeñó en ponerlo en marcha.
El objetivo es dar a conocer la comida tradicional de distintas partes del mundo que no sea fácil encontrar en la ciudad pero que sea con la que han crecido los participantes de este mercado. La oferta comienza antes de la caída de la noche (a las 5.00 pm) y la otra condición es que los precios sean asequibles. El mercado impuso un tope de precios hace un año para que cada platillo costar un máximo de $5 y solo recientemente debido a los aumentos de costos se permite que algunos se vendan a $6.
Este año ya tiene para las 60 plazas de comida 300 solicitudes de distintas cocinas neoyorquinas con raíces en distintas esquinas del planeta, desde Bolivia hasta el Tibet pasando por Polonia, Portugal o Filipinas. “Mucha gente participa por hacer algo diferente, por divertirse, por compartir pero no necesariamente son personas que tienen un negocio o lo quieran”, dice Wang de quienes solicitan hacer y vender la comida.
Para los que lo quieren o necesitan una orientación, el mercado, en asociación con el SBS y el Queens Economic Development Corporation hacen seminarios para los aspirantes a establecerse en el parque. “Primeros pasos y creación de una idea de negocio que funcione”, es este año el tema de la primera de las sesiones que empieza esta misma semana (18 de febrero) para los 70 participantes que ya han reservado su espacio para 2020.

Krugman: Bernie Sanders isn’t a socialist

Autor: Krugman, Paul.

Texto completo: Republicans have a long, disreputable history of conflating any attempt to improve American lives with the evils of “socialism.” When Medicare was first proposed, Ronald Reagan called it “socialized medicine,” and he declared that it would destroy our freedom. These days, if you call for something like universal child care, conservatives accuse you of wanting to turn America into the Soviet Union.
It’s a smarmy, dishonest political strategy, but it’s hard to deny that it has sometimes been effective. And now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination — not an overwhelming front-runner, but clearly the person most likely at the moment to come out on top — is someone who plays right into that strategy, by declaring that he is indeed a socialist.
The thing is, Bernie Sanders isn’t actually a socialist in any normal sense of the term. He doesn’t want to nationalize our major industries and replace markets with central planning; he has expressed admiration, not for Venezuela, but for Denmark. He’s basically what Europeans would call a social democrat — and social democracies like Denmark are, in fact, quite nice places to live, with societies that are, if anything, freer than our own.
So why does Sanders call himself a socialist? I’d say that it’s mainly about personal branding, with a dash of glee at shocking the bourgeoisie. And this self-indulgence did no harm as long as he was just a senator from a very liberal state.
But if Sanders becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, his misleading self-description will be a gift to the Trump campaign. So will his policy proposals. Single-payer health care is (a) a good idea in principle and (b) very unlikely to happen in practice, but by making “Medicare for All” the centerpiece of his campaign, Sanders would take the focus off the Trump administration’s determination to take away the social safety net we already have.
Just to be clear, if Sanders is indeed the nominee, the Democratic Party should give him its wholehearted support. He probably couldn’t turn America into Denmark, and even if he could, President Donald Trump is trying to turn us into a white nationalist autocracy like Hungary. Which would you prefer?
But I do wish that Sanders weren’t so determined to make himself an easy target for right-wing smears.
Speaking of unhelpful political posturing, the runner-up in New Hampshire has also been poisoning his own well. Over the past few days, Pete Buttigieg has chosen to pose as a deficit hawk, thereby demonstrating that while he may be a fresh face, he has remarkably stale ideas.
Maybe Buttigieg is unaware of the growing consensus among mainstream economists that the deficit hysteria of seven or eight years ago was greatly overblown. Last year the former top economists in the Obama administration published an article titled “Who’s Afraid of Budget Deficits?” which concluded, “It’s time for Washington to put away its debt obsession and focus on bigger things.”
And where Sanders is playing right into one disreputable Republican political strategy, Buttigieg is playing into another: the strategy of hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity when a Democrat occupies the White House, then borrowing freely as soon as the GOP regains power. If Democrats win, they should pursue a progressive agenda, not waste political capital cleaning up the GOP’s mess.
Again, if Buttigieg somehow becomes the nominee, the party should back him without reservation. Whatever he may say about deficits, he wouldn’t do what Republicans do: use debt fears as an excuse to slash social programs.
So who will the Democrats nominate? Your guess is as good as mine. What’s really important, however, is that the party stays focused on its strengths and Trump’s weaknesses.
For the fact is that all of the Democrats who would be president, from Bloomberg to Bernie, are at least moderately progressive; they all want to maintain and expand the social safety net, while raising taxes on the wealthy. And all the polling evidence says that America is basically a center-left nation — which is why Trump promised to raise taxes on the rich and protect major social programs during the 2016 campaign.
But he was lying, and at this point everyone with an open mind knows it. So Democrats have a perfect opportunity to portray themselves, truthfully, as the defenders of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the now-popular Affordable Care Act against Republicans who are more or less nakedly favoring the interests of plutocrats over those of working families.
This opportunity will, however, be squandered if the Democratic nominee, whoever he or she is, turns the election into a referendum on either single-payer health care or deficit reduction, neither of which is an especially popular position. Things will be even worse if the Democrats themselves degenerate into squabbles over either ideological purity or fiscal probity.
The point is that whoever gets the nomination, Democrats need to build as broad a coalition as possible. Otherwise they’ll be handing the election to Trump — and that would be a tragedy for the party, the nation and the world.

Texto completo: El narcotraficante Jesús “ el Rey ” Zambada así como Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez, exlegisladora mexicana conocida como la Chapo Diputada no han sido liberados como se informó recientemente en diferentes medios.
“Para quedar libres la orden tendría que venir de un juez federal y de nadie más”, explicó un funcionario del Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos citado anónimamente para el semanario mexicano Proceso, al referirse también a Jorge Cifuentes, narcotraficante colombiano que ayudó al Chapo a trasladar cocaína desde Ecuador.

“Los tres o están bajo la custodia de los US Marshalls (alguaciles federales) o en el programa de testigos protegidos” y es por ello que sus nombres ya no aparecen como si estuvieran bajo la tutela del Buró Federal de Prisiones (BOP, por sus siglas en inglés) de los Estados Unidos.
Lo que explica el por qué el reportero de The New York Times, Alan Feuer , quien ironizó sobre los beneficios que habría obtenido el Rey Zambada tras participar como testigo protegido en el juicio en contra de Joaquín “ el Chapo ” Guzmán .
Cuando el BOP publica que ya no tiene bajo su custodia a un reo, hay dos explicaciones a decir de la fuente de Proceso:
“La primera, es que el reo está en poder de los alguaciles porque lo están llevando a juicios o a su juicio (y para ello tiene que salir de prisión, ya sea a testificar o estar frente al juez de su caso) y la segunda, puede ser que ya ingresó a un programa de testigos protegidos”.
E insistió que “para ambas situaciones, la liberación debe ser dictaminada por un juez federal, el Buró Federal de Prisiones no tiene la potestad de liberar a nadie, para eso existe el poder judicial” según la explicación.
Además puso como ejemplo la vez que el Chapo Guzmán estaba siendo enjuiciado cuando la página oficial del BOP dio cuenta de que había sido liberado y ya no estaba bajo su responsabilidad si no en manos de los alguaciles federales que se hacían cargo de los traslados a la corte y a una cárcel estatal donde se quedaba cuando no había audiencia de su juicio.

Texto completo: Climate change is not the only source of dire projections for the coming decade. Perhaps just as terrifying from both a health and an economic perspective is a predicted continued rise in obesity, including severe obesity, among American adults.
A prestigious team of medical scientists has projected that by 2030, nearly 1 in 2 adults will be obese, and nearly 1 in 4 will be severely obese. The estimates are thought to be particularly reliable, as the team corrected for underestimates of weight given by individuals in national surveys. In as many as 29 states, the prevalence of obesity will exceed 50%, with no state having less than 35% of residents who are obese, they predicted.
Likewise, the team projected, in 25 states the prevalence of severe obesity will be higher than one adult in four, and severe obesity will become the most common weight category among women, non-Hispanic black adults and low-income adults nationally.
Given the role obesity plays in fostering many chronic, disabling and often fatal diseases, these are dire predictions indeed. Yet, as with climate change, the powers that be in this country are doing very little to head off the potentially disastrous results, obesity specialists say.
Well-intentioned efforts like limiting access to huge portions of sugar-sweetened soda, the scientists note, are effectively thwarted by industries able to dwarf the effect of educational efforts by health departments that have comparatively minuscule budgets. With rare exceptions, the sugar and beverage industries have blocked nearly every attempt to add an excise tax to sugar-sweetened beverages.
Claims that such a tax is regressive and unfairly targets low-income people are shortsighted, according to Zachary J. Ward, public health specialist at Harvard and the lead author of the new report, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December.
“What people would save in health care costs would dwarf the extra money paid as taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages,” he said in an interview.
In Philadelphia, where a soda tax of 1.5 cents an ounce took effect three years ago, total purchases declined by 38% even after accounting for beverages bought outside the city, his co-author Sara Bleich said.
However, she quickly added, piecemeal changes like this are not enough to make a significant difference in the obesity forecast for the country. Rather, nationwide changes are needed in the ubiquitous food environment. As the new report clearly demonstrated, Americans weren’t always this fat; since 1990, the prevalence of obesity in this country has doubled.
People who blame genetics are fooling no one but themselves, Ward said. Our genetics haven’t changed in the last 30 years. What has changed is the environment in which our genes now function.
“Food is very cheap in the United States, and super easy to access,” said Bleich, a professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We eat out more, consuming more foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt, and our portion sizes are bigger.
As Ward noted: “You don’t even have to leave home to eat restaurant-prepared food - just call and it will be delivered. If you have a smartphone, Uber Eats will bring fast food to your door in minutes.”
As a society, we also snack more, a habit that starts as soon as toddlers can feed themselves. My dog knows all too well that the bottoms of strollers are a rich source of snacks.
“People are snacking throughout the day,” Ward said. “Snacking is the normal thing to do in the United States. In France, you never see anyone eating on a bus.”
We also eat more highly processed foods, which have been shown to foster weight gain, thanks to their usually high levels of calories, sugar and fat.
A recent study showed that even when controlling for weight, consuming lots of processed foods raises the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
“It doesn’t take that many extra calories to result in weight gain,” Bleich said. “Through marketing, we’re constantly being sold on foods we didn’t even know we wanted. We’re all about immediate rewards. We’re not thinking about the future, which is why we’re going to see more than half the population obese in 10 years.”
Unless something is done to reverse this trend, Ward said, “Obesity will be the new normal in this country. We’re living in an obesogenic environment.”
“While there’s no one thing to throw at the problem,” Bleich said, “if I could wave a magic wand, I’d make a tax on beverages a federal mandate because they’re the largest source of added sugar in the diet and are strongly linked to weight gain and health problems. When people drink their calories, they don’t feel as full as when they consume solid food, so they end up eating more.”

Texto completo: How many astronauts can you name without consulting Google or Wikipedia?
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are easy. They were the first men on the moon. You should probably also remember their command module pilot, Michael Collins. But he wasn’t one of the first on the moon, so he comes less easily to mind.
Christina Koch, who returned to Earth on Feb. 6, might be another name you’ll come to remember. She and Jessica Meir executed the first all-woman spacewalk. Although Koch performed six spacewalks during her mission, set a duration record for time in space and contributed enormously to space science, that October spacewalk will be what gets her into history books.
In the same way, Sally Ride is known for being the first American woman in space, but not for her work in the development of the space shuttle’s robotic arm. In all of these cases, being first was a matter of timing, not something that was under the direct control of the astronauts credited for their trailblazing.
It’s not as if there was a race to be on the first all-female spacewalk. In fact, the opposite might be said to be true.
The presence of Koch and Meir on that spacewalk was practically an accident. NASA has 48 active-duty astronauts, of which 16 are women. The first female spacewalk was supposed to be Anne McClain and Koch last March. But only one suit was available that fit the women, so they had to restaff the spacewalk with a male astronaut.
If the all-female spacewalk had occurred then, McClain, not Koch, would have been its commander. Koch would not be the one who spoke to the president. And this essay might instead be about McClain, who would have been first out of the airlock.
With Koch’s return to Earth, she now holds another distinction: the longest stay by a female astronaut in space, 328 days. (Currently, the American record-holder for the longest single stay is Scott Kelly, with 342 days in space, and the record-holder for cumulative time is Peggy Whitson with 665 days spread over three flights.) Koch volunteered for this mission as part of a long-duration experiment, but the assignment was not in her direct control.
While we celebrate the records Koch now holds, the achievements that come directly from her efforts are less heralded.
She conducted research in microgravity on Mizuna mustard greens, examining the role of gravity and space on whole-plant health, cellular development and tissue growth. Perhaps most importantly, she also looked at how growing plants affects human community. Humans bond over food, and being able to grow food in space could be important to social dynamics during future long-duration crewed missions to the moon or Mars.
During research with the stations’ Advanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME) Chamber, Koch studied the behavior of fire in space. Her work could help spacecraft use fuel more efficiently and help with preventing fires. On Earth, this knowledge can also be applied to reducing combustion pollutants.
And Koch worked with the Cold Atom Laboratory, in which clouds of atoms are chilled to about one ten-billionth of a degree above absolute zero and become nearly motionless, so scientists can study behaviors and quantum characteristics. Kidney health, Earth observations, the International Space Station Agricultural Camera, the Capillary Structures experiment, the Microgravity Crystals experiment, the BioFabrication Facility, CubeSats ... all of this effort, eclipsed by two records.
But those records are important because they signal a change.
We note the first all-female spacewalk because it is a threshold. Koch and Meir also participated in the second and third all-female spacewalks. There will be others, and they will not be noted, because the threshold we’ve crossed leads us into a future where women in space are not the exception.
Likewise, her long-duration mission opens windows of understanding that will be necessary for human spaceflight to the moon and Mars. Currently, most of the data on the effect of radiation on women comes from survivors of Hiroshima. From that, it appears that radiation affects women more significantly than it does men. No one knows why. But NASA regulations restrict the amount of time that women can go into space, because the sample pool has been too small to tell if cosmic radiation acts differently on women’s bodies. Koch’s long-duration mission is a marker that the agency is serious about making space available for everyone.
Many questions remain that could only be answered with her safe return to Earth. NASA flight surgeons and scientists will pore over the changes to her physiology in the same way they studied Kelly and Whitson.
In the future, someone will pass these endurance records. The first woman will walk on the moon, NASA promises. Two or more women will go on the first all-woman launch. Perhaps we’ll see the first all-woman crew on the ISS. But for now, those missions remain mere potentialities. Koch has earned her place in the history books, and by crossing these thresholds, has opened a door to the future.
And, hopefully, she’s become one more astronaut that you can name.

Texto completo: “Don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”
- the President of the United States, making George Orwell look like a psychic.
Meet Brad Parscale. Brad stands 6 feet 8 inches tall and rocks a woolly beard hewn to a point above his broad chest. Brad has been described as a Viking in Armani armor, a characterization Brad wears with outsized pride.
The look suits Brad’s status as a digital culture warrior, a raider of reality, an invader of privacy and usurper of truth who storms the shores of social media to beguile the gullible, inflame haters and conquer “crazy socialist Democrats” who “hate America” and won’t bow before his orange king.
Brad is Berserker-in-Chief of Impeached President Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, and along with weaponizing the internet, email and cellphones, Brad plans to put local newspapers under the sword.
At a recent fundraising event hosted by the Miami Young Republicans, Brad said he is recruiting “swarms of surrogates” to “build up and fight with the local newspapers” who might dare publish content that casts Trump in a negative light. That’s a tall order, considering the president’s chronically unpresidential behavior makes covering him in a positive light a fool’s errand best left to his cheerleaders on Fox “News” and Corporate Hate Radio.
Trump and Friends do a swell job exposing “fake news” in the national media, Brad told the Young Republicans, but Americans tend to trust their local newspapers more than national sources. Eroding that trust is a key strategy in the Trump 2020 playbook.
We know this because Brad said it and it was reported by a local newspaper, The Palm Beach Post. The Post’s report was amplified by McKay Coppins, a staff writer at The Atlantic. His piece in the magazine’s March issue, “The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Re-elect the President,” is a must-read for any American, especially local ink-stained wretches like me.
Coppins offers an inside look at a campaign that embraces the disinformation tactics of dictators and exploits the ubiquity and utility of technology to spread a false Gospel of Trump to every corner of American life. Along with the abuse of social media to spread actual fake news, the campaign plans to use more invasive tactics, like anonymous mass texts sent without the consent of cellphone owners.
A Republican consultant called Brad’s billion-dollar poison kitchen “The Death Star.” Local journalists who resist its influence can expect to be tracked and targeted by trolls, bots and Trump surrogates like I was in 2016. The fake news outlets I tangled with then are gone, but their replacements are better funded and more brazen this time around.
Across the country, local newspapers are struggling. For larger operations like The New York Times and The Washington Post, Trump has been the greatest gift since Nixon. Holding local school districts who ignore environmental contamination in schools accountable, shining sunlight on shady deals and hounding carpet-bagging slumlords is expensive. As advertising revenue dips, subscriptions keep local watchdog reporting alive.
Without you, we go under. Without us, the nation goes dark. Town by town. City by city. County by county. State by state.
I am not afraid of Brad, or his billion-dollar Death Star. I see the coming war as an opportunity to remind Americans that local newspapers are an essential element of the nation’s DNA. The Times-Tribune has been serving this community for 150 years. We’ve beaten better berserkers than Brad.
Brad is from Kansas, a faraway place where a girl named Dorothy and her little dog Toto once lived with Auntie Em. Brad was born in East Topeka, about 21 miles from Scranton, Kansas, a coal town named after the Electric City. Just over 700 people live there, about 6 miles from their 1,300 neighbors in Carbondale, Kansas.
Small world.
A tornado swept Dorothy and Toto to a small world ruled by a bumbling, bombastic fraud who used technology, irrational fear and prescription-strength poppies to stay in power. The Great and Powerful Oz might still be in charge if he had a Brad to handle the special effects.
A relative unknown before the Trump Organization started giving him odd jobs, Brad shot to stardom while running Trump’s online and social media campaign in 2016. With an incumbent president, a billion dollars to burn and a wealth of voter data to exploit, Brad carries big advantages into the 2020 campaign.
Those of us who have been in the game longer than Brad remember another Republican candidate for president who had a lethal, omnipresent media apparatus also dubbed “The Death Star.” His name is Mitt Romney, and he lost Pennsylvania by more than 5 points and Lackawanna County by almost 30 points.
Welcome to Scranton, Brad.
This ain’t Kansas.

Texto completo: Almost everybody admires the Nordic model. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have high economic productivity, high social equality, high social trust and high levels of personal happiness.
Progressives say it's because they have generous welfare states. Some libertarians point out that these countries score high on nearly every measure of free market openness. Immigration restrictionists note that until recently they were ethnically homogeneous societies.
But Nordic nations were ethnically homogeneous in 1800 when they were dirt poor. Their economic growth took off just after 1870, way before their welfare states were established. What really launched the Nordic nations was generations of phenomenal educational policy.
The 19th-century Nordic elites did something we haven't been able to do in this country recently. They realized that if their countries were to prosper they had to create truly successful "folk schools" for the least educated among them. They realized that they were going to have to make lifelong learning a part of the natural fabric of society.
They look at education differently than we do. The German word they used to describe their approach, bildung, doesn't even have an English equivalent. It means the complete moral, emotional, intellectual and civic transformation of the person. It was based on the idea that if people were going to be able to handle and contribute to an emerging industrial society, they would need more complex inner lives.
Today, Americans often think of schooling as the transmission of specialized skill sets - can the student read, do math, recite the facts of biology. Bildung is devised to change the way students see the world. It is devised to help them understand complex systems and see the relations between things - between self and society, between a community of relationships in a family and a town.
As Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman put it in their book "The Nordic Secret," "Bildung is the way that the individual matures and takes upon him or herself ever bigger personal responsibility towards family, friends, fellow citizens, society, humanity, our globe and the global heritage of our species, while enjoying ever bigger personal, moral and existential freedoms."
The Nordic educators worked hard to cultivate each student's sense of connection to the nation. Before the 19th century, most Europeans identified themselves in local and not national terms. But the Nordic curriculum instilled in students a pride in, say, their Danish history, folklore and heritage.
"That which a person did not burn for in his young days, he will not easily work for as a man," Christopher Arndt Bruun wrote. The idea was to create in the mind of the student a sense of wider circles of belonging - from family to town to nation - and an eagerness to assume shared responsibility for the whole.
The Nordic educators also worked hard to develop the student's internal awareness. That is to say, they helped students see the forces always roiling inside the self - the emotions, cravings, wounds and desires. If you could see those forces and their interplay, as if from the outside, you could be their master and not their slave.
Their intuition was that as people grow, they have the ability to go through developmental phases, to see themselves and the world through ever more complex lenses. A young child may blindly obey authority - Mom, Dad, teacher. Then she internalizes and conforms to the norms of the group. Then she learns to create her own norms based on her own values. Then she learns to see herself as a node in a network of selves and thus learns mutuality and holistic thinking.
The purpose of bildung is to help people move through the uncomfortable transitions between each way of seeing.
That educational push seems to have had a lasting influence on the culture. Whether in Stockholm or Minneapolis, Scandinavians have a tendency to joke about the way their sense of responsibility is always nagging at them. They have the lowest rates of corruption in the world. They have a distinctive sense of the relationship between personal freedom and communal responsibility.
High social trust doesn't just happen. It results when people are spontaneously responsible for one another in the daily interactions of life, when the institutions of society function well.
In the U.S., social trust has been on the decline for decades. If the children of privilege get to go to the best schools, there's not going to be much social mutuality. If those schools do not instill a love of nation, there's not going to be much shared responsibility.
If you have a thin educational system that does not help students see the webs of significance between people, does not even help students see how they see, you're going to wind up with a society in which people can't see through each other's lenses.
When you look at the Nordic bildung model, you realize our problem is not only that we don't train people with the right job skills. It's that we don't have the right lifelong development model to instill the mode of consciousness people need to thrive in a complex pluralistic society.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Attack of the swamp creatures

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When conservative ringmaster Matt Schlapp officially didn't invite Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to his annual ultra-right confab - the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) - eye-rolling was suddenly trending.
If little else is transparent in this tiny village where word gets around, Schlapp's motivations surely are. Rather than simply not inviting Romney, which one does by not inviting him, Schlapp tweeted a photo of the senator looking like a corpse-eating zombie along with the CPAC logo and the words: "Not invited: Mitt Romney."
Ostensibly, Schlapp was concerned that Romney might be subjected to physical violence at the conference because of his solitary Republican vote to convict Trump on one of two charges, abuse of power, in the impeachment trial. This concern could have remained buried in Schlapp's furrowed brow but for his apparent determination to say it aloud in the context of a mean-spirited non-invitation.
It's not for nothing that Schlapp has seen his lobbying and public relations firm, Cove Strategies, win massive earnings in the Trump era. He boasted to the New York Times that lobbying revenues increased from $600,000 in 2015 to more than $1 million in 2017, and that "strategic communications" revenues were even higher. In the swampiest of swamps, "strategic communications" obviously pays.
What's clear, of course, is that Schlapp was never going to invite Romney to CPAC. Not only has Schlapp been a Donald Trump man since Day One, as he told me back in 2017, but he also sensed at the onset that Trump would win. This is because Schlapp knows the conservative base perhaps better than anyone, as he should.
As for CPAC, Schlapp typically invites only political stars who might make headlines. Sometimes he might include lesser-known politicians eager for the exposure and, who knows, maybe Schlapp's services.
Proactively snubbing Romney was a win-win for Schlapp that showcased his messaging skills and, inadvertently, revealed his character. When a man is down, by all means kick the daylights out of him. In so doing, Schlapp ingratiated himself to his base, received bounteous media attention, and maybe even earned a little grace for his wife, Mercedes "Mercy" Schlapp.
Mercy was White House director of strategic communications until last July when she joined Trump's re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the past overlap of Schlapp's CPAC sponsors and his clients - including Comcast, Altria, and the Motion Picture Association of America - has not gone unnoticed by a contingent of critics who refer to the conference as "The Matt and Mercy Show."
Schlapp knows as well as anyone that Romney is an honorable man and is surely believable when he says his Senate vote was a matter of principle and not, as some have suggested, revenge. (After publicly courting Romney for secretary of state, Trump chose someone else, seemingly to humiliate his at-the-time former critic.) Even if Romney might derive a tiny bit of satisfaction from the fact that his faith-driven principles didn't allow him to acquit Trump, what does he really get out of being an outlier - other than the respect of liberals who would admire Hannibal Lecter if he feasted on Republicans?
Poor Romney - right as rain, yet nobody can spare an umbrella. As a presidential candidate, people said he was too squeaky clean. Or, he didn't pass the beer test. When he said during his 2012 presidential campaign that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe, people scoffed.
Who's scoffing now?
An argument could be made that Schlapp really was concerned about violence, but what kind of show is he directing? At the 2018 CPAC, conservative columnist Mona Charen had to be escorted out of the conference by security when she was booed for scolding Republicans for not condemning Trump's alleged sexual misconduct. But more likely, such alleged fears were an excuse rather than a reason to justify his tweet.
By essentially encouraging the mob, Schlapp made his bed on the wrong side of conservative principles and, ultimately, of history. Luckily for him, the Romney we both know would probably accept an apology.

Texto completo: Analysis
WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr threw his Justice Department into turmoil this week as he seized control of cases tied to Donald Trump, risking a rebellion within the ranks, and publicly criticized the president amid accusations both men have politicized America's top law enforcement agency.
In the span of five days, Barr revealed that he's established a private channel for Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to relay his allegations on Ukraine and ordered prosecutors to reduce their sentencing recommendation for Trump associate Roger Stone.
News also surfaced that Barr has moved to review the prosecution of Michael Flynn, the president's first national security adviser.
At week's end, the Justice Department's reputation for independence was under siege in a way it hadn't seen since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Barr had managed to take steps that seemed likely to anger everyone from Trump to Democrats and Justice Department career prosecutors.
"The history of the department, when it's written, will have two parts - before Trump and after Trump," said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor. "This is the hinge."
After the beleaguered tenure of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Barr will have the biggest hand in shaping that history. Having helped Trump navigate through a special counsel probe of Russian election interference and an impeachment crisis, Barr now faces the biggest test of his leadership since taking over one year ago.
Critics, including former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump weeks into his presidency, said the department's reputation for independence built on the ashes of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s was being demolished.
"The Justice Department is not a tool of any president to be used for retribution or camouflage," Yates wrote Friday in the Washington Post. "From virtually the moment he took office, President Trump has attempted to use the Justice Department as a cudgel against his enemies and as a shield for himself and his allies."
Adding to the week's controversies - and confusion - Barr issued a rare public rebuke of Trump on Thursday over the president's constant tweets and comments about Justice Department cases, saying he can't perform his duties if he appears to be politically influenced.
And the department announced Friday that it won't prosecute former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, despite Trump's repeated demands to go after him.
Soon after taking office last year, Barr established himself as one of Trump's most loyal Cabinet aides. Long known as an advocate of executive power, Barr had helped sink criminal prosecutions in the Iran-Contra affair by successfully advocating for President George H.W. Bush to issue a wave of pardons before leaving office.
Barr has repeatedly rejected accusations that he's doing Trump's political bidding, saying "the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case." Trump undercut his attorney general on Twitter Friday, arguing he does have the power to intervene if he wishes.
Barr said he acted in the case of Stone because he thought the initial Justice Department recommendation of seven to nine years in prison was too severe. Instead, in a move with few parallels, the department revoked its recommendation and filed a new one.
Four career prosecutors resigned in quick succession from the Stone case rather than stand by Barr's decision. But Trump praised and congratulated Barr.
Barr's decision to review the Flynn prosecution, first reported by the New York Times, was another sign he's taking a personal interest in cases being handled by the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia, including those that were brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Jensen to examine the case against Flynn and potentially other matters, according to a person familiar with the decision.
Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia's ambassador. He's since accused prosecutors of "egregious misconduct" and sought to have the charges dismissed.
Barr recently appointed one of his top aides, Timothy Shea, to be acting U.S. attorney for the D.C. office.
The attorney general's supporters pushed back on accusations that he's a hired political hand, pointing to the department's announcement Friday that it has closed the criminal investigation of McCabe.
But that won't appease the attorney general's critics. Nine Democratic senators, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, called on Friday for Barr to resign over the intervention in Stone's case.
The week's developments escalated a long-percolating debate over whether Trump is meddling inappropriately in the Justice Department - and whether Barr is letting him do it.
In September, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said at a hearing that "it's a banana republic" when an impression is created that "undue pressure is brought to bear" even if it doesn't affect an eventual decision.
"I just think the integrity of the process is being unduly undermined by inappropriate comments and actions on the part of people at the top of our government," he said in a hearing on a lawsuit by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that the organization, an advocacy group, got permission to unseal on Friday. "And I think as a government and as a society we're going to pay a price at some point for this."

Veterans Affairs faces turmoil again Firing of deputy secretary latest in string of incidents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Let communities choose their own architecture

Texto completo: Casting a critical eye at banks that resembled Roman temples, the great Chicago architect Louis Sullivan famously wrote nearly 120 years ago that their bankers should wear togas and sandals, and conduct business in Latin.
To Sullivan, Roman Revival banks were architectural fakes, their columns and pediments mere drapery that had nothing to do with their underlying construction.
Yet today, it's hard to stroll down Chicago's LaSalle Street financial canyon without admiring the banking temples along the street. They may be stage-set architecture, but they're stage sets for the ages -- their proportions, materials and details powerfully communicating a message of financial stability.
I bring up Sullivan and the LaSalle Street banks because the debate over a profoundly misguided proposal, which would establish classical architecture as the preferred style for many federal buildings, already is devolving into a superficial style war -- a new front in the culture wars roiling Donald Trump's America.
Predictably, left-leaning opponents of the plan are portraying classicism as reactionary, arguing, as a Chicago Sun-Times editorial did last week, that the plan would take us "back into a bygone era when women wore bonnets, men wore tricorn hats and the only acceptable design for a federal building was a knockoff of a classical Greek or Roman structure."
The view from the right is equally warped. Writing on the City Journal website, the critic Catesby Leigh opines that modernist federal buildings fail to "speak to the aspirations of ordinary citizens." How does he know?
Chicagoans rightly admire the modernist design of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Federal Center, but Leigh puts down its handsomely proportioned, elegantly detailed high-rises as "boxy," trashes its transparent low-rise post office as "squat" and deems the entire complex, including the vibrant plaza highlighted by Alexander Calder's bright red Flamingo sculpture, as "not exactly a tour de force."
The people who live here know better.
Here's the point: Style wars invariably fail to address the underlying characteristics -- including function, security, sustainability, accessibility and compatibility with a specific site, climate and culture -- that render architecture and urban design worthy or not. No style, classical or modernist, has a monopoly on quality. The problem with the proposal in question isn't classicism. It's the imposition of classicism and other traditional styles from a single central authority, a move that would undercut the very democratic ideals that classicism is supposed to represent.
As the Chicago-based Society of Architectural Historians and other organizations wrote in a letter to Trump Monday, joining opponents of the plan such as the American Institute of Architects and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, "we ... remain convinced that the dictation of style -- any style -- is not the path to excellence in civic architecture."
The controversial plan, a draft executive order now circulating in the Trump White House, would overturn guiding principles for federal architecture -- courthouses, agency headquarters and the like -- that have been in place since 1962. The forward-thinking principles have been a touchstone for the General Services Administration, the agency that commissions federal buildings. In 1994, it created a Design Excellence program that has tapped the talents of such Chicago architects as Carol Ross Barney, designer of the Oklahoma City federal building that replaced the one that a truck bomb destroyed in 1995, killing 168 people.
Written by future New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the principles, critically, are neutral on the question of style.
Federal buildings "must provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government," the principles say. But they add, pointedly, that "the development of an official style must be avoided. Design must flow from the architectural profession to the Government, and not vice versa."
In other words, officials styles were for the totalitarian governments American was fighting during the Cold War era of the 1960s. The principles, in contrast, equated democratic freedom with architectural pluralism: Federal buildings should reflect regional architectural traditions and, by implication, the diverse character of the American people.
That is very different from the stereotype of one-size-fits-all, steel-and-glass modernism.
The organization spearheading the draft executive order is a tiny Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, the National Civic Art Society. In 2012, Philanthropy magazine reported that its chief funder was Chicago investor Richard H. Driehaus, sponsor of the Driehaus Prize for traditional and classical architecture.
Anne Lazar, executive director of Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, confirmed Tuesday that personal contributions from Driehaus to the group are ongoing, but she declined to answer what Driehaus thinks of the draft executive order, which carries a title, "Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again," that riffs on Trump's slogan to "Make America Great Again."
The National Civic Art Society's position, however, is quite clear: Modernism is a plague on our collective house, a rupture with the evolving classical tradition that began with the Greeks and Romans; flowered during the Renaissance via such masters as Italy's Andrea Palladio; informed the Founding Fathers, especially the architect-President Thomas Jefferson; and inspired the celebrated "White City" ensemble of Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.
"The public finds it ugly, strange, and off-putting," the group says of modern architecture on its website. "It has created a built environment that is degraded and dehumanizing."
Wiser classicists know better: Modernism, now well over a century old, is, like it or not, a part of history whose impact cannot be wished away. And while modernism's glassy, transparent volumes boldly departed from the solid masses of classically-inspired buildings, its masters, like Mies, simultaneously learned from that tradition and enlivened it by placing their buildings and urban spaces in vivid counterpoint to it. A sterling Chicago example, chiefly designed by Jacques Brownson, is the Richard J. Daley Center, the muscular court's high-rise whose bridgelike beams relate directly in scale to the monumental Corinthian columns of the City Hall-County Building across Clark Street.
There are few better examples of what the Yale architectural historian Vincent Scully called "a continuing dialogue between the generations which creates an environment developing across time."
That development doesn't degrade our cities. It enlivens them. We would all be poorer without it.
Both sides in the federal buildings debate need to take off ideological blinders. There is nothing inherently regressive about a classical federal building, just as there is nothing inherently progressive about a modernist one. The spectrum of classical design ranges from the transcendent excellence of the Parthenon to the megalomaniacal vision for post-World War II Berlin drawn up by Hitler's architect, Albert Speer. So, too, with modernism, which spans the gamut from the rigor and refinement of the Mies-designed Federal Center to the coarse concrete of the Brutalist FBI headquarters on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, by Chicago architects C.F. Murphy Associates.
I do not quiver at a trend noted by a New York Times editorial on this subject that the General Services Administration has begun to construct more buildings in a classical style. If local communities and their leaders choose in coordination with the federal government to build in that style, and it can serve functional needs in a reasonably economical way, those communities and leaders have every right to do so. The point is the choice, and maintaining the ability to choose.
While it's true that the federal government once set aesthetic standards for federal buildings, opting for a streamlined version of Art Deco during the Depression, the nation has changed markedly since then. We are more diverse, not just demographically but architecturally. Pluralism reigns, just as our national motto ("E pluribus unum," Latin for "Out of many, one") suggests it should. Our buildings should reflect that diversity, not mask it.

Texto completo: When Hurricane Dorian slammed into the Bahamas in September, it not only leveled entire communities and killed dozens of people, it also destroyed about 30% of the coral reefs around the islands, according to a report issued by the Perry Institute for Marine Science.
"We saw on several reefs that a significant amount of corals were broken, rolled around on the bottom and killed, or just smashed up to the point that the actual structure of the reef itself was reduced to rubble," said Craig Dahlgren, lead researcher at the Perry Institute, which has been examining effects of the hurricane since October.
Reef structures the size of small cars were dislodged or buried in debris, mud and sediment several feet deep, in some instances, Dahlgren said.
Reef diving and snorkeling are an important part of the country's tourism industry, which accounts for some 50% of its gross domestic product.
Even before the Category 5 storm, the reefs were in jeopardy. In 2016, the Perry Institute, based in Waitsfield, Vermont, found reefs in the Bahamas to be under stress and classified them as impaired, the category just above poor.
Healthy reefs are vital to marine ecosystems in the area, and the storm damage appears to have hit the country's fisheries as well.
Dahlgren's team reported a significant decline in fish populations linked to habitat damage. In addition to extremely turbulent waters, Dorian brought a surge of rainwater that changed sea salinity. The storm also caused water temperatures to fluctuate rapidly -- both conditions that quite likely shocked the corals, according to researchers.
But the report's news was not all bad.
"We did see some areas that came out of it looking almost untouched, amazingly," Dahlgren said.

Veterans Affairs faces turmoil again

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members -- in at least one case a medical director -- of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Warren isn't out of race yet, so stop writing political obituary

Texto completo: Yoo hoo! Elizabeth Warren fans! Over here!
Yes, we're still here. Gather round. Scooch on in. We've been shoved into this little corner at the edge of the stage, but we're not leaving yet. The pundits' wind is bitter cold, and history is giving us the wary eye, and our friends are sniffing, "Get over it."
Nevertheless, we persist. So does Elizabeth Warren.
It's not that we Warren fans dislike the other Democratic candidates. Or maybe it's better to say that not all of us dislike all of them. Go Amy. Go Pete. Go Anybody Who Can Beat the Foul-Mouthed Autocrat-in-Chief.
What we don't like? It's the way Warren has been written out of the 2020 presidential race faster than you can say "Iowa and New Hampshire."
We all know what happened in Iowa and New Hampshire. Once again, two small, overwhelming white, not-very-urban states cast the first votes in the Democratic primary.
Two states. Out of 50. Two states with a white population above 90%, in a country far more diverse than that. Two states with a combined total population less than half of metro Chicago's. These two states, with unspectacular voter turnouts, have picked their favorite candidates, and Warren wasn't among them.
So R.I.P., Pocahontas!
(May as well get the Pocahontas-Fauxcahontas bit out of the way now and save certain readers the work of pointing it out.)
But here in the chilly sidelines of the political stage, we Warren fans aren't convinced an obituary is in order yet, despite the media dirges.
In many news reports Warren has become a footnote, or has vanished altogether, while the media gaze shifts to exciting new dramas.
Look! It's the "battle" between Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg! It's the "surge" of Sen. Amy Klobuchar! And there's "billionaire" Mike Bloomberg "storming" Super Tuesday states!
Former Vice President Joe Biden's name stays in the headlines, too, because his decline from front-runner to laggard has been so tragically stark.
But Warren? Her swift "fall," as it's being called, has been less heralded than Biden's, though in the few days since the New Hampshire primary her name has been resurrected just long enough to bury it.
"What Happened to Elizabeth Warren?" asked The New Yorker.
"Elizabeth Warren faces a harsh reality after disappointing finishes," intoned CNN, which went on to warn that "no candidate in modern political history has overcome such dire finishes in the first two contests."
("Dire" means that she came in third in Iowa, ahead of Biden.)
A New York Times headline noted that Warren "said she did not want to 'burn down the rest of the party' in order to triumph. And then she lost in New Hampshire." The story's tone was elegiac.
All of these reports are based on facts. But truth is more than fact. Truth involves how facts are presented -- and how facts are presented can affect what turns out to be true.
When the media repeat often enough that a candidate is doomed, the odds increase that they're right. Prophecies of doom sow seeds of doubt. All of us want to back a winner and when the seeds of doubt grow large enough, it's only natural, sometimes logical, to switch allegiances.
But the alacrity with which Warren has been hustled out of the story should put us on guard. We shouldn't let quickie postelection stories be the sum of what we know and think, or a guide to what we do.
The same is true of polls. According to a couple of polls, Warren faces doomsday again in South Carolina's upcoming primary.
On the other hand, there's a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll that suggests Warren is potentially stronger than it seems. That poll measures how each of the Democratic candidates would fare in a one-on-one contest with Sanders. He handily beats them all -- except Warren, who trails him by only two points.
But, again, we should be wary of polls. Like political stories and opinions, they have their place, but they're not the whole truth. We, the people, decide the truth by voting.
Democratic voters in 48 more states will soon get a chance to express their opinion, and the questions we need to ask ourselves as we go vote will, of course, include: Who do I think can beat Donald Trump?
But we also need to ask: Who do I think will make a good president? Who is practical enough, ethical enough, experienced enough, tough enough to guide this big, crazy country? Who works well with others? Who can I trust? Who can I stand to listen to for the next four years?
It's too soon to assume that Elizabeth Warren isn't the answer.
Persist.

Rihanna's line accused of deceptive marketing

Texto completo: When singer Rihanna started a lingerie collection in 2018, she teamed up with the startup behind Kate Hudson's athleisure line Fabletics.
But Fabletics and the startup TechStyle Fashion Group faced complaints about deceptive billing tactics, and now Rihanna's line, Savage x Fenty, is now facing the same criticism.
The line has been praised for using models of different body types and ethnicities in its marketing. But on Tuesday, Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization, said Savage x Fenty "ensnares consumers into unwanted monthly charges" through a membership plan that was difficult to opt out of. It said it had alerted the Federal Trade Commission to the line's business practices, which it believes violate the agency's rules and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.
When consumers buy items like bras and underwear from the Savage x Fenty website, the brand allegedly enrolls consumers in $50 monthly subscriptions "without disclosing all the material terms and conditions of the offer," Truth in Advertising said. The prices that appear when an item is added to a shopper's online cart -- say, $19.50 for a pair of leggings -- require a membership. For nonmembers, the price of the leggings would more than double. Truth in Advertising added that the brand also used "dissuasion and diversion tactics" when consumers tried to cancel memberships.
Savage x Fenty denied the claims. "These accusations are false and based on misconceptions of our business," Emma Tully, a representative for the line, said in an email.
"At Savage x Fenty, we believe strongly in transparency, which is why we provide multiple disclosures of membership terms throughout the shopping experience, within advertisements and through our ambassador engagement policies," she said.
The complaint from Truth in Advertising involves the pervasiveness of so-called negative-option billing online, which refers to the practice of companies charging consumers for a service unless it is specifically declined.
"A lot of consumers really love the fact that this brand is championing female empowerment and inclusiveness, and so they are very willing to purchase products from this website," Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth in Advertising, said. "What they don't understand is that the prices they're seeing on social media are prices for joining a membership, and because of the way the checkout process works, they are unwittingly being put into a subscription model."

Texto completo: Russia is expected to drop into second place in the gold medal count for the 2014 Winter Olympics after sports officials on Saturday disqualified a biathlon winner for testing positive for a steroid, the New York Times reported.
If upheld by the International Olympic Committee and on expected appeals, the ruling would signify the final unraveling of a Russian effort to dominate medal counts by cheating with a state-sponsored doping program.
The International Biathlon Union ruled that Evgeny Ustyugov, who competed in a gold-medal-winning relay team, had used a banned steroid during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. "The consequences include the disqualification of Mr. Ustyugov's results from the Olympic Games 2014, in which he won a gold medal," the group said.
Fallout from the doping program has cut the number of Russian medals won at the 2014 games the country hosted. The supremacy in gold medals in Sochi has been a point of national pride.
College football: A former Wisconsin football player who is the brother of a 2011 Super Bowl standout surrendered to Chicago police in connection with the deaths of two people who were found with gunshot wounds on a Wisconsin road and later died. Marcus Randle El, 33, was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Randle El's brother, Antwaan Randle El, was a star QB at Indiana and spent nine years with the NFL, including as a receiver for the Steelers.
Football: The agent for Steelers QB Mason Rudolph says Browns DE Myles Garrett opened himself up for potential legal action after reiterating his claim that Rudolph used a racial slur shortly before their infamous November brawl. Garrett was reinstated after an indefinite suspension last week.

Texto completo: The White House told Congress on Friday that President Donald Trump authorized the strike last month that killed Iran's most important general to respond to attacks that had already taken place and deter future ones, contradicting the president's claim that he acted in response to an imminent threat.
In a legally mandated, two-page unclassified memo to lawmakers, the White House asserted that the strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani was "in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months" by Iran and Iran-backed militias.
"The purposes of this action were to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests, to degrade Iran's and Quds Force-backed militias' ability to conduct attacks, and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks," said the report, which was transmitted Friday to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The document confirmed what lawmakers had privately suspected as the Trump administration has offered a shifting set of justifications for the strike against Soleimani in Baghdad -- taken with no congressional consultation -- that brought the United States and Iran to the brink of war.
"This official report directly contradicts the president's false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies," Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. "The administration's explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the president offered to the American people was false, plain and simple."
In the days after the strike that killed Soleimani, administration officials gave a variety of rationales for the action as they confronted questions about why the president undertook such a provocative move that could incite an escalation with a dangerous rival.
Trump and other top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said the strike was conducted in response to imminent threats to American lives, but they declined to provide any evidence, leaving lawmakers in both parties irate.
Pressed over several days, Pompeo conceded that the United States did not have specific intelligence on where or when an attack would take place.
Trump claimed that four U.S. embassies had been targeted for attacks, but under questioning during a television interview, Mark Esper, secretary of defense, said he had seen no evidence of that.
Trump later insisted on Twitter that Soleimani had, in fact, been planning an imminent attack on U.S. forces but added, "it doesn't really matter because of his horrible past!"
The report Friday came a day after the Senate passed a resolution aimed at restraining Trump's war-making powers with Iran.
The rare bipartisan vote illustrated the depth of the skepticism in both parties about the president's strategy and lawmakers' frustration with the administration's refusal to consult Congress on military matters.
The House is expected to pass the measure soon, sending it to the president's desk. Trump's advisers have said he will veto it.
The White House infuriated lawmakers in January when it sent Congress a formal notification, required under the War Powers Act, of the drone strikes. Lawmakers had expected it to lay out a legal justification for the strike, but the document was classified, and officials who read it said it contained no information on future threats or an imminent attack.
Lawmakers were further angered by briefings delivered by administration officials that they described as insulting and demeaning, complaining that they were dismissed for questioning the administration's strategy.

What Harvey Weinstein's lawyer fails to grasp

Texto completo: We should talk about minute 24.
It's the moment on "The Daily," the New York Times podcast, when reporter Megan Twohey asks Harvey Weinstein's lead defense attorney, Donna Rotunno, if she's ever been sexually assaulted.
"I have not," Rotunno answers. "I have not. Because I would never put myself in that position."
Twohey, co-author of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which chronicles the Weinstein story from start to publication, pauses.
"So you're saying -- actually, I'm sorry," Twohey says after a beat. "So you're saying that you have never been sexually assaulted because you would never put yourself in the position of being sexually assaulted?"
"No," Rotunno answers. "I've always made choices, from college-age on, where I never drank too much, I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance. Ever."
Rotunno has a role to play, and she's not going to go off-script during an interview with the reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting that took down her client. Rotunno's job is to cast doubt on Weinstein's accusers. Her answer attempts to do just that.
But it also propels an ugly myth about assault that we need to push back on when it rears its ugly head.
Rape is not caused by poor choices. Rape is caused by rapists.
You can try to minimize your risks of being raped, just as you can try to minimize your risks of becoming the victim of any number of violent crimes. But that's not always enough. And if it has, for you, been enough, you are also the beneficiary of some very good luck.
Good luck to have been born into a home in which no one preyed upon you. Far, far too many children aren't so lucky.
Good luck to have never crossed paths with a predatory coach or mentor or youth group leader or priest or classmate or instructor or medical practitioner or boss.
Good luck to have not been the victim of spousal rape.
Good luck to have never been abducted.
Good luck to have gone through life, so far, without someone using their power -- power in the form of a weapon, power in the form of physical size, power in the form of authority -- to rob you of your bodily agency.
I wish every woman and man, girl and boy had such luck. They don't.
Maybe Rotunno subscribes to the just-world fallacy -- the belief that we live in a morally fair society, and people who encounter misfortune likely had some hand in causing that fate. That's certainly easier than accepting that terrible things sometimes just happen. Unprovoked. Unjustly.
Or maybe she answered in the way that felt, to her, as honest as possible while still being as strategic as possible.
Regardless, her answer was toxic.
Because it adds to the already far too prevalent messages that assault survivors are slapped in the face with repeatedly: that they could have prevented their assault, that they had some hand in causing their assault, that they should have known better than to become a victim of assault.
It contributes to a culture of doubt and denial and blame that victims have to navigate when deciding whether to come forward with their stories -- stories that, if they are heard and heeded, can save more people from being victimized. How many athletes may have been spared Larry Nassar's reign of terror if coaches and parents and college administrators acted as soon as the gymnasts in his care started speaking up?
And it slows us down from learning what we really need to grasp and understand about sexual assault: that it is, above all, an abhorrent abuse of power. It is a stripping away of another person's autonomy. It is a debasing of that person's humanity. It says, "I matter. You don't."
No one puts themselves in that position. To surrender their autonomy and humanity. To not matter.
Rotunno is doing her job. Maybe it will work in court; maybe it won't.
But when her words float into the national dialogue as they did on that podcast, the rest of us get to make our own judgment. The rest of us get to reject that (il)logic.
The rest of us get to overrule that kind of toxic messaging and make sure it doesn't find a safe place to land and grow and spread.

Singing a new-show tune

Texto completo: At a Queens Studio lot, on a frigid Monday in November, the actor Jonny Beauchamp, in wig, fake lashes, gloves and platform heels, took a deep breath -- as deep as his flame-colored corset allowed -- and readied himself for the next take.
On "Katy Keene," a "Riverdale" spinoff on the CW, Beauchamp plays Jorge, an aspiring Broadway chorus boy who also performs as his drag alter ego, Ginger. This episode, the sixth, would see Ginger competing in a drag pageant at Molly's Crisis, an outrageous, loving homage to the Greenwich Village piano bar Marie's Crisis. For the talent portion, Ginger would sing Beyonce's "Pretty Hurts."
"And let me tell you, honey," he said gesturing to his corset, "this hurts."
Although he had recorded a backing track the night before, he insisted on singing live instead of lip-syncing, "to give it that extra verve," he said.
He isn't singing alone. This winter, on networks and streaming services, other characters are joining in -- in church, on the sidewalk, in restaurants, bedrooms, rehearsal rooms, open-plan offices and pour-over coffee bars. They are singing new songs and old ones, show tunes and pop hits, rock and rap and the occasional hallelujah chorus.
New shows like "Katy Keene" and "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist," a musical procedural on NBC, join fall arrivals such as "Perfect Harmony," a single-camera comedy on NBC; "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series," a mockumentary-style series on Disney Plus; and "Soundtrack," an hourlong drama on Netflix. Each includes at least one musical number per episode, often many more.
More musical series are in the works, like a collaboration among Alicia Keys and the "Greatest Showman" composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul for Showtime and Damien Chazelle's "The Eddy," set in a Paris nightclub and bound for Netflix. MGM is developing a Billy Joel jukebox anthology. The Chainsmokers are producing a Freeform series. Remember the musical episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" when a demon came to town and made everyone sing ballads and patter songs? Television is like that now.
"Musicals are no longer nerdy," said Tim Federle, the showrunner for "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series." Or maybe more nerds have made it to pitch meetings.
Either way, programming executives have pegged musical series as a way to break out amid TV's ever-growing glut. New series "are looking to stand out but also to really connect to audiences," said NBC executive Lisa Katz. "It's undeniable that music is something that people connect to."
Broadly, and with exceptions, the musical surfeit speaks to impulses that are both utopian and mercenary. On the one hand, musicals are a pleasure and an escape, an antidote to the antihero. In an era of atomized programming, their soundtracks -- which range from the Beatles and Dolly Parton to Nicki Minaj and Imagine Dragons -- aim for big-tent appeal.
"People who are from very different backgrounds and different worlds can all have a shared experience of liking a song," said Lesley Wake Webster, the creator of "Perfect Harmony."
On the other, there's a clear desire to replicate a hit like "Glee," which spawned tours, companion shows, album sales. And executives know that a musical number is immediately uploadable, excerptable -- a fast-track to fan engagement and a stealthy way to stretch an advertising budget.
Still, strumming a ukulele doesn't guarantee going viral, and musical series have an iffy history. When I was growing up, after "The Partridge Family," before "Glee," a musical series was mostly a punch line. "Cop Rock," anyone?
But the success of "Glee," as well as that of other recent shows like "Nashville" and "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," proved that musical series can thrive.
Which might have suggested that most of these new shows were dreamed up by marketing VPs. But the reality is more complicated and in some cases more personal.
"Perfect Harmony," a romance between a snooty Princeton professor (Bradley Whitford) and a rube choir, seems like a match made in focus group. But Webster based it on her grandfather, Arthur Wake, a hotshot choir director who spent his final years mentoring singers in rural Kentucky.
Each series has to decide how to assimilate song and story. In "Perfect Harmony," "Katy Keene" and the "High School Musical" series, the music is mostly diegetic, meaning that it occurs within the story -- characters sing because they are in rehearsal or at a karaoke bar. "Soundtrack," a lip-synced series about a varied group of Los Angelenos, and "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist," about a young coder who can hear the innermost thoughts of her fellow San Franciscans via popular song, approach things like Broadway musicals. The music just appears, anywhere, anytime.
But those dance breaks and melismatic runs still need to be earned, so strict rules have been drafted for why and how a show's characters should sing.
Austin Winsberg, the showrunner for "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist," wrote a 27-page manifesto stipulating that each song had to reveal character, drive story or at least make a joke. (Also, jazz hands and kick lines were out.) "Soundtrack," created by Joshua Safran, the showrunner for the second season of "Smash," constructed the show's story around the songs. He built playlists for each character and let the songs, typically four to six per episode, guide the plot.
And yet, as Webster admitted, "Sometimes it's just like, 'Gosh, wouldn't it just be really fun to have them sing right now?' "
That said, "fun" wasn't a word many of the musical showrunners threw around. The breathless pace of episodic television and the added demands of music and dance make for an unforgiving combination.
A song typically requires more takes and more setups than a dialogue scene, and every gesture has to match the backing track. "As somebody who's done both action and musicals, it is as big as your biggest action sequence," Safran told me. Which means that it can occasionally feel like a car crash. Kate Reinders, a Broadway performer who stars on "High School Musical," said, "Sometimes you feel like you never maybe get there."
Or maybe you get somewhere else. Jane Levy, who stars in "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist," said that during a song-and-dance number, "It feels like the molecules in the air around us suddenly change.
"It's just a little bit more joyful, a little bit more connected."

Texto completo: "Coffee," said Buzzy O'Keeffe, owner of New York's renowned River Cafe in Brooklyn, "is the last thing a restaurant diner tastes -- so it better be good."
For O'Keeffe, it seems, it's never good enough. Every couple of weeks he assembles his chef and several staff members for a blind tasting of brews from around the world. Those that pass muster -- typically under 20% -- might find their way into the restaurant's ever-changing house blend, which typically contains beans from Colombia, Brazil, Sumatra and Costa Rica.
"I have been searching for the perfect coffee since my 30s," said O'Keeffe, now in his discriminating 70s. "I have found that even the perfect blend will vary from time to time, depending on the year's crop -- something like wine but not quite as fickle."
Last year, when I learned that he was planning a trip to coffee plantations in Costa Rica, I asked if I could tag along, a caffeinated cohort one might say.
On a balmy Sunday evening we arrived in San Jose, the country's sprawling capital.
O'Keeffe was interested in comparing freshly roasted Arabica coffee (Arabica beans are the highest quality; robusta beans are generally for the mass market) with what he purchases once the beans are exported to New York. (They should be very similar if delivered promptly and shielded from air and sunlight.) Our first destination was a coffee company outside of San Jose called Cafe Britt. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Aronson, an American now living in Costa Rica and a world authority on coffee whose career dates to the early 1970s as an apprentice taster in Manhattan.
"At that time all of the good Costa Rican coffee was exported, and the inferior stuff stayed here," Aronson explained. He wanted to change that. He launched the first gourmet coffee growing and roasting company in the country and began domestic distribution while at the same time building his export trade. Today Britt coffee is sold throughout much of Central and South America.
The company conducts hourlong tours of its half-acre educational plantation, followed by a discussion and a short film. Guests are taken through the steps of coffee bean processing from planting seedlings to harvesting what are called "coffee cherries," large red pods that hold two coffee beans each. Newly planted coffee bushes require three to four years to produce cherries. Once removed the beans are dried, husked in a special machine, graded and packed for transport. Some operations, like Britt, roast their beans in house before shipping. At the end of our tour came a "cupping," the professional term for coffee assessments. (The cupping is not part of the basic tour; there is a $20 supplement per person.)
"OK, when we begin will the coffee still be hot?" O'Keeffe inquired, sitting at a big round table holding about 20 half-filled ceramic cups. As with wine, the temperature at which coffee is served at professional tastings alters its characteristics -- hot coffee releases more aromatics.
The coffee cups on the table contained brews from Arabica beans cultivated at different altitudes. Among them: Tarrazu, which thrives in the high mountains southwest of San Jose (typically characterized as medium-bodied and high in acid, with hints of chocolate); Tres Rios, east of the capital (also with ample acid and a full, smooth body); Central Valley (the high altitude region west of the capital and known for smooth and full-bodied brews); and Orosí, to the southeast, said to be almost floral, although that eluded us amateurs.
Aronson called out instructions.
"Stir the coffee, then place your nose so it's almost touching it. Sniff. Then lift the cup over your lip and slurp." Expectoration optional.
O'Keeffe tasted each brew methodically, returning to several for another slurp. He said that, for the most part, the differences were more subtle than he had expected.
"Being down here, I thought I'd be tasting peaches or something," he laughed.
The Britt tour, about an hour, concludes with a Costa Rican buffet lunch.

Heading to Starbucks central
The following morning we drove 5,000 feet above the lushly carpeted valley on the slopes of the irascible Poás Volcano, to the 2-year-old Starbucks global agronomy complex and visitors center called Hacienda Alsacia. I would go for the view alone. Situated on a 600-acre working plantation, it is where the company conducts farming research and development, creates programs to help small-scale coffee farmers around the world boost their income and educates the public about what Starbucks calls sustainable coffee.
The 1 1/2-hour tour is similar to that at Britt but more hands-on. It starts with demonstrations on how seedlings are planted and allowed to mature, and on how to dry beans by raking them over hot cement. At one point the tour guide asked for a volunteer to help dry the beans under a wilting sun. There were no takers. He drafted O'Keeffe, who stepped forward wearing the bemused expression of someone called onto the stage by a magician. Four round trips with the rake was enough. A cupping followed, and O'Keeffe noted that, not surprisingly, the darker the roast the more intensely acidic and flavorful the coffee. Think of Starbucks' sharp and heavily roasted -- some say over-roasted -- product.
Winding down the mountain we happened upon La Casona de Doña Julia, two large barnlike structures with a sign reading "Comida Autenticamente Costarricense" (Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine). We sat at a long picnic table and sipped chilled Imperial, a Costa Rican beer. Actually, by the time it arrived it was only half chilled. A word about dining in Costa Rica restaurants: Service is slow, really slow, take-a-walk-between-courses slow.

A luxurious brew
If you're looking for a little opulence with your Arabica, it can be found half an hour from the airport at Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation Resort. It's snuggled amid 30 undulating acres of coffee -- everything is assiduously eco-friendly and sustainable -- with 13 tropically themed rooms and two suites (doubles around $350 with tax).
The daily 2 1/2-hour coffee program, which is open to non-guests with reservations ($40 per person), is as much about rainforest ecology and preservation as what you sip at breakfast. Those of an avian bent can roam the heavily shaded 30-acre property to seek out some of the nearly 250 species of tropical birds.
"We're all about being green and sustainable," said the farm supervisor and head roaster, Carlos Sanchez. "Even the hotel -- we built it with recyclable materials."
Our final stop was in the town of Naranjo, another short hop from the city, at the Espíritu Santo Coffee Tour. The coffee itinerary -- by now I could moonlight as a tour guide -- in a 600-acre plantation is unveiled in seven stages, from planting to merchandising. It can be a long lesson, but the engaging guides sense when to pick up the pace. And not least, they are great with children.
Hurtling through so many cups of coffee in four days was educational, O'Keeffe noted, as coffee, like wine, is a moving target -- and the tasting never stops.
This reminded O'Keeffe of a little story he sometimes pulls out of his wallet when in the presence of wine connoisseurs, about a television skit about wine tasting. "One actor said 'I taste raspberries!' and another said 'I taste pears, peaches, cherries!' and so forth," he said. When it came to the final actor, "He said, 'I taste crushed grapes.' It's like that with coffee tours."

Texto completo: There's an old Edwardian home in Pelham with strong ties to the nation's first president as well as its 34th, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The home, at 328 Cliff Ave., is now listed for sale for $2.688 million.
"When I put a house on the market I like to dig in and see what kind of history it has," said listing agent Arthur Scinta of Houlihan Lawrence.
Using just the address, he discovered that the house was owned by William E. Robinson, a New York Herald Tribune executive and later president of the Coca-Cola Company, in the 1940s and '50s. That led to Robinson's New York Times obituary and a 2014 Times article, "The Gang That Always Liked Ike" by presidential historian Michael Beschloss.
It turns out that Robinson and Eisenhower were quite close friends and golfing buddies for many years and that the president was a sometime guest in the house at 328 Cliff Ave. in Pelham.
Betty Bucher, who lived with her parents in a house across the street from the Robinsons, remembers seeing the president walk his Scottish terrier on the Cliff Avenue sidewalks one weekend, with Secret Service agents in tow.
"There was a lot of security," she said. "I remember three cars with Secret Service agents."
"Sometimes it's interesting and sometimes it's like, wow," said Scinta, about the results of his research into house histories. "This was a wow."
President George Washington was also a frequent overnight guest in an earlier house owned by Col. Philip Pell III (1753-1811) where the Cliff Avenue dwelling now stands.
The Pell house, which was built in 1750 and destroyed in 1888, "was exactly on the site where this house is now," Scinta said.
Pell was a descendant of Thomas Pell, the founder of Pelham and first "Lord of Pelham Manor." At that time. the Pells owned all of the present town of Pelham, Scinta said. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Pell served as deputy judge advocate general under Gen. Washington. He rode triumphantly with Washington into New York City the day the British evacuated the city at the end of the war, according to a 1946 history of Pelham by Lockwood Barr that Scinta describes as "the definitive history of Pelham."
"There was a very strong relationship between Pell and Washington," Scinta said. "He was his aide-de-camp."
After the war, Washington slept at the Pell home on "numerous occasions," according to Barr's book.
History aside, the 7,019-square-foot Cliff Avenue home, which has eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, "is about my favorite house in Pelham," Scinta said. Its 0.82-acre lot is particularly large for the village.
"This house literally takes your breath away," he said. "It's so architecturally distinct and with such great proportions – it's got an incredible feel to it."
Also, "it sits up really high," well above its neighbors, he said. "The Pells could have built anywhere and this is where they chose to build their house."
The first owner of the current house, which was built in 1914, was American Express President George C. Taylor, who bought the home in 1915, the year he was promoted to president of the company, Scinta said. He had joined the company as a wagon driver at age 17 and worked his way to the top.
At some point after the Robinsons lived there, the house was used as the Barbados United Nations embassy.
"I actually bought it from the Barbados government," said current owner Nicole Browning, who took ownership in 1995 and began a major renovation to uncover and restore all of the original woodwork that had been painted or otherwise covered.
The Cliff Avenue house is close to Pelham's downtown and its elementary and middle/high school, Scinta said. "The walkability factor is off the charts."
"You're three blocks from the train station, you have an acre, and you have all of this privacy," he said. "As big as it is, it has an intimate feel."
Browning agrees. "To me it's this beautiful house that's very gracious and wonderful for entertaining – it has amazing flow," she said. "But it's so cozy – it feels like a real family house."
She also loves the quick train ride into New York City.
"I go into the city, sometimes twice a day," Browning said. "Everybody loves Brooklyn these days, but this is such an easier commute."
Architecture and design details now include leaded glass windows, a formal dining room with a fireplace, restored hardware and woodwork throughout, and a well-maintained tile roof.
The kitchen has granite countertops, high-end stainless steel appliances, an island and a butler's pantry.
"The master bath is like a spa," Scinta said.
The house is entirely clad in period ceramic tile that's a "low-luster green color, and you never have to paint it," Scinta said.
Other amenities include a detached two-car garage with second-floor living quarters, six working fireplaces, central air conditioning, an exercise and recreation area on the lower level, and multiple patios.
Browning "has lovingly restored it, and they really brought it back to life," Scinta said. "Nicole has a wonderful sense of design."
She's also a great gardener, he said. "Something is always in bloom."
That seems to run in the family. Her sister is former Pelham resident Dominique Browning, the longtime editor of the now-defunct House & Garden magazine.
Who was William Robinson?
William Robinson, a longtime editor at the New York Herald Tribune, first met Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in 1944, during World War II, when he was in Europe to reestablish publication of the paper's European edition.
They remained close friends for life, through Eisenhower's two-term presidency and after he left office, until they both died in 1969, according to papers at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas.
In 1947, Robinson persuaded the general to write his war memoirs, "Crusade in Europe," and then arranged for their publication in book form by Doubleday and syndicated to newspapers worldwide by the Herald Tribune.
"The two men were drawn together by a great admiration and respect for each other's ideas and judgments, and an abiding common passion for playing bridge and golf," according to an introduction to the Robinson Papers at the Eisenhower Library.
Beginning in 1948, Robinson worked to convince the general to run for president and recruit supporters to the idea. Along with a handful of other wealthy businessmen, Robinson became part of an informal group of advisers to the future president that called themselves "the Gang." They were also his primary golfing buddies.
Early in 1952, Eisenhower's business cronies helped organize a highly successful midnight rally at Madison Square Garden, which nudged him toward a run for the presidency that year, according to a 2014 article in the New York Times by historian Michael Beschloss.
Serving in Paris at the time as supreme commander of NATO, Eisenhower saw a film of the two-hour rally and then told a friend, with tears in his eyes, "You can go tell Bill Robinson that I'm going to run," according to Beschloss.
After the election on Nov. 4, 1952, Robinson accompanied Eisenhower to Georgia to play golf at Augusta National Golf Club, according to the Eisenhower Library. At the time, Robinson was living in the Cliff Avenue house in Pelham. He lived there from 1946 until 1955, listing agent Arthur Scinta said.
"Mr. Robinson's intimate association with President Eisenhower continued during his two terms in office," according to the Eisenhower Library. Press accounts that describe how the president relaxed "always named Bill Robinson as one of President Eisenhower's closest personal friends in whose company he could temporarily find relief from the constant pressures and burdens of the presidency."

Texto completo: Seed for the project was planted not long after Tony Robichaux's death early last July, 10 days after the longtime Ragin' Cajuns baseball coach had a heart attack.
There was question over whether it was a good idea. There was doubt about how it would turn out. There was uncertainty over whether enough money could be raised to cover the cost.
In the end, the man who spearheaded the effort to honor his old coach – UL's only head baseball coach the past 25 seasons – couldn't have been happier about how things turned out.
"It's amazing when something like this comes together, and it comes together as you had envisioned it – and even better," former Cajuns pitcher Phil Devey said after the unveiling on a chilly morning Saturday of what was once just a thought in his mind, a larger than life statue of Robichaux that now stands in front of M.L. "Tigue" Moore Field at Russo Park.
The $160,000 project was funded solely by Robichaux's former players, with local businesses pitching in with gratis work on presentation and plaques accompanying the statue itself.
"It's just a testament to Coach Robe," said Devey, a Quebec native who played for Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics and made it to as high as the AAA level in pro ball. "It was easy for me and all the players to step up and get this done. It was a no-brainer.
"That's how much he meant to us, and to be able to do something ... for the family, and for our coach, (it's) something that's gonna stand the test of time."
Commissioned to create the statue was Brian Hanlon, a famed master sculptor from Toms River, New Jersey, whose portfolio of work includes a long rundown of who's who in the world of sports.
Shaquille O'Neal's and Skip Bertman's statue in Baton Rouge. The Steve Gleason "Rebirth" statue in New Orleans.
Statues of Yogi Berra and Bob Cousy and Jackie Robinson and Jim Brown and Evander Holyfield and Charles Barkley.
The list goes on and on, and it's not just sports figures.
Susan B. Antony. Harriet Tubman. Pope John Paul II.
Hanlon – who came from New Jersey to Lafayette for the unveiling – has had his hand in them all.
But this one, he suggested, was quite unlike some of the rest.
"My purpose always is to educate and inspire through these statues," Hanlon, dubbed the "Sports Rodin" in a 2018 New York Times article, said after the unveiling.
"We have profoundly done both things here, in a way, I think, that this monument, this historical marker, will continue to mentor young men. Which is ultimately what I got from Phil (Devey) – that he was profoundly impacted by his mentor.
"That's why I came all the way down here for this – because I was so enthralled by Phil's grassroots effort," Hanlon added. "This is unique."
Hanlon's inspiration was the players coached by Robichaux.
"Jobs are jobs," he said. "I've built over 550 statues in America, and some very, very famous people.
"I didn't go to some of those dedications – because during the process I was turned off by the process.
"This became better and better as we moved on, and I think it's the gift of grace," he added. "If that project and that person had that gift of grace, it comes through."
Also among those on hand for the unveiling in addition to fans, Robichaux's family members and scores of his current players were all the members of UL's current club, junior shortstop Hayden Cantrelle – a second generation Robichaux-coached Cajun – among them.
"It's goosebumps more than anything," Cantrelle said when asked recently what's going to go through his mind every time he was past the statue of his former coach.
"You know, we're playing a game. But what Coach Robe stood for was bigger than the game. So, seeing the statue is ... not gonna get old."
Cantrelle's father Kevin also played for Robichaux, who took UL to the 2000 College World Series and who was 57 when he died.
He figured the unveiling Saturday would be tough for all involved.
"We all expected that something like this, that a statue of Coach Robe, would be there," the elder Cantrelle said. "But it's just too soon."
Former UL second baseman Jace Conrad, who played for Robichaux's 58-10 NCAA Super Regional team in 2014, knows the feeling.
He was one of several ex-Cajuns who helped to organize fundraising efforts.
"There's no coach that has done more in the game of baseball for a group of men than Tony Robichaux," Conrad said.
"And you go around the country and will see some statues of coaches.
"But in my opinion, those statues are up there because of baseball," Conrad added. "And this statue is up there because of the life he lived and the example he set for the players he coached."
The inscription on the wall in front of Robichaux's statue suggests as much: "Don't hook your identity to a game," it reads, quoting Robichaux himself. "Let the way you live your life define who you are."
Quite appropriate.
The irony, however, is that the statue even exists.
"He was the last guy, you know – him looking down on us – I mean, he never wanted attention on himself," said Jeremy Talbot, a Robichaux assistant coach the last five seasons. "He'd probably be against it.
"But what an honor. What a privilege for us to be around a human being like that – a teacher, a mentor.
"You miss him, and you're sad," Talbot added, "but at the same time, when I look at that statue, I'm going to look at it with tremendous pride and a heart of gratitude that I was able to be in his life for a short time and pick up on some of his wisdom."
So the statue stands, whether Robichaux likes it or not.
As it should, those influenced by him most firmly believe.
"You know," senior centerfielder Brennan Breaux said, "the fraternity of alumni players here is unlike anywhere in the country, and all of those guys, for the most part, were led by that one guy that they're gonna build a statue of.
"And Coach always said, 'They don't build a statue of critics. They build statues of guys that separate themselves and go above and beyond their call of duty.' And Coach did that."
PLATE PROBLEMS COST CAJUNS
The pitching and defense are just fine.
But Saturday marked another rough day at the plate for the No. 24 UL baseball team, now 0-2 after Saturday's 2-1 loss to Louisiana Tech on M.L. "Tigue" Moore Field.
Hayden Cantrelle's fourth-inning homer to left that tied the game 1-1 was the only hit of the day for the Ragin' Cajuns, who struck out 16 times in Friday's 3-2 Opening Night loss to Southeastern Louisiana.
"It's a lot of spins, a lot of weak early outs," UL coach Matt Deggs said. "It's a lot of them using us against us, a lot of poor pitch selection – which all comes with pressing and carrying at-bats with you to the dish.
"It's kind of every man for himself, and it just doesn't work that way with what we do. It never has."
Louisiana Tech went up for good when Alex Ray scored on Parker Bates' fifth-inning RBI single.
Bulldog pitchers retired the last 16 straight Cajun batters, with Jonathan Fincher working 6.0 innings and Kyle Crigger getting the save with 3.0 shutout innings.
"We've got to get better," Deggs said. "Right now we're not very good offensively. We can be. I've seen it.
"My eyes haven't lied to me in 25 years of this game, and I can just tell you: We've got a chance to be good offensively."
Cantrelle isn't worried either, and put some of it on stress that's come with UL playing for the first time since longtime coach Tony Robichaux died last July.
"There's a lot of nerves. It's been a very emotional weekend so far," the junior shortstop. "Of course that's not an excuse. But part of the game is handling those emotions."

Texto completo: There's an old Edwardian home in Pelham with strong ties to the nation's first president as well as its 34th, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The home, at 328 Cliff Ave., is now listed for sale for $2.688 million. "When I put a house on the market I like to dig in and see what kind of history it has," said listing agent Arthur Scinta of Houlihan Lawrence. Using just the address, he discovered that the house was owned by William E. Robinson, a New York Herald Tribune executive and later president of the Coca-Cola Company, in the 1940s and '50s. That led to Robinson's New York Times obituary and a 2014 Times article, "The Gang That Always Liked Ike" by presidential historian Michael Beschloss.
It turns out that Robinson and Eisenhower were quite close friends and golfing buddies for many years and that the president was a sometime guest in the house at 328 Cliff Ave. in Pelham.
Betty Bucher, who lived with her parents in a house across the street from the Robinsons, remembers seeing the president walk his Scottish terrier on the Cliff Avenue sidewalks one weekend, with Secret Service agents in tow.
"There was a lot of security," she said. "I remember three cars with Secret Service agents."
"Sometimes it's interesting and sometimes it's like, wow," said Scinta, about the results of his research into house histories. "This was a wow."
President George Washington was also a frequent overnight guest in an earlier house owned by Col. Philip Pell III (1753-1811) where the Cliff Avenue dwelling now stands.
The Pell house, which was built in 1750 and destroyed in 1888, "was exactly on the site where this house is now," Scinta said.
Pell was a descendant of Thomas Pell, the founder of Pelham and first "Lord of Pelham Manor." At that time. the Pells owned all of the present town of Pelham, Scinta said. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Pell served as deputy judge advocate general under Gen. Washington. He rode triumphantly with Washington into New York City the day the British evacuated the city at the end of the war, according to a 1946 history of Pelham by Lockwood Barr that Scinta describes as "the definitive history of Pelham."
"There was a very strong relationship between Pell and Washington," Scinta said. "He was his aide-de-camp."
After the war, Washington slept at the Pell home on "numerous occasions," according to Barr's book.
History aside, the 7,019-square-foot Cliff Avenue home, which has eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, "is about my favorite house in Pelham," Scinta said. Its 0.82-acre lot is particularly large for the village.
"This house literally takes your breath away," he said. "It's so architecturally distinct and with such great proportions – it's got an incredible feel to it."
Also, "it sits up really high," well above its neighbors, he said. "The Pells could have built anywhere and this is where they chose to build their house."
The first owner of the current house, which was built in 1914, was American Express President George C. Taylor, who bought the home in 1915, the year he was promoted to president of the company, Scinta said. He had joined the company as a wagon driver at age 17 and worked his way to the top.
At some point after the Robinsons lived there, the house was used as the Barbados United Nations embassy.
"I actually bought it from the Barbados government," said current owner Nicole Browning, who took ownership in 1995 and began a major renovation to uncover and restore all of the original woodwork that had been painted or otherwise covered.
The Cliff Avenue house is close to Pelham's downtown and its elementary and middle/high school, Scinta said. "The walkability factor is off the charts."
"You're three blocks from the train station, you have an acre, and you have all of this privacy," he said. "As big as it is, it has an intimate feel."
Browning agrees. "To me it's this beautiful house that's very gracious and wonderful for entertaining – it has amazing flow," she said. "But it's so cozy – it feels like a real family house."
She also loves the quick train ride into New York City.
"I go into the city, sometimes twice a day," Browning said. "Everybody loves Brooklyn these days, but this is such an easier commute."
Architecture and design details now include leaded glass windows, a formal dining room with a fireplace, restored hardware and woodwork throughout, and a well-maintained tile roof.
The kitchen has granite countertops, high-end stainless steel appliances, an island and a butler's pantry.
"The master bath is like a spa," Scinta said.
The house is entirely clad in period ceramic tile that's a "low-luster green color, and you never have to paint it," Scinta said.
Other amenities include a detached two-car garage with second-floor living quarters, six working fireplaces, central air conditioning, an exercise and recreation area on the lower level, and multiple patios.
Browning "has lovingly restored it, and they really brought it back to life," Scinta said. "Nicole has a wonderful sense of design."
She's also a great gardener, he said. "Something is always in bloom."
That seems to run in the family. Her sister is former Pelham resident Dominique Browning, the longtime editor of the now-defunct House & Garden magazine.
Who was William Robinson?
William Robinson, a longtime editor at the New York Herald Tribune, first met Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in 1944, during World War II, when he was in Europe to reestablish publication of the paper's European edition.
They remained close friends for life, through Eisenhower's two-term presidency and after he left office, until they both died in 1969, according to papers at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas.
In 1947, Robinson persuaded the general to write his war memoirs, "Crusade in Europe," and then arranged for their publication in book form by Doubleday and syndicated to newspapers worldwide by the Herald Tribune.
"The two men were drawn together by a great admiration and respect for each other's ideas and judgments, and an abiding common passion for playing bridge and golf," according to an introduction to the Robinson Papers at the Eisenhower Library.
Beginning in 1948, Robinson worked to convince the general to run for president and recruit supporters to the idea. Along with a handful of other wealthy businessmen, Robinson became part of an informal group of advisers to the future president that called themselves "the Gang." They were also his primary golfing buddies.
Early in 1952, Eisenhower's business cronies helped organize a highly successful midnight rally at Madison Square Garden, which nudged him toward a run for the presidency that year, according to a 2014 article in the New York Times by historian Michael Beschloss.
Serving in Paris at the time as supreme commander of NATO, Eisenhower saw a film of the two-hour rally and then told a friend, with tears in his eyes, "You can go tell Bill Robinson that I'm going to run," according to Beschloss.
After the election on Nov. 4, 1952, Robinson accompanied Eisenhower to Georgia to play golf at Augusta National Golf Club, according to the Eisenhower Library. At the time, Robinson was living in the Cliff Avenue house in Pelham. He lived there from 1946 until 1955, listing agent Arthur Scinta said.
"Mr. Robinson's intimate association with President Eisenhower continued during his two terms in office," according to the Eisenhower Library. Press accounts that describe how the president relaxed "always named Bill Robinson as one of President Eisenhower's closest personal friends in whose company he could temporarily find relief from the constant pressures and burdens of the presidency."

Why has the GOP stopped its complaints about the deficit?

Texto completo: I spent 24 years working in the Senate before leaving in 2010. I heard more floor speeches and sat through more committee hearings and discussions than I care to remember.
But I do remember one constant in all those years. Whenever and wherever the subject came up, you could depend on any Republican in sight to pontificate on fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget.
That was somewhat less so when there was a Republican president and they could concentrate on their other favorite subject — cutting taxes. But even then, they cited supply-side economic theory, insisting the tax cuts would pay for themselves and they were still deficit hawks.
What happened? I follow Congress fairly closely, and I can't recall any Republican talking about balancing the budget in the past few months.
Yet we have witnessed the most extraordinary fiscal event in my memory — an unprecedented budget deficit created, not to combat a recession, but during a prolonged period of economic expansion.
Here's what the Associated Press just reported:
"The U.S. budget deficit through the first three months of this budget year is up 11.8% from the same period a year ago, putting the country on track to record its first $1 trillion deficit in eight years.
"In its monthly budget report, the Treasury Department said Monday that the deficit from October through December totaled $356.6 billion up from $318.9 billion for the same period last year.
"Both government spending and revenues set records for the first three months of this budget year, but spending rose at a faster clip than tax collections, pushing the deficit total up.
"The Congressional Budget Office is projecting that the deficit for the current 2020 budget year will hit $1 trillion and remain over $1 trillion for the next decade. The country has not experienced $1 trillion annual deficits since the period from 2009 through 2012 following the 2008 financial crisis."
Back in my Senate days, numbers like that would have set Rand Paul's or Ted Cruz's hair on fire. But the reason they have been silent is too obvious.
The AP went on to say:
"The projections of trillion-dollar deficits are in contrast to Trump's campaign promise of 2016 that even with his proposed tax cuts, he would be able to eliminate future deficits with cuts in spending and growth in revenues that would result from a stronger economy."
You can't envy the political problems Congressional Republicans face in 2020.
After decades of talk of their party's fiscal responsibility, they suddenly have to defend exactly the opposite.
As the New York Times just reported, "The widening deficit under Mr. Trump shows the degree to which economic growth on his watch has been helped by fiscal stimulus — increased borrowing by the government that injects more money into the consumer economy. That combination is unusual for a growing economy with low unemployment. In recent periods in the United States, sustained economic expansions have brought deficits down."
Recent polling data from Pew Research Poll indicates this could be a major issue in this campaign year.
The poll found that 53% of Americans view the federal budget deficit as a "very big" problem facing the country. That's a larger share of the public than the portion that views terrorism (39%), racism (43%), or climate change (48%) as a major problem. Indeed, the only topics that score higher in the Pew poll are drug addiction and the affordability of health care and college educations.
Despite the fact that the last time the federal government had a balanced budget was under President Clinton, Democrats have always been on the defensive when campaigning Republicans raged about balanced budgets.
Not this year.
I'm looking forward to how they explain what has happened, and how it happened when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress.
I confess. I feel a bit of what the Germans call schadenfreude.

Texto completo: Russia is expected to drop into second place in the gold medal count for the 2014 Winter Olympics after sports officials on Saturday disqualified a biathlon winner for testing positive for a steroid, the New York Times reported.
If upheld by the International Olympic Committee and on expected appeals, the ruling would signify the final unraveling of a Russian effort to dominate medal counts by cheating with a state-sponsored doping program.
The International Biathlon Union ruled that Evgeny Ustyugov, who competed in a gold-medal-winning relay team, had used a banned steroid during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. "The consequences include the disqualification of Mr. Ustyugov's results from the Olympic Games 2014, in which he won a gold medal," the group said.
Fallout from the doping program has cut the number of Russian medals won at the 2014 games the country hosted. The supremacy in gold medals in Sochi has been a point of national pride.
College football: A former Wisconsin football player who is the brother of a 2011 Super Bowl standout surrendered to Chicago police in connection with the deaths of two people who were found with gunshot wounds on a Wisconsin road and later died. Marcus Randle El, 33, was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Randle El's brother, Antwaan Randle El, was a star QB at Indiana and spent nine years with the NFL, including as a receiver for the Steelers.
Football: The agent for Steelers QB Mason Rudolph says Browns DE Myles Garrett opened himself up for potential legal action after reiterating his claim that Rudolph used a racial slur shortly before their infamous November brawl. Garrett was reinstated after an indefinite suspension last week.
Golf: Seven-time major champion Inbee Park of South Korea took a three-stroke lead at the Women's Australian Open in Adelaide, Australia, after carding a 5-under 68.
Soccer: French league leader Paris Saint-Germain settled for a 4-4 draw at Amiens. PSG trailed 3-0 and led 4-3 before conceding an injury-time equalizer.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Texto completo: Russia is expected to drop into second place in the gold medal count for the 2014 Winter Olympics after sports officials on Saturday disqualified a biathlon winner for testing positive for a steroid, the New York Times reported.
If upheld by the International Olympic Committee and on expected appeals, the ruling would signify the final unraveling of a Russian effort to dominate medal counts by cheating with a state-sponsored doping program.
The International Biathlon Union ruled that Evgeny Ustyugov, who competed in a gold-medal-winning relay team, had used a banned steroid during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. "The consequences include the disqualification of Mr. Ustyugov's results from the Olympic Games 2014, in which he won a gold medal," the group said.
Fallout from the doping program has cut the number of Russian medals won at the 2014 games the country hosted. The supremacy in gold medals in Sochi has been a point of national pride.
College football: A former Wisconsin football player who is the brother of a 2011 Super Bowl standout surrendered to Chicago police in connection with the deaths of two people who were found with gunshot wounds on a Wisconsin road and later died. Marcus Randle El, 33, was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Randle El's brother, Antwaan Randle El, was a star QB at Indiana and spent nine years with the NFL, including as a receiver for the Steelers.
Football: The agent for Steelers QB Mason Rudolph says Browns DE Myles Garrett opened himself up for potential legal action after reiterating his claim that Rudolph used a racial slur shortly before their infamous November brawl. Garrett was reinstated after an indefinite suspension last week.
Golf: Seven-time major champion Inbee Park of South Korea took a three-stroke lead at the Women's Australian Open in Adelaide, Australia, after carding a 5-under 68.

2K years of secrets hide in Thames Mudlarks scour river for artifacts from eras past

Texto completo: LONDON - On a finger numbingly cold morning, Lara Maiklem swung open a metal gate tucked behind a pub in southeast London and scrambled down a set of slick stone steps onto the banks of the River Thames.
The river runs through the city west to east, bisecting London as it winds past the new skyscrapers and old docks that line its banks.
But twice a day, the low tide pulls the flowing edges of the Thames back - dropping the river level by 20 feet in some areas - revealing centuries of forgotten London life in the fragments that poke out from the newly exposed land, known as the foreshore.
This is when the mudlarks, like Maiklem, come out.
"What you are looking for are straight lines and perfect circles," she said, her eyes scanning the surface of the mud for man-made artifacts. "They sort of stand out from the natural shapes."
Within minutes she had spotted fragments of a 17th-century jug, the half-face of a bearded man visible in the clay.
The name - mudlark - was first given to the Victorian-era poor who scrounged for items in the river to sell, pulling copper scraps, rope and other valuables from the shore. But more recently the label has stuck to London's hobbyists, history buffs and treasure hunters who scour the river edge searching for objects from the city's past.
Mudlarking's popularity has grown steadily in recent years, driven in part by social media communities in which enthusiasts share their finds and tour groups that offer a trudge through the shards of history's castoffs.
Dr. Fiona Haughey, a London archaeologist who has worked on the Thames since the 1990s, said that although some mudlarks are looking for valuables, others are looking for a connection with the everyday objects of a bygone Britain.
But it's the connection with the layers of lives of Londoners before them, revealed by the tides of the river at the heart of the metropolis, that unites the enthusiasts.
For Haughey, a specialist in prehistory, it's about what an object can tell her about its owner rather than what value it has.
"I love the conundrum of it," she said.
The Port of London Authority, which owns the Thames waterway along with the Crown Estate (i.e. Queen Elizabeth II), began to regulate exploration along the shore in 2016, requiring anyone searching the banks to have a foreshore permit.
These permits - about 1,500 were issued this year - allow people to explore the terrain, and scrape or dig into the mud up to a depth of around 3 inches. Mudlarks are advised to report objects that could be of archaeological interest to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, run by the British Museum.
Stuart Wyatt, the regional finds liaison officer based at the Museum of London who assesses the artifacts, said there was a "huge increase in numbers" of mudlarks in recent years.
"I now have months where I see only new finders," he said by email.
Britain legally obligates anyone who unearths "treasure" - defined as single finds of gold and silver over 300 years old, and hoards of coins and prehistoric metalwork - to inform the government.
Britain takes this law seriously, as one amateur treasure hunter learned in November. He was given a decadelong jail sentence after failing, along with another man, to report the discovery of a Viking hoard they dug up in western England.
A specialized permit allows deeper digging to a depth of nearly 4 feet. But those permits are available only to members of the exclusive Society of Thames Mudlarks - an invitation-only group of around 50 members - who have already held a standard permit and reported their findings to the Museum of London for two years.
Some mudlarks bring metal detectors. But most simply recover what the river has naturally revealed, usually a fascinating trinket rather than treasure.
"I like just to collect what the river decides it's going to leave on that day," Maiklem said. "It's that element of luck."
But sometimes there are more significant finds, like the first "spintria" found in Britain. Spintriae are Roman bronze tokens, with depictions of sexual acts on one face and a Roman numeral on the other, whose purpose remains uncertain.
And every tide reveals some of the city's varied story: Roman coins, medieval badges worn by religious pilgrims, an elaborate 17th-century watch.
The Thames, the very reason people began settling in the city over 2,000 years ago, is one of the best preservers of London's history. The river has been used many ways over the millenniums - as a highway, a source of food and, most important to mudlarks, as a dump.
"The Thames is unpredictable, so its just all mixed up, like a big washing machine," said Jason Sandy, an architect who mudlarks in his spare time.
In the center of London, where the heart of the Roman city stood, many of the finds are Roman or medieval. Farther west, evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found.
Where Maiklem was exploring, in Rotherhithe, once an old shipping center in eastern London, finds from the 16th and 17th centuries are the norm.
This particular morning, the sun was just rising and the tide was still on its way out as she clambered over rocks.
Her eyes flicked quickly over the mud, scattered with bits of modern trash, and settled on the barely visible edge of a coin nestled against a wooden post. She plucked it out and wiped away the grime, revealing a George III farthing, the silhouetted face of the monarch and the date, 1777, nearly rubbed smooth.
The coin had been bent into an "S" shape and had a small hole poked through its edge where a chain could be attached, hallmarks that it was likely a love token. At her feet, pieces of clay tobacco pipes from the 16th and 17th century clinked as they washed against rocks, so common as to escape a mudlark's interest.
But a perfectly round musket ball was worth plucking from the muck. The leather sole of a hand-stitched shoe, preserved by the anaerobic mud, flapped in the breeze, and she tugged at its toes to wrest it from the bank. Huge wooden beams from the ships broken up here in the 17th and 18th centuries jut out of the mud.
The Mayflower is believed to have been broken down here for scrap.
"There are so many ghosts locked in the foreshore," Maiklem said. "Also, it's so fleeting because if it's not collected from the surface, it's going to be washed away or broken down."

Texto completo: There's an old Edwardian home in Pelham with strong ties to the nation's first president as well as its 34th, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The home, at 328 Cliff Ave., is now listed for sale for $2.688 million. "When I put a house on the market I like to dig in and see what kind of history it has," said listing agent Arthur Scinta of Houlihan Lawrence. Using just the address, he discovered that the house was owned by William E. Robinson, a New York Herald Tribune executive and later president of the Coca-Cola Company, in the 1940s and '50s. That led to Robinson's New York Times obituary and a 2014 Times article, "The Gang That Always Liked Ike" by presidential historian Michael Beschloss.
It turns out that Robinson and Eisenhower were quite close friends and golfing buddies for many years and that the president was a sometime guest in the house at 328 Cliff Ave. in Pelham.
Betty Bucher, who lived with her parents in a house across the street from the Robinsons, remembers seeing the president walk his Scottish terrier on the Cliff Avenue sidewalks one weekend, with Secret Service agents in tow.
"There was a lot of security," she said. "I remember three cars with Secret Service agents."
"Sometimes it's interesting and sometimes it's like, wow," said Scinta, about the results of his research into house histories. "This was a wow."
President George Washington was also a frequent overnight guest in an earlier house owned by Col. Philip Pell III (1753-1811) where the Cliff Avenue dwelling now stands.
The Pell house, which was built in 1750 and destroyed in 1888, "was exactly on the site where this house is now," Scinta said.
Pell was a descendant of Thomas Pell, the founder of Pelham and first "Lord of Pelham Manor." At that time. the Pells owned all of the present town of Pelham, Scinta said. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Pell served as deputy judge advocate general under Gen. Washington. He rode triumphantly with Washington into New York City the day the British evacuated the city at the end of the war, according to a 1946 history of Pelham by Lockwood Barr that Scinta describes as "the definitive history of Pelham."
"There was a very strong relationship between Pell and Washington," Scinta said. "He was his aide-de-camp."
After the war, Washington slept at the Pell home on "numerous occasions," according to Barr's book.
History aside, the 7,019-square-foot Cliff Avenue home, which has eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, "is about my favorite house in Pelham," Scinta said. Its 0.82-acre lot is particularly large for the village.
"This house literally takes your breath away," he said. "It's so architecturally distinct and with such great proportions – it's got an incredible feel to it."
Also, "it sits up really high," well above its neighbors, he said. "The Pells could have built anywhere and this is where they chose to build their house."
The first owner of the current house, which was built in 1914, was American Express President George C. Taylor, who bought the home in 1915, the year he was promoted to president of the company, Scinta said. He had joined the company as a wagon driver at age 17 and worked his way to the top.
At some point after the Robinsons lived there, the house was used as the Barbados United Nations embassy.
"I actually bought it from the Barbados government," said current owner Nicole Browning, who took ownership in 1995 and began a major renovation to uncover and restore all of the original woodwork that had been painted or otherwise covered.
The Cliff Avenue house is close to Pelham's downtown and its elementary and middle/high school, Scinta said. "The walkability factor is off the charts."
"You're three blocks from the train station, you have an acre, and you have all of this privacy," he said. "As big as it is, it has an intimate feel."
Browning agrees. "To me it's this beautiful house that's very gracious and wonderful for entertaining – it has amazing flow," she said. "But it's so cozy – it feels like a real family house."
She also loves the quick train ride into New York City.
"I go into the city, sometimes twice a day," Browning said. "Everybody loves Brooklyn these days, but this is such an easier commute."
Architecture and design details now include leaded glass windows, a formal dining room with a fireplace, restored hardware and woodwork throughout, and a well-maintained tile roof.
The kitchen has granite countertops, high-end stainless steel appliances, an island and a butler's pantry.
"The master bath is like a spa," Scinta said.
The house is entirely clad in period ceramic tile that's a "low-luster green color, and you never have to paint it," Scinta said.
Other amenities include a detached two-car garage with second-floor living quarters, six working fireplaces, central air conditioning, an exercise and recreation area on the lower level, and multiple patios.
Browning "has lovingly restored it, and they really brought it back to life," Scinta said. "Nicole has a wonderful sense of design."
She's also a great gardener, he said. "Something is always in bloom."
That seems to run in the family. Her sister is former Pelham resident Dominique Browning, the longtime editor of the now-defunct House & Garden magazine.
Who was William Robinson?
William Robinson, a longtime editor at the New York Herald Tribune, first met Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in 1944, during World War II, when he was in Europe to reestablish publication of the paper's European edition.
They remained close friends for life, through Eisenhower's two-term presidency and after he left office, until they both died in 1969, according to papers at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas.
In 1947, Robinson persuaded the general to write his war memoirs, "Crusade in Europe," and then arranged for their publication in book form by Doubleday and syndicated to newspapers worldwide by the Herald Tribune.
"The two men were drawn together by a great admiration and respect for each other's ideas and judgments, and an abiding common passion for playing bridge and golf," according to an introduction to the Robinson Papers at the Eisenhower Library.
Beginning in 1948, Robinson worked to convince the general to run for president and recruit supporters to the idea. Along with a handful of other wealthy businessmen, Robinson became part of an informal group of advisers to the future president that called themselves "the Gang." They were also his primary golfing buddies.
Early in 1952, Eisenhower's business cronies helped organize a highly successful midnight rally at Madison Square Garden, which nudged him toward a run for the presidency that year, according to a 2014 article in the New York Times by historian Michael Beschloss.
Serving in Paris at the time as supreme commander of NATO, Eisenhower saw a film of the two-hour rally and then told a friend, with tears in his eyes, "You can go tell Bill Robinson that I'm going to run," according to Beschloss.
After the election on Nov. 4, 1952, Robinson accompanied Eisenhower to Georgia to play golf at Augusta National Golf Club, according to the Eisenhower Library. At the time, Robinson was living in the Cliff Avenue house in Pelham. He lived there from 1946 until 1955, listing agent Arthur Scinta said.
"Mr. Robinson's intimate association with President Eisenhower continued during his two terms in office," according to the Eisenhower Library. Press accounts that describe how the president relaxed "always named Bill Robinson as one of President Eisenhower's closest personal friends in whose company he could temporarily find relief from the constant pressures and burdens of the presidency."

Texto completo: Editor's note: The Enquirer Board of Contributors is a group of local citizens of different backgrounds and political philosophies selected by The Enquirer to write an op-ed once a month on a topic of their choosing.
I won the lottery!
Well, not really – but I feel as if I did.
You know the feeling – giddy, gushing with joy and ready to tell anyone and everyone the news.
That's how I feel today because I've been appointed to The Enquirer's Board of Contributors.
Little known fact: I'm a newspaper junkie.
As a kid growing up in Brooklyn, we had seven dailies – all delivered to our home. The Herald Tribune, New York Times, Daily News, Daily Mirror, New York Post, Brooklyn Eagle and Journal American.
Yikes – where have they gone?
What has happened to my beloved daily newspaper?
Work for the New York Post – the best sports section in the country – that's all I ever wanted to do.
And I did. I think it was like a submission hold in wrestling. They tapped out.
I wrote a letter-a-day to then Sports Editor Ike Gellis – and during my junior year in college he broke and called – I answered.
And worked as a clerk from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. – five days a week.
Wow – that sports department was like the New York Yankees "Murderer's Row."
Larry Merchant and Dr. Z. – Paul Zimmerman – were the columnists. Maury Allen covered the Yankees and after the All-Star break switched to the Mets.
Steve Serby, who covers the NFL today was on the high school beat.
No computers back then – in fact, my job was to tape stories, then type and transcribe them.
No problem – a true labor of love.
I moved to the Brooklyn Graphic – a weekly – then to the Daily Eagle – and created a Scholastic Roundup notes column. It proved to be a hit in the borough that housed some 24 high schools.
I'd mention alums and where they may have continued their sporting careers – and, of course send the clips cross-country after they appeared in print.
A kid by the name of Arthur (Stretch) Graham played for Brooklyn's Lafayette High and continued at Oral Roberts University. I wrote about him and, of course, sent the story to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Athletic Director Bob Brooks was impressed. He flew me to Tulsa, and I left newspapers to become the sports information man for the late Rev. Roberts' school.
Yes, I still love newspapers. I wake up to four dailies in my driveway – besides The Enquirer – the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The New York Times.
My hopes are that those half my age will have their juices flow with newspapers as well.
And someday they too, will have the opportunity to write in this space.
Thank you.

Veterans Affairs faces turmoil again Firing of deputy secretary latest in string of incidents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later - or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.
Caption: For men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle may lower the later risk of developing heart disease by more than 80 percent.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Texto completo: Russia is expected to drop into second place in the gold medal count for the 2014 Winter Olympics after sports officials on Saturday disqualified a biathlon winner for testing positive for a steroid, the New York Times reported.
If upheld by the International Olympic Committee and on expected appeals, the ruling would signify the final unraveling of a Russian effort to dominate medal counts by cheating with a state-sponsored doping program.
The International Biathlon Union ruled that Evgeny Ustyugov, who competed in a gold-medal-winning relay team, had used a banned steroid during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. "The consequences include the disqualification of Mr. Ustyugov's results from the Olympic Games 2014, in which he won a gold medal," the group said.
Fallout from the doping program has cut the number of Russian medals won at the 2014 games the country hosted. The supremacy in gold medals in Sochi has been a point of national pride, as high Olympic medal counts have long been for Russia and the Soviet Union.
Football: The agent for Steelers QB Mason Rudolph says Browns DE Myles Garrett opened himself up for potential legal action after reiterating his claim that Rudolph used a racial slur shortly before their infamous November brawl. Garrett was reinstated after an indefinite suspension by commissioner Roger Goddell last week.
Golf: Seven-time major champion Inbee Park of South Korea took a three-stroke lead at the Women's Australian Open in Adelaide, Australia, after carding a 5-under 68, including a 40-foot birdie putt on 18.
Soccer: French league leader Paris Saint-Germain's collapsed in a 4-4 draw at Amiens. PSG trailed 3-0 and then led 4-3 before conceding an injury-time equalizer to Serhou Guirassy for his second goal of the game.
Tennis: Swiss qualifier Leonie Kung topped Japan's Nao Hibino in the semifinals of the Thailand Open, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. ... Eighth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway won 10 of the last 11 games to beat Argentina's Juan Ignacio Londero 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 and advance to the final of the Argentina Open.

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

A publishing 'crisis' and controversy over 'American Dirt' issues in publishing

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Long before Jeanine Cummins' highly contentious "American Dirt" was published by Flatiron Books, the novel was raising red flags internally, according to Myriam Gurba.
"I've spoken to people who work in Flatiron who have told me that the book was identified as problematic from the get-go," Gurba alleged, speaking before a packed room Feb. 6 at a panel discussion organized by her new group, #DignidadLiteraria. "And people's critiques were either dismissed or they felt coerced into being silent. ... They knew that this could happen and they went through with it anyway."
Flatiron, a division of Macmillan Publishing, did not immediately respond to a Times request for comment.
Gurba's negative review of the novel became the catalyst for one of the biggest controversies in U.S. publishing in recent years. The event, in Culver City, drew about 100 people. In a nod to the #OwnVoices movement, dozens of books by people of color were on display near the back. A diverse audience of activists, book sellers, professors, writers and other community members filled seats or stood along the perimeter, occasionally nodding, clapping and murmuring in agreement over panelists' remarks.
The event - with Gurba, Roxane Gay, Romeo Guzman, Wendy C. Ortiz and Christopher Soto - was part of #DignidadLiteraria's national week of action, a series of town halls to discuss Latinx visibility in the U.S. It was the first panel to be held since authors and #DignidadLiteraria founders Gurba, David Bowles and Roberto Lovato met with Macmillan publishers and others Feb. 3 to discuss steps the imprint can take to amplify Latinx voices in the industry.
During the meeting in New York, Macmillan committed to increasing its number of Latinx staff, authors and titles and to changing the "overall ecosystem." It also vowed to develop an action plan to address those goals within 90 days and to regroup with the cohort in 30 days to evaluate progress.
Responding to Gurba's claim that Flatiron ignored red flags, Gay said she believes the publisher will continue to dismiss them because "American Dirt" is selling so well, having debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times Bestsellers list.
"This woman is going to be set for life, this book is going to earn royalties in perpetuity, and so it just reinforces what publishing already knows, which is as long as white people are translating the experiences of people of color, it will sell very well," said Gay, the bestselling author of "Hunger" and "Bad Feminist" (both published by HarperCollins, one of the "Big Five" U.S. publishers).
Gay appeared in her capacity as the editor of Ortiz's article on the topic, "Adventures in Publishing Outside the Gates," in her online journal, Gay Mag.
The wide-ranging discussion coalesced around a couple of flashpoints. One was panelists' differences with white feminists.
Ortiz recounted the negative reactions she's received after publishing her essay, which called out the similarities between her 2014 memoir, "Excavation," and Kate Elizabeth Russell's forthcoming, highly anticipated and heavily promoted novel "My Dark Vanessa."
"Excavation" is about the five-year sexual relationship between the teenage Ortiz and her eighth-grade English teacher. "My Dark Vanessa," for which Russell received a seven-figure advance, tells a similar story: A 17-year-old girl confronts the sexual relationship she had with her English teacher when she was 15 after another student accuses him of sexual abuse.
Ortiz said some critical responses have taken the form of "racism ... cloaked in white feminism."
Gay said it has been white women who've rallied to defend Russell against Ortiz, who has called the book "a fictional take on a reality I lived." (On the panel, Ortiz denied that she had ever alleged plagiarism.)
Gay said accusations of professional envy and demands for apologies of the kind that dogged Ortiz are common. "We see this a lot in online discourse where people see something that triggers or upsets them, and they worry that it could happen to them someday. So they get behind whoever they perceive is the biggest victim, and it's always going to be the white woman."
The panelists also discussed whether it was better to use small presses when the corporate gatekeepers failed to embrace them.
Gurba said #DignidadLiteraria had suggested during the Macmillan meeting that the publisher start a Latinx imprint. "We gave them basically a business model for it ... (but) they didn't even want to touch the paper. ... Mexican Americans are scary people!" she said, laughing.
Moderator Xochitl-Julisa Bermejo asked the panelists how people of color can hold big publishers accountable while also supporting small presses.
Gay advised people to keep raising their voices. "The only reason Macmillan responded is because the backlash was so significant and so concentrated and it has not gone away," she said. "That just shows that when we speak up as people of color, it actually does something when we do it in numbers."
She emphasized that supporting small publishing isn't always the sole answer because it "lets big publishing off the hook," and it doesn't change the fact that the Big Five control the vast majority of the books we get to read. Gay encouraged consumers to educate themselves about what's happening in small presses and "make one of every three book purchases a small-press book, if not more."
In any event, she was skeptical of the common complaint that the publishing industry is declining and in need of support. "Big publishing is going to be OK."

Texto completo: In Connecticut, where gun violence prevention has been a major issue since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's strong record on the issue will likely resonate with a wide swath of voters in the April Democratic presidential primary.
"What [Bloomberg] has done is not only advocate gun violence prevention, but also he has literally put his money where his mouth is," said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who has not made an endorsement in the primary. "He has been enormously strategic and successful in channeling resources to build a grassroots organization and demand action."
On the issue of gun safety, Bloomberg has deep credentials. He cofounded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006; it has since merged with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to become the nonprofit gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.
In a recent digital ad that appeared online across Connecticut, Bloomberg's campaign touted his record on guns and made a direct connection to Sandy Hook. The ad featured Mary Ann Jacob, a librarian who survived the shooting and, along with colleagues, has been credited with saving 18 kids by hiding them in a supply closet and blocking the library doors with a filing cabinet.
"When the [gun control] legislation in Congress failed, it made me wonder if anybody in Washington cared," Jacob says in the ad. "No one else was able to step in and do what Mike has done, and you know what? That's made all the difference in the world."
"I think he's got a proven track record," said state Rep. Christopher Rosario, a Bridgeport Democrat who is a co-chair of Bloomberg's campaign in Connecticut. "I know the issue gets amplified because you hear situations like Sandy Hook and Parkland, but we can't forget about urban gun violence, where you may have shootings that may not necessarily have happened on school grounds or in the school but that happen around the school, which is something that impacts a place like Bridgeport."
In Connecticut, like the rest of the U.S., gun control has remained a deeply partisan issue. A 2019 Pew Research Center Survey found that while the percentage of Americans who support stricter gun laws has increased from 52% to 60% since 2017, only 31% of Republicans share that viewpoint.
Bloomberg, who is ramping up his efforts in Connecticut, is running on a platform that includes banning assault weapons, stronger background checks for gun buyers, greater oversight of gun show and internet sales and several other strategies, many of which have also been adopted by his Democratic rivals.
As a result, some state leaders, including U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, say they don't believe gun safety will make much of a difference in how Connecticut voters choose a candidate in the April 28 primary.
"I've never thought that the issue of gun violence was going to be a deciding factor in the Democratic primary because there's not a lot of differences [among the candidates]," Murphy said. "The issue of guns is going to be a deciding factor in the general election, because over the last four years, voters have come to the conclusion they don't want to elect people who are in lockstep with the NRA. And Donald Trump is, unfortunately, in lockstep with the NRA."
Since the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, which Bloomberg largely avoided, the self-made billionaire trails only Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden nationally, according to a RealClear Politics' average of leading polls.
But Bloomberg has been widely criticized for his "stop-and-frisk" legacy of policing, which disproportionately affected African American and Latino men during his time as mayor of New York.
On Tuesday, an audio clip surfaced on social media in which Bloomberg said 95 percent of your murders - murderers and murder victims - fit one M.O. ... They are male minorities, 16 to 25. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops."
In 2018, Bloomberg spent millions backing House candidates who supported stricter gun laws in 24 states, according to the New York Times. Of the 21 Democrats who won their elections, 12 were running in tossup or GOP districts.
"The members of Congress who won were really very out front on [gun violence prevention], and that's the reason why we have a major set of initiatives on gun control coming out of this Congress," Blumenthal said. "And [Bloomberg] helped those candidates. He recognizes the need to organize politically, not just talk about it. He's not only talked the talk, he's put money into it. I admire him for choosing it as a priority."
On Wednesday, one of those candidates - Georgia congresswoman and gun control advocate Lucy McBath, whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed in 2012 - endorsed Bloomberg.
Murphy, who likewise hasn't endorsed a presidential candidate, said he's been "really proud to partner with [Bloomberg] and his organizations when it comes to fighting for anti-gun violence measures. But you know, what I'm excited about is that there's really no difference between the candidates on the Democratic side when it comes to the issue of guns. They all are strong supporters of the kind of measures that I and the broad majority of Americans across the country support."
Po Murray, chairwoman of Newtown Action Alliance, a grassroots organization formed in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings, called Bloomberg "a long-standing supporter of gun violence prevention" who has "obviously invested significant amounts of his personal dollars into gun violence prevention. ... It has helped to change the national dialogue, particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy."
Murray added that the Newtown Action Alliance will support whoever emerges from the Democratic field to run against Trump.
"It's quite simple: Any other candidate on the Democratic ticket will be much stronger to fulfill our mission of ending gun violence in America than Donald Trump," she said.
When asked if Newtown Action Alliance has a friendly relationship with Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety, Murray pointed to what sets them apart.
"The difference is that we are an all-volunteer organization," she said. "We decided to maintain our volunteer status because we did not want to be influenced by money in fulfilling our mission. So because of that, I believe we have been able to pursue a stronger, bolder, progressive agenda."

Who is Alliance Defending Freedom? Religious-conservative legal group has targeted trans athletes in state

Texto completo: The first sign that the families of three Connecticut high school track runners are serious about preventing transgender athletes from competing in girls sports in the state is the involvement of a group called Alliance Defending Freedom.
ADF, a longtime fixture in religious-conservative legal advocacy, has built an impressive record in front of the U.S. Supreme Court while pushing causes such as abortion restrictions and limits on LGBTQ rights.
Now, ADF claims in a federal lawsuit that local high school runners Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, both transgender and both state champions, have an unfair advantage over cisgender girls. The group seeks to overturn a Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference policy that defines gender as gender identity and not the biological sex of the person.
Here is what to know about an organization The New York Times has called "the largest legal force of the religious right":
It has fought gay rights, abortion access, separation
of church and state
ADF (previously called the Alliance Defense Fund) was founded in January 1994 by Christian leaders as a legal counterweight to the ACLU, which had advocated for causes like gay rights and abortion and against school prayer.
"People of faith were being outgunned in court," founder Alan Sears told the New York Times in 2014.
In the past 25 years, ADF has taken up numerous religious-conservative causes, from preserving the pledge of allegiance in schools, to preventing same-sex marriage to limiting abortion.
In 2018, ADF successfully argued in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of Masterpiece Cakeshop, a Colorado store that refused to provide a wedding cake to a gay couple. Last year, the group took on a Pennsylvania school district that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding with their sexual identity. The Supreme Court declined to take that case, allowing the policy to stand.
Over time, the group has seemed to broaden its focus. Asked the connection between transgender athletes and religious freedom, ADF vice president of U.S. advocacy Jeremy Tedesco said the suit relates to "fundamental fairness in women's athletics."
The group has made news in Connecticut before
In 2014, ADF helped a Killingly couple sued Access Health CT because Connecticut's health exchange did not offer any policies excluding abortion coverage, arguing that "everyone in the Connecticut exchange is paying a separate surcharge for abortion coverage."
As a result of the suit, Connecticut officials agreed to offer plans that exclude payments for selective abortions.
The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies it as a hate group
In 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center designated ADF as an anti-LGBT hate group, citing the following:
* ADF's support for criminalization of same-sex marriage.
* Its attorneys' defense of state-sanctioned sterilization of transgender people in Europe.
* Its officials' suggestion that homosexuality is linked with pedophilia.
* The group's claim that gay rights will "destroy our society."
One SPLC executive has said an ADF lawyer's support of an Indian law banning gay sex was "what really pushed [them] over the top" in designating the organization a hate group.
In his email, Tedesco called the SPLC "thoroughly discredited and deeply partisan."
"SPLC bases each of these false and misleading claims on mischaracterizations of our work and cherry-picked quotes from a nearly two-decade old book," Tedesco said. "Alliance Defending Freedom has never supported the passage of laws criminalizing homosexuality. Alliance Defending Freedom categorically condemns the forced sterilization of any person. It is wrong and inhumane."
ADF is large and well-funded
ADF isn't some mom-and-pop firm. As of 2017, it reportedly had 58 staff attorneys across several locations, plus more than 3,000 other "allied attorneys." It has received briefs of support from numerous powerful lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and pushed bills at statehouses across the country. Its training programs have spread the group's worldview to thousands of lawyers. CEO and general counsel Michael Farris counts Vice President Mike Pence as a personal friend.
In 2017, The Nation called ADF a "Christian-right" powerhouse" and "a training ground for future legislators, judges, prosecutors, attorneys general, and other government lawyers-including, notably, in the Trump administration."
According to a 990 form filed in 2018, ADF received more than $55 million in contributions over the previous year and held more than $35 million in total assets.
An extremely successful history
When ADF gets involved in a case, it doesn't usually lose.
The organization claims an 80 percent success rate and at least some role in 54 victories in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2018, the Washington Post reported that ADF had brought nine cases to the Supreme Court in seven years and won every one. Tedesco cited those results as evidence that ADF's "arguments are valid, worthy, and mainstream under the law."
The group's success has attracted attention from the Post, the Times, BuzzFeed News and other national outlets.
"In any conversation regarding the future of religious liberty in the United States, one would be remiss not to include ADF," John Brown University professor Daniel Bennett wrote for the online news journal Religion & Politics. "If its supporters get their way, ADF will be shaping American culture for decades to come."

2K years of secrets hide in Thames Mudlarks scour river for artifacts from eras past

Texto completo: LONDON - On a finger numbingly cold morning, Lara Maiklem swung open a metal gate tucked behind a pub in southeast London and scrambled down a set of slick stone steps onto the banks of the River Thames.
The river runs through the city west to east, bisecting London as it winds past the new skyscrapers and old docks that line its banks.
But twice a day, the low tide pulls the flowing edges of the Thames back - dropping the river level by 20 feet in some areas - revealing centuries of forgotten London life in the fragments that poke out from the newly exposed land, known as the foreshore.
This is when the mudlarks, like Maiklem, come out.
"What you are looking for are straight lines and perfect circles," she said, her eyes scanning the surface of the mud for man-made artifacts. "They sort of stand out from the natural shapes."
Within minutes she had spotted fragments of a 17th-century jug, the half-face of a bearded man visible in the clay.
The name - mudlark - was first given to the Victorian-era poor who scrounged for items in the river to sell, pulling copper scraps, rope and other valuables from the shore. But more recently the label has stuck to London's hobbyists, history buffs and treasure hunters who scour the river edge searching for objects from the city's past.
Mudlarking's popularity has grown steadily in recent years, driven in part by social media communities in which enthusiasts share their finds and tour groups that offer a trudge through the shards of history's castoffs.
Dr. Fiona Haughey, a London archaeologist who has worked on the Thames since the 1990s, said that although some mudlarks are looking for valuables, others are looking for a connection with the everyday objects of a bygone Britain.
But it's the connection with the layers of lives of Londoners before them, revealed by the tides of the river at the heart of the metropolis, that unites the enthusiasts.
For Haughey, a specialist in prehistory, it's about what an object can tell her about its owner rather than what value it has.
"I love the conundrum of it," she said.
The Port of London Authority, which owns the Thames waterway along with the Crown Estate (i.e. Queen Elizabeth II), began to regulate exploration along the shore in 2016, requiring anyone searching the banks to have a foreshore permit.
These permits - about 1,500 were issued this year - allow people to explore the terrain, and scrape or dig into the mud up to a depth of around 3 inches. Mudlarks are advised to report objects that could be of archaeological interest to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, run by the British Museum.
Stuart Wyatt, the regional finds liaison officer based at the Museum of London who assesses the artifacts, said there was a "huge increase in numbers" of mudlarks in recent years.
"I now have months where I see only new finders," he said by email.
Britain legally obligates anyone who unearths "treasure" - defined as single finds of gold and silver over 300 years old, and hoards of coins and prehistoric metalwork - to inform the government.
Britain takes this law seriously, as one amateur treasure hunter learned in November. He was given a decadelong jail sentence after failing, along with another man, to report the discovery of a Viking hoard they dug up in western England.
A specialized permit allows deeper digging to a depth of nearly 4 feet. But those permits are available only to members of the exclusive Society of Thames Mudlarks - an invitation-only group of around 50 members - who have already held a standard permit and reported their findings to the Museum of London for two years.
Some mudlarks bring metal detectors. But most simply recover what the river has naturally revealed, usually a fascinating trinket rather than treasure.
"I like just to collect what the river decides it's going to leave on that day," Maiklem said. "It's that element of luck."
But sometimes there are more significant finds, like the first "spintria" found in Britain. Spintriae are Roman bronze tokens, with depictions of sexual acts on one face and a Roman numeral on the other, whose purpose remains uncertain.
And every tide reveals some of the city's varied story: Roman coins, medieval badges worn by religious pilgrims, an elaborate 17th-century watch.
The Thames, the very reason people began settling in the city over 2,000 years ago, is one of the best preservers of London's history. The river has been used many ways over the millenniums - as a highway, a source of food and, most important to mudlarks, as a dump.
"The Thames is unpredictable, so its just all mixed up, like a big washing machine," said Jason Sandy, an architect who mudlarks in his spare time.
In the center of London, where the heart of the Roman city stood, many of the finds are Roman or medieval. Farther west, evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found.
Where Maiklem was exploring, in Rotherhithe, once an old shipping center in eastern London, finds from the 16th and 17th centuries are the norm.
This particular morning, the sun was just rising and the tide was still on its way out as she clambered over rocks.
Her eyes flicked quickly over the mud, scattered with bits of modern trash, and settled on the barely visible edge of a coin nestled against a wooden post. She plucked it out and wiped away the grime, revealing a George III farthing, the silhouetted face of the monarch and the date, 1777, nearly rubbed smooth.
The coin had been bent into an "S" shape and had a small hole poked through its edge where a chain could be attached, hallmarks that it was likely a love token. At her feet, pieces of clay tobacco pipes from the 16th and 17th century clinked as they washed against rocks, so common as to escape a mudlark's interest.
But a perfectly round musket ball was worth plucking from the muck. The leather sole of a hand-stitched shoe, preserved by the anaerobic mud, flapped in the breeze, and she tugged at its toes to wrest it from the bank.
Huge wooden beams from the ships broken up here in the 17th and 18th centuries jut out of the mud. The Mayflower is believed to have been broken down here for scrap.
"There are so many ghosts locked in the foreshore," Maiklem said. "Also, it's so fleeting because if it's not collected from the surface, it's going to be washed away or broken down."

Texto completo: Mila Docheva faced down the camera, her contours camouflaged by an outsize hoodie raucously inscribed with neon graffiti. Her turnout, which she posted on Instagram, was an homage to her idol, pop star Billie Eilish.
"When I dress like Billie, I feel just a little bit closer to her," Mila, 14, said through a translator, in an email (she lives in Silistra, a town in northeastern Bulgaria). "I'm not a girlie girl. I am curvy, and I ride a skateboard. Feeling comfortable in my skin is important to me. Billie's style gives me the courage to do that."
Swarms of girls and young women ranging in age from under 10 to their early 20s are echoing those sentiments. They are smitten with Eilish, who took home an armful of Grammys recently, remodeling themselves in her image, posting gaudy makeovers on Instagram and other social platforms, from places as far-flung as Tbilisi and Nashville.
Eilish's following has swelled since her first single, "Ocean Eyes," went viral on SoundCloud five years ago. Her style clout has grown alongside it, on infectious display on Instagram, where she has millions of followers. It recalls the kind of fashion fervor rarely seen since Madonna's early videos incited throngs of very young fans to shimmy their frames into merry widows and pile on stacks of bangles and cataracts of chains.
The enthusiasm of Eilish's devotees denotes a striking turnabout, a new generation's rejection of the flirty babe aesthetic embodied by contemporary idols like Ariana Grande in favor of something more crazily improvised and less strenuously sexual.
At 18, Eilish, who often goes without makeup, favors a pastiche of outsize 1980s and '90s hip-hop and skater looks. That look speaks assertively to a Gen Z crowd chary of artifice and aggressive displays of sensuality.
"Her look is not about vanity," said Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster and brand strategist. "She is flipping the idea of beauty to something surreal, something influenced by gaming and the cyberculture."
"These are not the filtered images of millennials," Greene said.
Since arriving on the pop scene, Eilish has underplayed, and even willfully sabotaged, the vampiness that has long been deemed a prerequisite to stardom. To some she is the anti-Ariana, a tomboyish naïf.
Her look, paradoxically standoffish and in your face, is punctuated by shocks of blue or green hair, riotously patterned tops and tracksuits, and thorny punk and goth references. It is, in Mila's phrase, "an act of rebellion," as provocative as it is protective.
"She has an armor that's bright and loud," said Rachel Gilman, a fashion stylist whose clients have included Bloomingdale's and Adidas. "It's dye your roots green and wear the baggiest clothes in the room. It's good for girls to see that they can succeed without wearing a push-up bra if that isn't their vibe."
The star's advent, some say, could not have been more timely. "It feels fair to describe Eilish's aesthetic as both an antidote to and a queering of the hyper-feminized pop-star archetype," Amanda Petrusich wrote in The New Yorker last summer. Her style resonates, Petrusich said, "in a cultural moment when we are all trying very hard to sort out real people from the ones who are merely savvy and ambitious enough to know the right way to curate and present an authentic-seeming vibe."
Eilish's apparent realness has inevitably snared the attention of marketers as well. Her appearance last spring in the "I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins" ad campaign contrasted sharply with previous Calvin Klein campaigns modeled by scantily clad boys and girls.
Only last month H&M sought to cash in on the impact of her socially conscious, street-inflected message, releasing a line of sustainably produced sweatshirts, supersize hoodies, bucket hats and beanies.
Eilish presents as audacious and spontaneous, if a bit candied at times. "She dresses like a Disney princess, but she doesn't sound like one," said Giana, a 10-year-old social media personality from Dallas with a shock of emerald-tone hair and an Instagram following of her own. To Giana, who goes by her first name only and dresses in Eilish-inspired clashing plaids and colors, Eilish is the mistress of brash self-invention.
"She knows you can make a look fearless," Giana said, "and she makes me feel it too."
It may jolt her to learn that Eilish once scorned wannabes, venting that resentment in her lyrics. "Copycat trying to cop my manner/ Watch your back when you can't watch mine," she taunts in "Copycat," released in 2017.
She has certainly vaunted her originality. "I could easily just be like, you know what, you're going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won't have anything to do with them," she said in a profile in The New York Times last year.
"But I'm not that kind of person and I'm not that kind of artist," she said.
She seems happy enough, all the same, to exploit an ever-widening fascination with her fashion bravura, entering into partnerships with Freak City, an online platform based in Los Angeles, and with youth-oriented stores like Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic. She has introduced a children's line on Blohsh, the Billie Eilish online store that sells vinyl albums and CDs, along with fleece blankets, socks and sweatshirts with spray-painted logos.
Some fans may chafe to discover that she has worked since she was 14 with Samantha Burkhart, a high-powered stylist whose clients include Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera and Mark Ronson. Her outfits are excessive, Burkhart said.
"She enjoys the uncomfortableness of not fitting in," she said. "That appeals to a generation that grew up sick of manufactured pop music produced in a way that follows algorithms."
Admirers perceive a more earnest intention underpinning Eilish's over-the-top appeal. "She makes ethical choices in her everyday life, from wearing ethically produced fashion to leading a vegan lifestyle," Mila said. "Many people don't take outspoken young girls such as Billie and Greta Thunberg seriously. They diminish them as being just children. But I'm grateful to have them as role models."

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I. Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Closed channels of communication
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials are lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. While the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
Healthy systems of organization ensure that bad news can always flow from the bottom to the top. Systems that don't do this become increasingly disconnected from reality and unstable.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
The problem may be worse
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get. Well, as Frankie Huang notes, we can't always trust what the Chinese are saying. But to the extent that we can see what they're doing, it looks like they're pretty scared.
As I write this, they have many millions under quarantine. This drastic step, taken at considerable expense to China's already sluggish economy, suggests something serious. At the same time though, China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Surprising things ultra-successful people don't do

Texto completo: There's been plenty written about the habits of highly successful people. They set goals and they follow through. They learn and listen. We get it.
But what do the most successful people avoid? From celebrity entrepreneurs to captains of industry, here are seven surprising things that top achievers prefer to skip:
1. Don't have a Plan B. We're taught to have a backup, but that safety net can actually do more harm than good. No Plan B means you have to be all-in and, in turn, your intensity will drive better performance.
2. Don't fight the last war. There's a saying that too often, "Generals fight the last war." With today's unprecedented rate of change, we need to use a fresh approach instead of blindly relying on what worked in the past.
3. Don't accept the world as it is. Those that change the world first have a bold vision of what's possible. Refusing to accept things as they are is hallmark of history makers.
4. Don't compare to others. Top achievers benchmark performance against their own potential, not what others do. They lead instead of follow.
5. Don't play it safe. Not being afraid to be a little crazy, the most successful people know that progress only exists outside our comfort zones.
6. Don't wallow. Uber-successful people mess up just like all of us. But they don't focus on the failures or let negative thoughts inhibit their growth. They take their lumps, learn what they can, and quickly move on to the next challenge.
7. Don't get comfortable. A telltale sign of a top performer is that they're never satisfied. Yes, they celebrate the wins, but they are always on the hunt for more. It is an unquenchable thirst for achievement that unlocks potential.
It turns out, your stop-doing list is just as important as the to-dos. Embrace these don'ts, and you'll be well on your way to unlocking greatness.

Texto completo: Who are the best 11 players?
That was the question Red Holzman asked his staff every day in Knicks training camp before the 1979-80 season. After practice, the legendary coach would make his own list and ask assistants Butch Beard and Hal Fischer to make theirs. In the final week of training camp, they all had listed the same guys.
The Knicks were not looking to make history, only to assemble the best possible basketball team. Yet  on the final day of camp, when they decided to go with their best players, Beard, who is African-American, thought he should state the obvious to Holzman, who was white.
"I said, 'Red, do you realize we've chosen nothing but black players?' " Beard recalled in a recent phone interview. "Red looked at me and said, 'We are choosing the best team in talent, not in color. I don't care if they are all green.' And that's how we ended up with that ballclub."
Forty years ago, that ballclub made history by becoming the first NBA team without a white player on its roster.
The fact that this was a big deal seems unfathomable to many young fans of today's game, which may go a long way toward explaining why it has become a relatively unknown piece of NBA history. Still, judging from interviews with members of that team and published articles from that season, it was a very big deal. Not everyone was as color-blind as Holzman.
First, some quick history. The first African-American players joined the NBA in the 1950-51 season, a year after the merger of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America. The three African-American players who broke the color barrier were Earl Lloyd of the Washington Capitols, Chuck Cooper of the Celtics and Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton of the Knicks.
While more African-Americans slowly gained roster spots in the 1950s and early 1960s, it wasn't until the advent of the American Basketball Association in 1967 that doors really opened. The ABA, which later merged with the NBA, ushered in an above-the-rim style of play and signed a number of extremely talented African-American players, including Artis Gilmore, George Gervin and Julius Erving.
According to a Sports Illustrated story in February 1979, 75% of players in the league were African-American. Still, players talked of unstated racial quotas, especially in Phoenix, which had more white players than black players in 1979.
"These are things you kind of understood if you were a player," said Earl Monroe, who had come into the league in the late 1960s, played on the Knicks' 1973 championship team and was the elder statesman on that 1979-80 Knicks team. "You just took it for granted, because that's how it was."
Entering the 1979-80 season, the Knicks were far from their glory years earlier in the decade. The team was coming off a tumultuous 34-win campaign during which Holzman came out of retirement to replace Willis Reed, who was fired as coach after 14 games. In February 1979, the Knicks traded Bob McAdoo to Boston for a haul of draft picks.
The Knicks had two white players on their team in 1978-79. Rookie John Rudd barely played and second-year forward Glen Gondrezick averaged 5.0 points and 5.7 rebounds. The Knicks entered training camp looking to find spots for three first-round draft picks: Bill Cartwright, Larry Demic and Sly Williams. They also were quite impressed with Hollis Copeland, a free- agent small forward who had played at Rutgers.
"From my understanding, I was the last player on the list. I was the one who made it an all-African-American team," said Copeland, who now works in New York as an institutional stockbroker. "I remember Butch Beard coming to me and saying, 'Cope, you made it pretty hard for them.' At the time, I didn't know what he meant."
Gondrezick was the last man cut on Oct. 10, 1979, two days before the start of the season. Copeland said he later heard that general manager Eddie Donovan and Madison Square Garden chairman Sonny Werblin had to sign off on Holzman's decision.
"When it came down to our last cuts, Red and I felt we had to keep the best players. If we had kept Gondo and Rudd just because they were white, we would have lost the respect of our other players," Donovan told New York Times columnist Dave Anderson in 1979. "The players know who can play and who can't. I've had a couple of calls from fans about our decision, but when I asked them if they would have wanted us to keep Gondo or Rudd as tokens, they said of course not."
In the fourth game of the season, on Oct. 18, 1979, the Knicks again made history  in a 129-115 loss to the Pistons in Detroit. For the first time ever in an NBA game, every player who participated was African-American. The Pistons' only white player, rookie Steve Malovic, did not leave the bench.
Soon after, a headline for a New York Post column by Peter Vecsey said: "The all-black Knickerbockers." The columnist wrote that "judging from my mail, a number of fans have no desire to watch black performers." The column went on to say that several unnamed "bigots" used a racially and morally disparaging remark (the Post printed it, but we won't) to refer to the team.
The column, understandably, upset the players.
"Nobody wants to be called that," Copeland said. "I thought it was in poor taste. But we just kind of let it go. We didn't want to make a big stink."
Cartwright, who had grown up in northern California competing with players of many different ethnicities, said it was weird to find that the racial makeup of a team mattered to anyone.
"You would think New York, which is a mecca for folks to enter from different countries around the world, wouldn't have any problems," Cartwright said in a phone interview. "It's like anything else. 'I don't have any racial issues until you want to marry my daughter.' It is what it is. The league has come miles since any of that has gone on."
Monroe, who had come up in an era in which players were routinely harassed, talked to some of the younger players about his experiences and how they needed to deal with attitudes like this.
"I kind of took that as my role as a player who had been through all that," Monroe said in a phone interview. "It wasn't so much New York attitudes, but fans around the league let you know how they felt about you as an opponent and as a black man as well. From the '60s, I saw things go through different changes. You just had to know how to deal with it."
Team members said much of the racism they felt was indirect and from the media, not from the New York the fans.
 "If you get the lead and didn't keep the lead, it was implied that our players weren't smart enough to keep the lead," Beard said. "That's how things were said."
Added point guard Jim Cleamons: "Occasionally, there were some snide comments made, but we were all professionals. What was important to us was to try to win basketball games. We weren't trying to make social commentary."
The Knicks improved by eight games that year, to 39-43, but finished fourth in their division. There was some to-do made about the fact that attendance was down that season by 37,119. Yet it can be argued that much of that had to do with the fact that the team was coming off a 31-win season. In 1980-81, the Knicks regained those fans and more as what still was an all-African-American team went 50-32.
Today, with the increasing number of international players, all-African-American rosters are a less common occurrence. And few seem to notice those rosters. Even in 1994, no one wrote columns about the racial makeup of the all-African-American Knicks team that went to the NBA Finals.
That the racial composition of a team  once was considered controversial now seems like something out of an alternate reality.
Said Copeland: "To tell you the truth, I didn't know until now that we were the first team in the NBA. I thought it was just New York. It's funny. 'Cause I don't think most of us thought what we were doing was history-making.
"We just were happy to be out there and living our dream." "Red, do you realize we've chosen nothing but black players?"

Texto completo: If you saw the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, you couldn't miss the South Korean guy with the oversize glasses and flyaway hair who kept walking up to the stage to accept Oscars for "Parasite," a dark spoof of capitalism. All told, he received four: best international feature, best screenplay, best director and - in a history-making first for a foreign-language film - best picture.
His name is Bong Joon Ho, and while many Americans are probably unfamiliar with him, he's been making movies for more than 20 years. He's one of the leading lights of South Korea's film industry - known as Chungmu-ro, a term you might be hearing more frequently in the future - and is held in high esteem by his Western colleagues. Quentin Tarantino, in particular, has been a supporter, putting some of Bong's movies on his year-end best-of lists. In turn, Bong (that's the director's family name) honored one of his own heroes at the Oscars when he said, "The most personal is the most creative," then attributed the quote to "our great Martin Scorsese." Cameras caught Scorsese in the audience, looking a little verklempt.
If "Parasite" is your first introduction to Bong's movies, you might want to do some catching up. Here are four earlier efforts from a filmmaker who, in a single night, turned the Academy Awards into a truly global affair.
MEMORIES OF MURDER (2003) In this police procedural based on true events, two detectives (one played by Song Kang Ho, of "Parasite") hunt for the first known serial killer in South Korean history. Though a smash in its native country, the film was limited mostly to the festival circuit here. Tarantino raved about it, though, and most Western critics who saw it gave it strong reviews.
THE HOST (2006) The members of a dysfunctional family battle a fishlike, man-eating creature from the Han River. Bong's update of classic monster-movies - a dash of anti-American sentiment and some not-so-gentle ribbing of South Koreans, too - held its premiere at Cannes and became a critical smash. Fun fact: the fishy creature was modeled on Steve Buscemi in "Fargo."
SNOWPIERCER (2013) Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer and others play post-apocalypse survivors on a train perpetually circumnavigating a frozen Earth. "Snowpiercer" was universally acclaimed for its inventive sets, star-studded cast and relevant themes. It was almost Bong's big American hit - but its box-office momentum was delayed by studio chief Harvey Weinstein, who unsuccessfully pressured Bong to make 20 minutes of cuts and then consigned the film to a limited release.
OKJA (2017) Bong turned to Netflix to make this oddball comedy-adventure about animal rights and environmental problems. The cast included Jake Gyllenhaal, Tilda Swinton (in a dual role) and Paul Dano, but the real star was the CGI title character - a genetically modified super-pig raised by a young farm girl (Ahn Seo Hyun). The New York Times recently named "Okja" one of the most influential films of the past decade, calling it "a miracle of imagination and technique."

Andrew Yang’s important warning

Texto completo: Bill Clinton’s campaign theme song was Fleetwood Mac’s Don’t Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow); Andrew Yang’s might have been “Start thinking about the day after tomorrow.”
Yang, an Asian American entrepreneur and political neophyte, ended what he had called “the nerdiest presidential campaign in history” after last week’s New Hampshire primary, saying that as a “math guy,” it was clear to him from the numbers that he was not going to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Indeed, he won only 2.8% of the vote.
Nevertheless, he got a lot further than a number of experienced politicians, including members of Congress and governors, in a surprising campaign that, in the words of The New York Times, “developed a fiercely loyal following of disaffected voters across the political spectrum.” He raised $30 million and rose from less than 1% in the polls to between 4% and 5% by early 2020.
Yang’s signature issue was a call for a universal basic income, or “Freedom Dividend,” under which the federal government would send every American adult a monthly check for $1,000, without regard to income or employment. Medicare and Medicaid would not be affected, but those receiving government benefits such as food stamps could choose to keep receiving them or take the $12,000 a year instead. The scheme would be paid for partly by imposing a 10% value-added tax on goods and services at every stage of production.
The idea is not new, and experts continue to debate its efficacy, but the value in Yang’s rebranding of it lies more in his analysis of why it’s needed than in the remedy itself. He warned that the country is going through a profound economic transformation — a “fourth industrial revolution” — in which automation threatens to create mass unemployment, chaos and perhaps even violence, against which the Freedom Dividend would provide a buffer.
Automation does not only threaten factory workers and truck drivers, Yang wrote in an op-ed for the Times last November. Bookkeepers, retail and food service workers, office clerks, call center employees, even teachers, accountants, journalists, doctors and lawyers face the risk of being replaced by machines, he argued.
Again, some experts say the threat of automation is overblown, or that it cannot be predicted. But it seems to us that Yang is on to something here that needs to be considered as a big-picture risk along with climate change. In fact, he makes a link between the two: 78% of Americans live in a state of financial insecurity, he told the Times editorial board, and “if you can’t pay next month’s rent, it’s very hard to worry about climate change.” And it’s not impossible to imagine that the chaos produced by each could merge to produce social unrest on a massive scale across the globe.
Certainly it’s hard in the day-to-day heat of a presidential campaign for candidates to give extensive thought to the forces that are transforming the American economy and how they might be channeled to promote the public interest, or at least to mitigate harm. Yang provided a stimulating dose of that kind of thinking. The next Democratic president might want to take advantage of his fresh perspective by appointing Yang to a new Cabinet office: Secretary of the Future.

Texto completo: Most Americans have faith in the fairness of the electoral system, though they recognize that it's flawed.

No mobs took to the streets in 2000 when a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court all but handed the presidential election to George W. Bush, the loser of the popular vote. There was grumbling but no civil unrest in 2016, when the vestigial Electoral College made Donald Trump president though his opponent beat him at the polls by nearly 3 million votes.
That faith, however, is being tested by foreign meddling in American elections. Tested by history, which accords every state, big or small, two senators, giving out-sized clout to states with small populations. Tested by the Electoral College system, which makes some votes worth three or so times more than others and worth nothing in winner-take-all states.
Gerrymandering, drawing districts to give one party a significant advantage over another, puts a thumb on the scales while the Supreme Court looks the other way. It's made politics grossly partisan. In many districts the greatest threat to an incumbent comes not in the general election but from a primary challenger whose views are further to the right or left.
The electoral scales have also been tipped by time. Vermont, in 1860, had more people than Florida. As of the 2010 census, Vermont has a population of 625,741 and three electoral votes, or one for every 209,000 people; Florida has 18.8 million residents or one electoral vote for every half-million people.
New Hampshire, with 1.35 million people and four electoral votes, benefits from the Electoral College and the Constitution's two senators per state provision. But the apportionment of political power has become deeply undemocratic. The beneficiary has been the Republican Party, whose members dominate the Senate despite regularly winning a minority of the popular vote.
Recently, journalist Ezra Klein, founder of the news and analysis website Vox, published Why We're Polarized, one of many books exploring the great American political and cultural divide. An excerpt of the book published in The New York Times included a startling statistic: By 2040, 70% of Americans will live in the 15 largest, mostly coastal states. Those states are predominantly blue or purple. That 70% will, thanks to the skewed system, be represented by only 30 senators. Meanwhile, the other 30% of America in mostly red states will be represented by 70 senators.
“It is not difficult to envision an America where Republicans consistently win the presidency despite rarely winning the popular vote, where they typically control both the House and the Senate despite rarely winning more votes than the Democrats. . . . Down that road lies true political crisis,” Klein wrote. He's right.
More than a few speakers during President Trump's impeachment hearings referred to the Senate, no doubt to curry favor, as “the world's greatest deliberative body.” Perhaps, at times in the past, it was. But what deliberation there was has been almost completely supplanted by nakedly partisan plays for party power.
The U.S. Senate, as evidenced by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's successful attempt to deny a president a Supreme Court appointment, is a failed institution.
Many prescriptions for change to make presidential elections and Senate representation fairer and more democratic have been proffered. It's time for all of them to get serious consideration.
None will be easily accomplished, but we agree with those who believe that the unfairness that is the status quo presents a danger to democracy.
How do New Hampshire's senators, current and past, assess the situation? We look forward to sharing their views.

At Back Bay Grill, the food, the service and 4.5 stars align Four decades in, the dining room could use an update, but the excellent food makes up for any decorative shortcomings.

Texto completo: I didn't realize it at the time, but I tweeted at my future self this weekend.
As I finished a late breakfast at a restaurant where I've become a regular customer (and as much as I wish I could tell you its name, I cannot. The staff know me and my favorite dishes, but not what I do for a living), I took a few final sips of coffee and let myself daydream about the business's future. With a jolt, I sat upright, imagining an unhappy future timeline where the ovens power down and the restaurant closes its doors forever. The thought alone made me feel queasy.
So I tweeted something sentimental yet heartfelt about the cruel inconstancy of the food world, ending with a pledge of unilateral commitment. "I need this place," I confessed.
This morning, as I sipped another cup of coffee and paged through my photos of a recent meal at Portland's Back Bay Grill, I caught glimpses of possible future versions of myself. There they sat - diners (mostly men) of a certain age fresh from their taxis (Uber and Lyft are a digital bridge too far), their smartphone flashes flickering over their menus like lighters held aloft at a rock concert - scanning the night's dinner options even though, as one chuckled to his familiar server, "I like to look, but you and I already both know what I'm going to order, don't we?"
Across four two-tops, I witnessed the same scene play out over and over. And, finishing the last of my coffee today, it hit me: They're just like me: They need this place.
"People do come here on a routine basis, and continuity is important to us," said Larry Matthews, Back Bay Grill's owner and executive chef. "I sometimes say it takes two or three times coming here to really understand the place. That's when we can start to remember the cocktail you like and where you want to sit. The chance to take care of people maybe over several years is what we all enjoy here. I think that's why it turns into a favorite place for a lot of people."
If you've never eaten at Back Bay Grill, you should know: It's an old-school, white-tablecloth restaurant that looks very much like it did when former owner Steve Quatrucci (now the proprietor of Monte's Fine Foods) opened the doors for the first time in 1987. The beige walls, wire-suspended track lighting and desaturated mural recall the restaurant's late '80s/early-'90s youth. Every meal is a trip through a time machine that navigates cosmic wormholes with a GPS tuned to the frequencies of "A Different World" and The Bangles.
Yet, as dated as the dining room is - its scuffed and gnawed-looking banquettes and Golden Girls-style scones are gasping for a refresh - Back Bay Grill turns other aspects of the retro feel into an asset, largely through service. I have eaten in no other Maine restaurant where staffers unfailingly preface every question with "May I..." and go to great pains to avoid deploying sloppy, faux-solicitous service tropes like, "How are the first bites tasting?" and "Are we still working on that?" Instead, they do things the old-fashioned way: They pay attention.
The kitchen is much the same, both in its deliberate, understated approach to plating, as well as in the mainly French-and-Italian influences that - while perhaps not trendy in 2020 - pilot the menu along a well-traveled flight path to success. Why fix what is so magnificently not broken?
Indeed, some dishes, like the lavender-marinated duck breast ($36) have been on the menu since Matthews began cooking at Back Bay Grill in 1997. Served with pan-seared, French-style chive-and-lemon gnocchi, the breast is crisp-skinned, infused with the aroma of red wine and thyme (yet little lavender), and extraordinarily juicy. Five years ago, in a five-star review, this paper's critic named the duck as one of his favorite dishes at Back Bay Grill. In terms of the sheer quality of the breast, I agree enthusiastically.
Yet propped alongside the breast is a seared, square-cut block of juniper-and-peppercorn-spiced duck leg confit. It's every bit as good as the breast, yet with no garnish of its own and no clear relationship to the gnocchi or underlying sautÃ©ed chard, it seems like a stowaway on the plate. If the intention is, as Matthews later confirmed to me, to present duck "two ways," the confit deserves full co-star status and a counterbalancing accompaniment of its own.
It should tell you all you need to know that this, along with a gritty, underheated Swiss meringue on that evening's mousse-like chocolate marquise - a long slice of dense, bittersweet cake plated like a cruise ship sailing through an archipelago of crushed pistachio and crÃ¨me anglaise dots ($10) - were the only miscues of my recent visit.
The rest of the meal was a stunner, from wobbly Casco Bay scallops, seared hard and lowered into a tidal pool of cubed, saffron-tinted potatoes, glistening brown beech mushrooms and translucent crÃ¨me-fraiche-and-leek broth ($37), to a tangle of arugula greens dribbling pomegranate vinaigrette dressing onto wedges of yielding, Riesling-poached pears and savory Vermont chevre mousse ($12).
"For that combination, you'll want something light, but not too bright," my server suggested. "Maybe a glass of the Central Coast pinot noir we have by the glass?" It was a wise selection, and at $10 a glass, a reasonably priced one for a restaurant whose entrees can drift north of $40.
Unexpectedly affordable wine is one of Back Bay Grill's secret charms. Sure, the broad, appealingly eclectic list includes special-occasion Chateauneuf-de-Papes and Barolos, the sort of splurge-worthy bottles you'd expect from a white tablecloth restaurant. But side-by-side with them sit dozens of sub-$40 options, including several under the almost unheard-of $30 mark. Nostalgic wine pricing might be the most appealing of Back Bay Grill's many callbacks to the past.
Which is not to say that Matthews and his team don't keep up with what's happening in the culinary world. They do, although they introduce new ingredients and techniques gently, in almost homeopathic quantities. Take the crunchy Maine crab cake, topped with pickled shallots and draped with two sweet pea tendrils. To achieve a shattering crunch, Matthews breads the cake in Japanese-style panko breadcrumbs, an ingredient that began to find an audience in the U.S. just over a decade ago. Then he pushes further - almost imperceptibly - via an aioli he fortifies with lime juice and chili.
I like to imagine that first dinner service 10 years ago, when he introduced the dish to the menu, the restaurant's regulars casting suspicious, uncertain glances at the menu, then finding themselves unable to complain. But if they had, Matthews would have been prepared.
"We have so many regular guests here, I can use the guests' reactions to figure out if something is working or not. I think it's because we have such a loyal clientele, we get a true read on stuff. They trust us enough to try something and understand that we really do want feedback from them. And they tell us."
I understand why. Those regulars are after a good meal, no doubt. But they're also deeply invested in Back Bay Grill's continued success. Their candor is an expression of something meaningful: They need this place. We all do.

FALSE PROGRESS EMPOWERMENT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SELF-OBJECTIFICATION

Texto completo: DEAR SISTERS,
A woman has to be the one to say this, and it's time: We females cannot have it every which way at once. Too many of us are trying to. It is hypocritical, it defies logic and it won't create progress.
Every day brings news of women speaking out courageously against assault, against gender bias and bullying, against body shaming and objectifying, while calling for equal treatment, for professionalism, for "body positivity" and acceptance.
These messages, however, are often muddled. Some of them - as currently practiced - are mutually exclusive.
Had I written this 10 days ago, instead of beginning "Dear Sisters," I would have addressed myself directly to Jennifer Lopez's vagina. I'm sure she wouldn't mind because she certainly put it out there at the Super Bowl. On the Jumbotron.
Empowerment via a stripper pole is just one of the mixed messages I'm puzzling over. You too?
I first noticed the term "body shaming" in a viral post in 2016, from two young women angry about objections to their strutting around in butt-baring bikinis in front of little children at a public beach. "We won't be body-shamed!" the girls said.
But the objecting parents were not, in fact, trying to make the girls feel ashamed of their healthy bodies; they were raising questions about when and where revealing those bodies might be inappropriate and disrespectful of others.
Multiply this conflict by a few million. It surfaced some months before the major media made a big, mocking deal, in early 2017, about Vice President Mike Pence's refusal to dine alone with any woman other than his wife.
A Los Angeles Times columnist wrote, "If professional women and men cannot be alone together, women are the ones who will pay the price." Experts declared it "gender discrimination."
The next year brought Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court - and the advent of #BelieveWomen. I'd be fascinated to find out if Mr. Pence's practice is now spreading. Frankly, it should.
If we women must be able to meet alone with male colleagues and must also be believed on any assertion we make about what was said and done at those meetings, well, it's not women who will "pay the price" - it is men. They'd be crazy to take that risk.
If it's unlikely a career-ending accusation might ensue, it is already certain that men - and plenty of women - object to such a gross double-standard.
I know, I know - overcorrection is normal. Women have been putting up with unequal treatment since, oh, the beginning of recorded history. But some of today's pushback is actually cynical manipulation.
Which brings us back to J.Lo's crotch.
In the first few days after the Super Bowl show, opinions veered between "empowering" and "disgusting." A Chicago Tribune writer opined that two female performers' decision to entertain millions with "sexy aplomb" should not prevent us from "tak[ing] women, as a gender, seriously."
OK, if that performance does not lead to a negative view of all women neither can it claim to create a positive one for all women. But it did. It claimed to be all about female power - through text, neon symbols, a girls' choir and, apparently, crotch close-ups.
Let's face it: the "empowerment" talk was just window-dressing for major moneymaking. Both Shakira and J.Lo's streaming and downloads skyrocketed after the show. They monetized their hoo-has.
If equality is what we're after, it should be sobering to realize that very few men monetize their genitalia. Those who do are part of a highly specialized, um, industry. They don't appear on "The Tonight Show" post-performance to weep and talk about empowerment.
If we objectify ourselves, we can't complain in the next breath about men objectifying us. We can't demand equal treatment and then insist we are not subject to the same rule of law as men.
If we continue to insist on having it every which way at once, we will have re-earned the old stereotype of women being illogical. This isn't progress.

Texto completo: Amid a tweetstorm Saturday morning, President Donald Trump shared a passage from a weeks-old news article likening him to a vengeful king.
Mr. Trump tweeted a section of a Feb. 1 New York Times story about his Senate impeachment acquittal in which reporter Peter Baker wrote, "Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate Impeachment Trial of President Trump. 'When you strike at the King,' Emerson famously said, 'you must kill him.' Mr. Trump's foes struck at him but did not take him down."
The president's tweet was part of an assortment of unrelated commentary and videos he shared before he headed to his private golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla.
He credited Fox News' Laura Ingraham with a gripe over the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who Mr. Trump views as a political enemy.
He retweeted a video of an alleged antifa member threatening physical harm to San Francisco Republican John Dennis, who is running against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
And the president shared a 5-year-old video of the Republican mayor of Georgetown, Texas, accidentally leaving his microphone on when he left a public meeting to use the bathroom.
DENVER MAYOR SAYS PIT BULL BAn stays
The mayor of Denver, voicing concern about the risk of injury to children, said he would veto a measure passed by City Council that would have repealed the city's ban on pit bulls.
Mayor Michael Hancock said he had received passionate comments from thousands of residents on both sides of the issue but could not "in good conscience" sign the repeal, which passed the City Council on Monday.
Pit bulls were banned in the city and county of Denver in August 1989 after several fatal attacks.
THIRD STUDENT-RUNNER STRUCK BY TRUCK DIES
A third member of a suburban Oklahoma City high school cross-country team who was struck by a speeding pickup truck has died.
Kolby Crum, 18, died Saturday at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center.
Ms. Crum was among seven members of the Moore High School cross country team who were struck on Feb. 3, authorities said. According to police, the driver, Max Leroy Townsend, 57, was going 79 mph in a 25 mph zone when he crossed two lanes of traffic onto the sidewalk and struck the students.

Texto completo: Valentine's Day, possibly, was not all that you had hoped. Add to that recent events in Washington and Iowa. Mix in Mookie Betts. What you need, probably, is Jeweled Chocolate Cake, topped with a mascarpone frosting and pralines.
Thanks to the memoir form's refusal to die, help is on the way. The recipe for Jeweled Chocolate Cake appears in “ Save Me the Plums ," Ruth Reichl's latest book, which chronicles her years as editor in chief of Gourmet magazine.
A former New York Times restaurant critic, Reichl remains among the most appealing food writers in the business. She fell for Gourmet at age 8, the minute she ran across an old copy (the kid was a foodie before there was a name for it). Nevertheless, years later, when the bigwigs at Conde Nast came courting, she felt ill-suited to the slick world of magazine journalism. Persistent wooing, along with the prospect of pulling the once vibrant publication out of its torpor, overcame her resistance.
“Save Me the Plums" is her account of how, for a few glorious years, this erstwhile bohemian embraced the kind of New York glamour her mother had always fantasized about. Like much literary nonfiction, the book reads novelistically, glibly re-creating scenes and dialogue in ways the reader must take as approximations of the truth. Reichl proves an irresistible narrator, dishing just enough gossip to hold readers but avoid being sued.
Always — and this is probably her secret sauce — she returns to the food. Yet she also understands that the best food writing is a form of armchair travel. Her chapter on a magazine-subsidized trip to Paris memorably includes lacquered duck skin with shiitake, as well as a wistful encounter with a black lace dress.
In “ Of Morsels and Marvels ," Caribbean author Maryse Conde offers readers the experience of actually living in Paris, and visiting a great many places besides. Her food enthusiasms accompany her to Ghana, India, Japan, and Australia. As a child in Guadeloupe, Conde took an early interest in cooking, and experimenting with local ingredients. She shrugged off her mother's disapproval (the family was among the island's elite; cooking was for the uneducated classes). Eventually, through food, Conde became a student of “ethno-cuisine" — and apparently the acquaintance you most hoped would invite you over for dinner.
Now in her 80s, Conde is a highly regarded novelist who was selected for the New Academy Prize, bestowed when scandal prompted cancellation of the Nobel for literature in 2018. Despite having taught at several American universities, she may be better known on the world stage than among American readers. (Conde writes in French; “Morsels" has been translated into English by her husband, Richard Philcox.)
As a writer, Conde has espoused borrowing freely from literature and history, just as she champions experimenting with new combinations in the kitchen. “Cookbooks," she says, “are for dummies."
Henrietta Lovell might add: so are teabags. Even in her native Britain, she notes, people have been settling for bad tea for years. Through her own business, called Rare Tea, Lovell is on a mission to change that. “ Infused: Adventures in Tea " is the follow-your-bliss story of how she got started, and her globe-trotting quest for the finest leaves.
Lovell's memoir is packed with fascinating history, along with precise descriptions of tea varieties and how best to prepare them. Water temperature counts (she condemns boiling), as do the timing and number of infusions.
The reader follows Lovell to tea-growing regions in India, China, South Africa, and beyond. In her drive to get loose-leaf tea into the finest restaurants, she wooed top chefs with imaginative pairings. (Green tea is best with smoked salmon.) She also landed some big-name clients. Working closely with Momofuku, she devised a cold-brew technique now used to make the restaurant's iced tea.
The self-styled Tea Lady is no teetotaler. In Tokyo, a night of drinking at Hooters nearly caused her to miss an important meeting with Noma, which was planning a pop-up restaurant there. Lovell survived, and ultimately conquered even Paris. She writes proudly of winning over a roomful of French chefs with a tea-and-caviar tasting.
The importance of Paris to all these food writers sent me back to A.J. Liebling. His “ Between Meals: An Appetite for Paris ," published in 1962, describes his discovery of the city's gustatory pleasures during a year intended for study.
Watching Liebling assemble phrases is something like watching Jacques Pepin chop onions: both make practiced technique look effortless. The sexism in Liebling's book may surprise and put off some readers. Yet he adores food and writes about it with the kind of tender rapture Ruth Reichl would understand. He also throws her rise in a male-dominated world into high relief. Perhaps there is hope for the future after all; if not, then surely the consolations of a well-made cassoulet.

Notes from a post-'Parasite' movie world

Texto completo: Wait, did that just actually happen? Did “Parasite," the best picture of 2019, really win the Oscar for best picture of 2019? You'll excuse me and hundreds of other pro and semi-pro prognosticators for thinking that voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might have admired Bong Joon Ho's wickedly twisty social satire — might even have loved it — but would stop well short of handing a foreign-language film the evening's big prize.
Some people got it right — the ones who sensed momentum shifting in the final days of Oscar season. I still say that if the ballots had been due a week earlier, “1917" would have taken best picture. But maybe I'm wrong about that, too. Maybe the ground rules really are changing. With that in mind, let's examine some of the conventional wisdom being spun out in the wake of what New York Times critic A.O. Scott has dubbed “the Bongslide."
Recent efforts to diversify the Academy are paying off . Yes and no. It's true that since the #OscarSoWhite debacle of 2016, the increased push to induct new and more diverse members has resulted in double the number of film professionals of color who can vote for an Academy Award — from 8 percent of the total AMPAS body four years ago to 16 percent in 2019. That's progress, but that's also still a lot of old white guys. And the fact that half the 842 new members in 2019 were women didn't keep Greta Gerwig from being shut out of the best director category.
And yet — note that six of the past 10 best picture winners have come from directors of color or from other nations: “The Artist," “12 Years a Slave," “Birdman," “Moonlight," “The Shape of Water," and “Parasite." And only one best director of the past decade — Damien Chazelle of “La La Land" — was born in this country. In fact, three Mexican filmmakers, Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro Iñárritu, and Alfonso Cuarón, pretty much own the directing category. Suddenly it's last year's “Green Book" that's looking like the outlier.
It's time to retire the Oscar for “international film" — or at least cancel it when a foreign film wins best picture. Nonsense. While it's great that “Parasite" has broken a 91-year tradition of best picture winners speaking English (or, as in the case of “The Artist," not speaking at all), it's highly unlikely that the trick will be repeated any time soon. The “international" category remains controversial, in that one and only one movie from any given country is allowed to be submitted — which benefits smaller countries while punishing worthy films. Without it, though, the awards would seem awfully parochial. And to the people complaining about “double-dipping" because “Parasite" won both best international picture and best picture, well, guess what. It was.
Bong Joon Ho is ready for his reward: a big-budget Hollywood movie. That's how it used to go, anyway: Director from another land scores big, cashes in his chips with a US studio deal. But Bong, who has puckishly referred to the Oscars as a “local" competition, doesn't have to prove himself to anyone at this point — not with “Parasite" grossing $165 million worldwide. If anything, it's US audiences who will be exploring the director's backlist: not just well-known recent titles like “Okja" (2017) and “Snowpiercer" (2013), but the psycho-mama drama “Mother" (2009), the monster-movie goof “The Host" (2006), and the terrific but hard-to-find “Memories of Murder" (2003), currently streaming for free on popcornflix.com.
The “Parasite" win is why mass audiences don't watch the Oscars anymore. Nah. It was widely reported that this year's Academy Awards reached the smallest audience in the broadcast's history. So what? It's still the most-watched of the major awards shows, by far. The show's diminishing ratings point instead to larger, more complex forces: the fact that movies no longer lead the pop-culture discussion (TV shows do) as they did for decades; the widening split between corporate fantasy-franchise filmmaking and the kind of movies we deem worthy of awards; the ever-proliferating choices of things to watch and platforms on which to watch them. The days of “Titanic" uniting an entire country behind it are gone forever.
US audiences are finally ready to handle movies with subtitles . True, I think. It's long been a cliche that many Americans don't like “furrin films" because they don't like reading subtitles (or can't read them fast enough). What has moved the needle, I think, has been the ready availability of closed captioning on TV shows from other lands, many of which can be found on Netflix or other, more dedicated streaming platforms. It's not just foreign languages, either — hands up, anyone who has turned on the subtitles when the British accents get too bloody 'ard to parse. And once you've gained the habit, a whole world of new content opens up.
“Parasite" won because it's an exotic trip to a foreign culture. Nope. “Parasite" won because its outrageously funny/scary dramatization of the corruptive split between haves and have-nots makes as much sense to American audiences in the early 21st century as to the folks back home in South Korea, where the movie was a smash hit and a lightning rod for debate. Who are the real parasites, the clan of poor con artists or the privileged rich family? Once the dust has settled and your senses have stopped tingling, you're invited to think about such questions, and about a system that enables the situation in the first place. One only wonders if Oscar voters watching the movie realized Bong's pitiless calculus applies to them as well.
A win for “Parasite" means a loss for “1917." “1917" will be just fine. While it certainly must have taken the wind out of Sam Mendes's sails to go from the consensus leader heading into the night to his film's winning three Oscars for cinematography, visual effects, and sound mixing, it was overall the kind of evening that felt inclusive and fun rather than competitive. The decision to go host-less for a second year turned out to be a smart decision: The evening moved along with brisk fellow feeling and even wrapped up on schedule, which has to be a first. The fact that every best picture nominee except “The Irishman" won something told the world not that the Academy was handing out participation trophies but that the breadth and depth of filmmaking in 2019 is something to be celebrated (even if voters didn't know what to do this year about women filmmakers or actors of color). In this context, “Parasite" was a reminder that a movie can be fiendishly entertaining while making you think and feel things you never have before. That's pretty much a definition of the form right there.

TOP INTERNATIONAL STORY CORONAVIRUS: U.S. will evacuate Americans from ship: Metro Atlantans are expected to be among evacuees today in Japan.

Texto completo: Metro Atlanta residents are expected to be among the hundreds of Americans evacuated from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan today, health officials said.
Passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess have been quarantined in Yokohama for more than a week after an outbreak of coronavirus infections on the ship.
Officials quarantined the roughly 3,700 people after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. Since then, more than 200 new cases have been reported on the ship.
About 400 people aboard the vessel are American, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday.
"To fulfill our responsibilities to U.S. citizens, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese health care system, the U.S. government recommends that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring," the CDC said.
Those returning on the state-chartered flights will be subject to an additional 14-day quarantine at two U.S. air bases: Travis Air Force Base in California and Joint Base San Antonio-Lack-land in Texas.
Not all of the Americans stranded overseas will be allowed to return home, however.
Passengers showing symptoms of the virus must remain in Japan for medical care, health officials said. At least 40 infected Americans have already been taken off the ship for treatment, according to The New York Times.
Among them are Atlanta residents Renee and Clyde Smith, who will likely remain at a Tokyo hospital as they recover, their son said Saturday.
Macon attorney David Smith said his 80-year-old parents remain in good spirits despite being confined to their hospital room.
"I've been talking to them every night. They're doing very well," Smith said. "They say the people at the hospital are treating them like royalty."
Clyde Smith was diagnosed with pneumonia when he first arrived at the hospital. He is doing better now, and neither he nor Renee is showing any more symptoms, their son said.
Their grandsons, who are both in their 20s, have not caught the virus and are expected to board one of today's flights back to the U.S.
David Smith said they are excited about getting out of their small room on the cruise ship but understand they will remain quarantined for at least two more weeks.
Nearly 200 Georgia residents already are being "isolated" in their homes after returning from recent trips to China.
Georgia authorities are avoiding using the word quarantine, saying instead that people are being isolated in their homes for 14 days, the illness's incubation period.
The broader coronavirus outbreak started in December in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people in central China. Since then, the number of diagnoses has exploded.

DEVELOPMENTS
|The U.S. government's
announcement seemed to trigger a chain reaction among other countries. Minutes after the U.S. Embassy's letter was sent, the Australian Embassy in Tokyo sent its own email to its citizens aboard the Diamond Princess, citing the U.S. evacuation plans and assuring Australians that it was "examining options." |Within China, a flurry of new announcements reinforced the government's continuing efforts to recalibrate its balance of economic and public health concerns.
|In another possible hurdle to economic revival, a top Chinese banking official said Saturday commercial banks must disinfect and stash any cash they collect before releasing it back to customers.
|Though the World Health Organization has praised China's response to the crisis, American officials in recent days have privately expressed doubts about whether China is underreporting cases, as well as about the official timeline for the first infections.

Texto completo: Just before New Year's, I posted a photo of a giant roast pig on Instagram.
I paused before I did it, and at first I wasn't exactly sure why. I had the brief thought that by Western standards, the photo might be deemed a little graphic: The head of the pig was still attached, its cheeks sliced open. But that wasn't really the source of my reluctance -- we all know pork chops once had heads.
I was hesitating, I realized, simply because a giant roast pig is so ostentatious -- so flagrantly, flauntingly meaty. And I felt uneasy because I was posting such a spectacle of meat at a time when many were making resolutions to not eat any meat at all.
I've recently watched so many people around me become vegetarians, or sometimes vegans. They are doing so for reasons -- both moral and environmental -- I understand and support. But I've been awed by the seeming casualness with which they make these decisions. I admire them and at the same time know that this choice is one I will almost certainly never make.
I felt this tension when I ate the pig. My mom had bought it -- an expensive indulgence -- for the end-of-chemo party she was throwing herself at the midway point of being treated for breast cancer. In southern Chinese culture -- a sphere of which my Chinese Malaysian family is a part -- whole roast pigs are brought out for special occasions: weddings, funerals, festivals. My mom can recall hauling one, not yet roasted, into the jungle each year on Tomb Sweeping Day to visit her grandfather's grave. He's buried in the jungle because he died there after his family fled their home during World War II.
I felt the same tension a week later when, after I'd returned home to London, I went with a newly vegan friend to the farmers market. She bought mushrooms and I, feeling slightly sheepish, bought chicken breasts that I wanted to use to make Malaysian chicken rice, which I did later that night, sending a picture of the results to my mom back in Kuala Lumpur, where she asked about the quality of the chili sauce.
And I've felt it in the weeks since, which I've spent on an unabashed -- or rather, slightly abashed -- Malaysian food kick, newly insistent on procuring wax duck and wax sausage for Lunar New Year even as I've stopped picking the options with meat in them at lunchtime fast-casual restaurants.
This most recent visit was the third time I'd been to Malaysia within a 12-month period, an astonishingly frequent rate of return for someone who at times has gone years without going back. The first time was a simple trip to see family, before my mom's diagnosis. The second was to help out after her first round of surgery -- to cook, which she didn't need any help with, and to help pick an oncologist, which she did. This latest trip was to attend the end-of-chemo party.
Confronting my mother's mortality has had me contemplating my Malaysian-ness/Chinese-ness, as well as trying to hold on to them a little more tightly. But this, it turns out, is tricky -- because I am, realistically, not that Malaysian. I'm half Caucasian; whatever baby Cantonese I once spoke is long gone. I love my family, but I've spent essentially my entire life in the West. When I go to Malaysia, it is familiar, but still foreign.
My connection to the food, though, feels completely authentic. Part of this stems from food's special power as the most accessible of cultural touchstones. But part of it is that this is what I ate as a child, what I genuinely grew up with, because of who my mom is, even if she, and these dishes, originated somewhere thousands of miles away.
These are foods I feel fluent in, even if, when I try to order from the fried banana woman, I have to hold up my fingers to indicate how many I want, because I forget how to say any number larger than three in Malay. These foods are precious to me, in the way that a Thanksgiving turkey is not because, roam where I may, I could not stop being American even if I tried. But to stay a little bit Malaysian, I realize, as I contemplate a future that eventually will take place without my mom, will require an active effort of will, to ensure that what tethers me to that country doesn't stretch until it snaps.
What I am saying is that casual conversions to veganism are white privilege.
Just kidding! I am not saying that.
I am also not saying that any of the above is a problem, exactly. The solution is to not be dogmatic, to be adults. We are all capable of understanding the difference between meaningful and meaningless meat.
What I am saying is simply that I don't think I'm alone in feeling this tension. Such feelings transcend race and ethnicity, but I happen to be part of a generation of Asian-Americans whose parents came over (and then, in some cases, went back) after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. There is a whole cohort of people at this moment who are around my age, with parents who are getting older, who are having children of their own and contemplating what sort of relationship they'll be able to offer these children to the distant countries their families are from, even as they contemplate what sort of future they can offer their children at all. Amid all this, food remains an important link in a connection that can sometimes feel tenuous. When I asked a friend about her New Year's resolutions, she said one of them was to cook only Vietnamese food for the month of January.
In "The Omnivore's Dilemma," published in 2006, before the connection between diet and climate change had become so mainstream, Michael Pollan wrote about his reluctance to become fully vegetarian. To do so, he wrote, would mean losing something along the way that "I'm not prepared to dismiss as trivial"; that what seems like such a simple decision, to stop eating meat, has a way of alienating us from our histories and our traditions and the people around us. It is an unideal irony that the pull of these forces has become stronger for me even as combating climate change becomes ever more urgent.
The throughline to all of this, of course, is modernity. Modernity made our families this way, scattering them around the globe, leaving some of us feeling insecure in our roots. Modernity is why I must fly more than 6,500 miles to see my mom, leaving almost a ton of carbon dioxide behind each time I do. Modernity is why she can get first-class cancer treatment in Malaysia, at a specialist hospital where they brag about their radiotherapy machine. Modernity is why we can buy the roast pig; it is why we feel that we have to eat it, even if perhaps we should not, because not eating it would fundamentally change who we are.

Texto completo: A year ago we committed to work toward a goal of parity for women on the letters page. How are we doing?
A year ago, prodded by a reader who wrote eloquently about how women were underrepresented on the letters page of The Times, we started the Women's Project, aiming to correct that imbalance and better reflect the diversity in society. We committed ourselves to work toward a goal of gender parity and to report on our progress in February 2020.
We haven't reached the goal line yet.
For the last year, we have tracked and entered into a spreadsheet the gender of every writer we've published on the daily letters page. As of today, the tally is 43 percent women, 57 percent men -- numbers that have remained remarkably constant for several months. While we do not have exact data from previous years, we do know that there are now far more women on the page than in the past.
We have also done spot tallies of the much larger number of submissions. There the percentage (when a writer's gender can be determined) is about 25 to 30 percent women, about the same as a year ago, before the project started.
There were consistent patterns: Politics, the economy and foreign affairs? The majority of submissions come from men. (Women represented just over a third of the published letters about politics.) Parenting, health, education and relationships? A larger percentage from women. (For more details about published letters, see below.**)
Interestingly, entries to our high school letter-writing contest last year were disproportionately from girls and young women, as reflected in our published responses. And when we asked readers to name the book that most influenced their lives, a significant majority of both submitted and published letters were from women.
Some of the results surprised us: Homages to stick-shift cars? We published letters from five women, and none from men. And we published a plea from 33 writers, all of them women, to stop using the term "quid pro quo" in the impeachment inquiry, in favor of the more explicit "bribery" or "extortion."
Over all, though, we're not satisfied yet. While there was a small uptick in letters from women right after we announced the project, we still sometimes find ourselves struggling to ensure that women's voices are heard on a wide variety of topics.
At the project's one-year mark, we're reaffirming our commitment to working to reach gender parity. But what was reinforced by this project is that our letters pages are richer for this new collection of voices -- and it compels us to broaden our efforts further, to ensure that we are publishing a range of letters from an even more diverse pool of writers going forward.
Still, we can't do it without your help. After all, we can select letters only from among those you submit. So, as we wrote a year ago, "we want to urge women -- and anyone else who feels underrepresented -- to write in (here is a guide)."
Our email address is letters@nytimes.com. And our door is always open.
THOMAS FEYER, Letters Editor
** These are some of the topics in which published letters since the start of the Women's Project were predominantly from women: helicopter parenting; girls outpacing boys at school but not at work; when parents don't vaccinate their children; college experiences; women without children; women traveling the world alone; widows and finances; end-of-life care; the American family and working mothers; the trauma from school shootings; President Trump's appeal in rural America; how moms and dads divide the work; older women, not just about looks; abortion; women and the diet industry; separated at the border, at 4 months old; empty nest no more; home health aides; assisted living; menopause; miscarriage; abnormal sleep cycles; the story of two homeless children in New York; robots that provide health care; the cost of college textbooks; a soaring rate of suicides by the young; balancing being a surgeon and a mother; the lost art of listening; middle-class families in despair; a turning point in President Trump's impeachment trial; the Senate's vote to block impeachment witnesses; Nancy Pelosi and the State of the Union address; J. Lo at the Super Bowl, and body image.

Texto completo: While seeking to reconcile science and religion, Father Coyne also vigorously supported Darwin and challenged believers in intelligent design.
The Rev. George V. Coyne, a Jesuit astrophysicist who as the longtime director of the Vatican Observatory defended Galileo and Darwin against doctrinaire Roman Catholics, and also challenged atheists by insisting that science and religion could coexist, died on Tuesday in Syracuse, N.Y. He was 87.
His death, at a hospital, from complications of bladder cancer, was announced by the Jesuit-run Le Moyne College in Syracuse, where he had been a professor of religious philosophy after retiring from the observatory in 2006.
Recognized among astronomers for his research into the birth of stars and his studies of the lunar surface (an asteroid is named after him), Father Coyne was also well known for seeking to reconcile science and religion. He applauded Pope Francis for addressing the role that humans play in climate change, and he challenged alternative theories to evolution like creationism and intelligent design.
"One thing the Bible is not," he told The New York Times Magazine in 1994, "is a scientific textbook. Scripture is made up of myth, of poetry, of history. But it is simply not teaching science."
Brother Guy Consolmagno, the current director of the Vatican Observatory, said in an email that Father Coyne "was notable for publicly engaging with a number of prominent and aggressive opponents of the church who wished to use science as a tool against religion."
Among those he engaged on the debate stage and in print were Richard Dawkins, the English evolutionary biologist and atheist, and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna, who, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 2005, defended the concept that evolution could not have occurred without divine intervention.
During Father Coyne's tenure, the Vatican publicly acknowledged that Galileo and Darwin might have been correct. Brother Consolmagno said it would be fair to say that Father Coyne had played a role in shifting the Vatican's position.
While the church formally acknowledged in 1992 that it had "erred in condemning Galileo" in 1633 for promoting the theory that Earth revolved around the sun, Father Coyne was among the critics who complained that the admission was not only too late but also too little.
In 1996, Pope John Paul II, without defining evolution, said that it was "more than just a hypothesis." His statement that Darwin's views had "progressively taken root in the minds of researchers, following a series of discoveries made in diverse spheres of knowledge," suggested that at least in public schools, religious faith and the teaching of evolution could coexist.
In an article in the English Catholic weekly The Tablet in 2005, Father Coyne sought to reconcile religion with evolution.
"God in his infinite freedom," he wrote, "continuously creates a world that reflects that freedom at all levels of the evolutionary process to greater and greater complexity. He is not continually intervening, but rather allows, participates, loves."
He went further by finding fault with intelligent design.
"If they respect the results of modern science, and indeed the best of modern biblical research," he wrote, "religious believers must move away from the notion of a dictator God or a designer God, a Newtonian God who made the universe as a watch that ticks along regularly."
He added, "Perhaps God should be seen more as a parent or as one who speaks encouraging and sustaining words."
George Vincent Coyne was born on Jan. 19, 1933, in Baltimore, the third of nine children of Frank and Elizabeth (Brune) Coyne. His father was a traveling clothing salesman, his mother a homemaker. He is survived by two brothers, Thomas and Francis.
After being tutored by a nun on weekends ("no Saturday afternoon baseball or basketball for me," he recalled), he won a scholarship to Loyola High School in Towson, Md.
He joined the Society of Jesus when he was 18 and attended a Jesuit novitiate in Wernersville, Pa., northwest of Philadelphia, where his Greek and Latin literature professor imparted a passion for math and astronomy.
Father Coyne earned a bachelor's degree in math and a licentiate in philosophy from Fordham University in 1958 and then a doctorate in astronomy from Georgetown University. He completed a licentiate in sacred theology at Woodstock College in Maryland and was ordained a priest in 1965.
He joined the Vatican Observatory as an astronomer in 1969, taught at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and directed its Catalina Observatory. He was appointed director of the Vatican Observatory by Pope John Paul I in 1978 and was its longest-serving director, holding the post for nearly three decades.
Father Coyne presided in 1993 when the observatory mounted a new Advanced Technology Telescope on Mount Graham in southern Arizona. (Light pollution at the observatory's historic headquarters in Castel Gandolfo outside Rome had prevented the telescope from being installed there.) He established a research group at the University of Arizona and organized a summer program for graduate students.
In the 1990s, Father Coyne arranged conferences at the Vatican Observatory in collaboration with the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, a program of the Graduate Theological Union, in Berkeley, Calif.
"Father Coyne oversaw the modernization of the observatory's role in the world of science," Brother Consolmagno said. "He essentially re-founded the Specola Vaticana," using the Italian name for the observatory, which dates to at least the 18th century.
After retiring in 2006, Father Coyne was president of the Vatican Observatory Foundation until 2011, when he was appointed to the McDevitt chair of religious philosophy at Le Moyne. He held that position at his death.
"George was one of the pre-eminent figures in the Catholic world who could speak intelligently and articulately about both science and faith," said the Rev. James Martin, editor at large of America, the Jesuit magazine. "And George, by nature a humble man, could often dazzle."
In the Times Magazine interview, Father Coyne was asked, "How can you describe the universe as a vast empty infinitude, largely uninhabited, and still believe in -- "
"The centrality of man in the universe?" he interjected, completing the reporter's thought.
"There's no doubt about it," he went on. "To our own knowledge of ourselves, we are unique in creation because of our self-reflexivity. I can know myself knowing. I am having a conversation with you, and I can remember that conversation. To this, the Catholic Church comes along and says, 'The reason this is true is because you have an individual soul."'

Nancy (With the Lying Face)
I have a perfect storm of mental and physical defects. I cannot keep my emotions off my face. I have nerve damage in my left leg, hip and mid-lower back from spinal cord decompression surgeries. Opiates don't work.
I have had back problems since 2002. I know how to handle pain. I can work through it, but my face betrays me. Folks at work see me grimacing and feel horrible for me. When I attempt (and fail) to suppress the grimace, they feel even worse, thinking they sense how brave and honorably pitiable I am, and how much it must really hurt, since I cannot cover it up.
My job includes speaking. People do not believe that I mean what I say because my face "tells them" I am unable to produce concentrated thought due to my suffering. I am not only not taken literally, I am sometimes not even taken seriously. When I get mad because someone does not believe me, they say the pain is making me unpleasant and grumpy. In fact, it is their own disregard of my vocal utterances that upsets me.
I work at a medical clinic. I have to communicate in person. But my friends say, "I know you want to attend the monthly meeting, but no one wants you there because you make everyone feel so bad because of your pain. And they don't really listen to you either, since they can't stop thinking about how much you must be suffering. So just go home!"
Is this an old male's version of the large-breasted woman not being taken seriously?
-- Jake
A large-breasted woman may not be typecast as a brave, sympathetic figure, but she is likely to have some experience with back pain, on top of other injustices. Although her slighting is rooted in sexism, not good intentions, I wager she feels a comparable resentment.
Your account made me think of the dolphin's smile -- that cetaceous skeletal quirk that the former "Flipper" trainer Ric O'Barry, now an anti-captivity activist, deems "nature's greatest deception" because it creates the illusion of perpetual happiness. The mirror image of your trouble.
I can only imagine how frustrating your job is. I also understand that strangers imagining insight into your existence is the problem. In pursuit of practical advice, I shared your letter with my father, a retired bus driver and librarian with a passion for small talk, as well as severe mobility and pain issues. (When he walks, it's typically with two canes. His progress is labored, but he's great at spotting dropped change.)
He suggests a two-pronged confrontation. First, go even further than telling people you are managing your discomfort: Promise to alert them if your pain is such that you can't work, or need aid. Otherwise, they are to assume you're set. Repeat this to anyone whose solicitousness affects you negatively. And keep your end of the bargain.
Second, you might have to make people feel a little bad to get them to stop feeling bad. Here's what my dad said: "You don't want to be not included in stuff. People look at me walking and, I can tell, have sympathy for me. But, for me, it's better to get up and get out and do whatever it is I want to do. Psychologically, that makes me feel better."
Remind your co-workers they cannot make your life smaller because they think it would make them more comfortable.
Besides being shockingly rude, it's illegal for a workplace to request that someone not attend meetings because of a disability. If you want to deliver a gut punch on top of whatever formal actions you may or may not take, tell co-workers you feel disappointed when they exclude you. People can't stand being responsible for disappointment.
When passers-by ask if my dad needs help, he cracks that he would love a brand-new back, if they have one. While his coronation as a King of Comedy may never materialize, this demonstrates that his brain is not entirely preoccupied with his physical maneuvering. Lots of people just want to be absolved from their perceived obligation to help, and a joke lets everyone off the hook.
If all else fails, turn the tables on your co-workers. Say their reactions are distracting you -- would they like a moment to collect themselves?
Would You Die for Your Work Friends?
I work for a small start-up that's seen its share of turmoil. Most could be attributed to our chief executive, and it's largely manifested in the form of turnover. People do not want to work for a man they consider to be overly demanding and meanspirited. (I myself have designs on leaving.) A lot of people who I enjoyed working with and consider friends no longer work with me. I put a picture of three of them -- one who was fired, two who left -- on my cubicle wall.
My supervisor said "some people" have expressed concern about the picture because it gives the impression that I'm resistant to the "positive strides" the company's culture has made in the past few months. He asked if I wouldn't mind taking it down. Given that he has only been with the company two and a half months, I have to conclude that the "people" he referred to is the C.E.O.
I agreed to take it down because I like my supervisor. But the notion that I should be expected to take down a completely appropriate, inoffensive picture of my friends because the C.E.O. doesn't like it feels like an abuse of power. Is this a valid concern to raise with H.R.? This is hardly the worst thing I've experienced in my career, but I feel like I have an obligation to stand up for myself.

"If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything," they say. But how about this: If you take a stand for everything, you'll constantly be having to stand up -- annoying. Also annoying: Weaponizing décor to make a silent hostile point, and getting upset when the point is taken. Cool ex-colleagues are not a protected class. No one's humanity has been impinged. Perhaps the picture rankled your C.E.O., but anyone could have found it odd. Direct your energy toward your goal of leaving. (Alternatively: Advance through the ranks to unseat the boss, and commission a big, beautiful mural of miscellaneous departed colleagues.) It's hard to know whom to root for here -- maybe the people unaware a former co-worker hung their photo in his or her cubicle.

Texto completo: A couple visiting Waikiki Beach tested positive for the virus after returning to Japan. Public health officials are investigating to see if anyone else was exposed.
HONOLULU -- Chantelle Pajarillo had settled into a resort on Hawaii's famous Waikiki Beach, hoping for a peaceful long weekend away from work and school with her family. The peaceful part came to an end as soon as she turned on the television set Friday night and learned that a Japanese couple who had been staying at the same hotel had fallen ill with the coronavirus.
Ms. Pajarillo, who lives 25 miles away on another part of the island of Oahu, did not know what room the couple had stayed in, but it did not matter: She requested a stash of disinfecting wipes and started cleaning every surface she could find.
"I wiped down everything I knew they would touch: the sliding door, the refrigerator, countertops and the bathroom," Ms. Pajarillo said on Saturday as she walked back to the pool at the Grand Waikikian, toting a stack of towels. "I'm a germaphobe myself and I have three little kids so I want to make sure I take every precaution."
Hawaii health officials were working swiftly over the weekend to find anyone who might have had contact with the Japanese couple, who had also visited the island of Maui. Health authorities said the couple, both in their 60s, was not diagnosed until they returned to Japan, but the husband began showing symptoms while still staying in one of Hawaii's most popular tourist neighborhoods.
More than nine million people visit Hawaii each year, one in three of whom are international tourists. Health officials said that there was little chance that the infection had spread, but that they would continue to search for anyone who had prolonged contact with the couple. There had been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state before the two tourists were diagnosed in Japan.
But at least one local resident said he believed that he had spent time with the Japanese man who was later confirmed with the virus. The resident, John Fujiwara, 52, said the friend that he had visited with for about half an hour on Feb. 4 had the same travel itinerary as the man described by state health officials; he also lives in the same city and is also in his 60s. Mr. Fujiwara said he had not been able to reach his friend since he left Hawaii on Feb. 7.
The man seemed healthy, if a bit tired, when they had met to drink coffee, catch up and exchange chocolates as gifts, Mr. Fujiwara said. The man had spent that morning shopping in Chinatown, and had told him that he planned to attend a Japanese language event at a local grocery store immediately after their visit.
Mr. Fujiwara said that he had reached out to state health officials, and had offered to isolate himself after reading a report about the man in The Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
In an email he shared with The New York Times, a disease intervention specialist with the Hawaii Department of Health did not confirm that Mr. Fujiwara's friend was the one who had been diagnosed, but told him that he should contact the department if he had any symptoms before Tuesday, which would be two weeks after he saw his friend -- the maximum incubation period for coronavirus.
"I plan to go to dinner with my girlfriend tonight, unless things change, specifically because I have it in writing from the State of Hawaii Department of Health to continue my daily routine," Mr. Fujiwara said.
Janice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, said that the man who was confirmed with the virus "is not believed to have had any prolonged, close contact with Hawaii residents," but that health officials were continuing to investigate.
Dr. Sarah Park, the state epidemiologist, said the man had most likely been exposed to the virus before leaving Japan or while traveling to Hawaii. He and his wife, who was also confirmed on Saturday with the virus but did not show symptoms while in Hawaii, arrived on Maui on Jan. 28. The man was also symptom-free in Maui, but after the couple moved to Honolulu, on Oahu, on Feb. 3, he began showing signs of a cold.
A spokeswoman for Hilton Grand Vacations, which runs the hotel and time-share where the couple stayed in Waikiki, said the company was working with health officials. A letter slipped under the door of vacationers' rooms provided tips on how to keep from getting the virus, washing hands being chief among them.
The man who became ill wore a mask when he was outside and while on the flight back to Japan, officials said, and was diagnosed with pneumonia, and later with coronavirus, after returning to the couple's home in Nagoya, Japan's fourth-largest city.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that it may be possible to transmit the virus before showing signs of the illness, but that a person is much more likely to spread it when they have symptoms.
Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said she agreed with Hawaiian health officials that people who had traveled with the man were at greatest risk, though anyone who touched surfaces shortly after he did -- such as a faucet or toilet handle -- could also be at risk.
"I think we're going to have a lot of cases like this popping up, where people come into a place and get diagnosed there, or leave and we find out after the fact that they're sick," Professor Gordon said.
More than 68,000 people around the world have been infected with the virus and more than 1,650 have died, almost all of them in mainland China, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan. In the United States, 15 people have been confirmed with the virus, most of whom have been said to have mild symptoms.

Buttigieg Hits 10 Fund-Raisers in 2 Weeks

Texto completo: He leads in the delegate race after Iowa and New Hampshire. But the map is dramatically expanding ahead of Super Tuesday and so are the costs of campaigning.
In the compressed and crucial weeks between the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg is moving aggressively to replenish his campaign coffers with an ambitious schedule of 10 fund-raisers held across six states in a 14-day period.
The money chase for Mr. Buttigieg began in Indianapolis on Thursday at the 16,000-square foot home of a supporter as donors noshed on egg salad and cucumber sandwiches -- "What a thrill to be back home again in Indiana," Mr. Buttigieg said -- and continued on Friday in California, as he traveled from San Francisco to Silicon Valley to the state capital of Sacramento for a photo line with contributors.
He will soon visit Seattle, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, the Washington D.C. area, Miami and Palm Beach -- with most of the events built around states that will vote in early March.
In addition to Mr. Buttigieg himself, his national policy director, Sonal Shah, a veteran of the Obama administration and Goldman Sachs, is hitting the road to headline events in Virginia, Maryland and Ohio, where donors are asked for up to $ 2,800 to become a "champion" and join in a "policy conversation" (some tickets can be had for as little as $ 54). And Mr. Buttigieg's husband, Chasten, is featured at another five events, with two stops in Wisconsin, two in Denver and one in Phoenix.
The frenetic fund-raising pace opens up Mr. Buttigieg to potential criticism from progressives that he is the preferred candidate of the wealthy. That is a line of attack that both Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont ("I don't have 40 billionaires, Pete") and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ("The mayor just recently had a fund-raiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals") have relished in recent months.
A virtually unknown small-town mayor a year ago, Mr. Buttigieg built a sizable list of small online donors and a formidable big bundler operation in 2019.
The need for money is acute as the candidates enter one of the most intense phases of the primary with consequential contests on each of the next two Saturdays, in Nevada and South Carolina. The latter state will be followed almost immediately by 15 states and territories on the next Tuesday, including the big prizes of California and Texas, where the cost of advertising can be prohibitive.
With the most delegates after the first two contests, Mr. Buttigieg, who ended two terms as mayor of South Bend, Ind., last month, now faces one rival in Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, who has almost limitless money, and another in Mr. Sanders whose army of small contributors have been giving in accelerating amounts. Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire from California, has been spending heavily, and rising in the polls, in Nevada and South Carolina.
Mr. Buttigieg had entered 2020 with $ 14.5 million in the bank. But his pace of spending since then burned through much of that sum and some of his money is earmarked for the general election and cannot be spent in the primary.
His monthly payroll had climbed to $ 2.7 million by December, federal filings showed. He spent $ 2.5 million on Facebook and Google ads since Jan. 1, company records show. And Mr. Buttigieg invested $ 6.5 million in television ads from Jan 1. through the New Hampshire primary this past Tuesday, according to Advertising Analytics, a media tracking firm. Plus, there are the other costs to run for president that are only growing -- chartered planes, renting event space, polling, consulting fees and more. His campaign reported a single $ 761,039 credit card payment in December, for instance.
In the final quarter, Mr. Buttigieg raised $ 24.7 million, though he spent far more than that during the three-month period, about $ 34 million. Other candidates, including Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, similarly spent more than they raised as the primaries neared.
His advisers have previously told donors that they were investing almost everything in Iowa, where he earned the most state delegate equivalents, and New Hampshire, where he finished a strong second, in hopes that command performances in those two states would open up political and financial opportunities beyond.
"All the chips were on the table for Iowa," said David Jacobson, a Buttigieg fund-raiser and former ambassador.
"It was money well spent," said Robert Mandell, another former ambassador and Buttigieg fund-raiser.
But the impact of Mr. Buttigieg's apparent win in Iowa was dampened by the delayed and muddled results that are still subject to a recanvass. His campaign announced he had raised $ 4 million in the four days afterward. That is a significant sum but still less than what rival strategists said might have otherwise been expected for winning the opening contest.
Mr. Sanders was raising money at a clip of well above $ 1 million per day online in early February, according to an estimate based on figures released by his campaign. And that was before he won the New Hampshire primary. Ms. Warren's campaign told supporters this week she had raised $ 5 million in the nine days following the Iowa caucuses. Neither senator is holding traditional fund-raisers for large donors.
One of Mr. Buttigieg's events will be on Feb. 23 at the home of Representative Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat and the first member of Congress to endorse him, with five other congressional co-hosts. Three days later, he will hold three fund-raisers across Florida -- which does not hold its primary until March 17 -- including one in Palm Beach whose hosts include Cynthia Friedman, a longtime Democratic contributor.
The campaign had sent invitations to even more events, including in Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., on Feb. 27 -- the $ 500 level ticket is listed as sold out online for the Atlanta gathering -- but Buttigieg aides said those events were being rescheduled.
Mr. Buttigieg is not alone on the fund-raising circuit. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. organized a conference call with his national finance committee after his fifth place New Hampshire finish to reassure skittish donors. He has upcoming fund-raisers in Colorado, Nevada and South Carolina, the latter two in states that vote later this month.
On Thursday, Mr. Biden held two events in New York that drew a notable group of Wall Street contributors. Organizers said the events raised almost $ 800,000, a large haul for a candidate who had sagged to fourth and fifth place in the first two contests. Mr. Biden also said on "The View" this week that he was raising about $ 400,000 per day in online donations.
That same evening, Michael Halle, a top strategist for Mr. Buttigieg, was in Washington meeting with donors, with contribution levels up to $ 1,000 (other Buttigieg advisers, including Lis Smith and Michael Schmuhl have previously headlined fund-raisers).
Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have been assisted by super PACs, which are legally barred from coordinating strategy with the campaigns. Mr. Halle drew some criticism for a post on Twitter two days after the Iowa caucuses all-but-directing where such support could best be used.
The Buttigieg campaign announced expanding its Super Tuesday operations on Thursday, saying it would have "boots on the ground" in each of the states as of next Monday. That is far later than Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who ramped up operations in 2019.
Not all of Mr. Buttigieg's staff in Iowa and New Hampshire are keeping their jobs. The campaign said it was following the terms of the union contract.
"When positions in Iowa ended after the caucuses, we've been offering new positions as they become available as directed by the collective bargaining agreement," said Chris Meagher, Mr. Buttigieg's spokesman. "We're glad to have already offered the vast majority of them new positions on our team."

Texto completo: It's the time for travel deals in cities like Seattle, Boston and Dublin. If you pack smartly, the rain, sleet or "wintry mix" won't stand a chance.
Now that the holidays are over, it's the time for off-season deals in cities like Seattle, Boston and Dublin. The skies may be gray and the sidewalks slushy, but you'll face fewer crowds in the museums, find tables at hot restaurants and have a better shot at getting those theater tickets everyone's talking about. And if you pack smartly -- starting with a travel umbrella, of course, and then some or all of the items shown here -- the rain, sleet or "wintry mix" won't stand a chance.
Xtratuf 6-Inch Ankle Deck Boot
These Xtratuf boots have the most slip-resistant outsole of any boot we tested, and they're also among the most comfortable for walking. ( $ 94 to $ 100 on Amazon)
Marmot PreCip Eco Pants
Rain pants may seem like overkill, but if you're going somewhere really rainy -- and you won't have access to a dryer -- they can be very useful. ( $ 80 from Marmot)
Timbuk2 Custom Prospect Laptop Backpack
The Custom Prospect is as slim and stylish as it is comfortable and durable. And its waterproof liner will keep your purchases dry while you're shopping. ( $ 134 from Timbuk2)
Helly Hansen Moss Rain Coat
Available in both men's and women's cuts, this well-constructed coat hits at mid-thigh, and looks less outdoorsy than many rain jackets Wirecutter tested. ( $ 110 from Helly Hansen)
Heat Men's and Women's Base Layers From 32 Degrees
Keeping dry is just one part of staying warm -- wearing a lightweight, form-fitting base layer under your regular clothes will help, too. ( $ 20 to $ 28 at Macy's)

Men, You Need to Listen

Texto completo: Kimberly Probolus, who a year ago urged women to raise their voices and write more letters to the editor, now discusses the importance of listening. Kimberly Probolus, whose letter about the underrepresentation of women on the letters page inspired the Women's Project, reflects a year later.
Over the summer, I attended a party where the hostess introduced me to another guest as the woman who wrote the letter to The New York Times about why not enough women write letters to the editor. The guest, a man, must have only heard some of this introduction, because he started telling me about an amazing new initiative by The Times to achieve gender parity in letters submissions. In fact, this man was so excited to tell me all the reasons women didn't write letters to the editor that he still did not hear me when I told him that I wrote the letter.
Finally, at the end of "his" story, I gave it one last shot. "I wrote the letter," I said, to which he responded with the appropriate mix of embarrassment, apologies and admiration. While this may seem like an episode out of Rebecca Solnit's essay "Men Explain Things to Me," the man I encountered was not the least bit arrogant, displaying a boyish giddiness toward feminism. And yet, he could not hear the small blond woman standing right in front of him.
Since the publication of the letter, it's been exciting to read more women's letters and to see the efforts by The New York Times to give women a more prominent voice. Like the letters editors, I hope that women will continue to write. But it's not enough to ask women to speak up: to write more letters, to raise our voices, to "lean in." The problem is not that women aren't speaking up. As far back as ancient Greece -- when Cassandra warned the Trojans about that giant wooden horse -- women have been speaking loudly and clearly. The problem is that men aren't listening.
Male readers of The New York Times, this is about you. You who call yourselves feminists and attend women's marches. You who coach your daughters' soccer teams. Yes, you are trying, but I'm struck by how spectacularly so many of you continue to fail at listening, this most basic of human skills.
Fortunately, there are practical strategies to help men become both better listeners and more active listeners. First, to be a good listener, stop talking. You cannot listen to her story and be present for her if you're too busy thinking about yourself or your next brilliant comment. Second, active listening means hearing the words women are saying and taking them at face value, even if those words contradict your prior assumptions or your own agenda. Third, being an active listener means asking questions.
Women do not speak with one voice. We don't all want the same things, which is why you need to ask women what they want and then respect their opinions, even, and most especially, if it means ceding some of your own power in any given situation. Practicing feminist listening is something you can start right now. Look up from your paper or screen and ask the woman across from you, "How can I be a better listener?" Listen to her, and do what she says.
This ask may seem small, but listening must be the first step toward systemic change. Members of Congress should listen to the opinions of their female constituents and prioritize the legislation that they ask for. Organizations should listen to their female employees about what policies would be most helpful to support their personal and professional flourishing, and then take active steps to enact those policies.
Social media should regulate online platforms to safeguard women against harassment and to ensure that their voices are heard. Our legal system must figure out how it can listen to women, particularly in cases of rape. And it needs to respond to women whose identities exist at the intersection, listening to the nuances of what it means to be injured because one is both a woman and black, a woman and queer. Listening will not solve inequality. But progress is impossible if men can't hear women.
Identifying and vilifying hateful, sexist men is easy. It's a lot harder to tell the men in our lives who support us and love us unconditionally that they, too, are part of the problem. I hope that they will listen, and I hope that they will change. If The New York Times can do it, perhaps its male readers can, too.

Texto completo: There are certainly nice benefits to staying in an Airbnb. But if an emergency happens, you might be on your own.
Choosing an Airbnb over a brand-name hotel can save you a few bucks. It can also allow you to be in the thick of a neighborhood while experiencing a more homey vacation.
But an important trade-off of staying within the booming home-sharing industry is that you usually don't have a front desk or concierge -- and in the case of an emergency, you are probably on your own.
That means extra planning might be needed to help reduce stress and let you best enjoy your time away, especially traveling overseas.
Over the past few years, my wife and I have stayed at Airbnb apartments in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and several other cities. While there are a lot of ideas online on how to stay safe, including suggestions from Airbnb, here are some tips we learned along the way about how to prepare for the worst, when calling the front desk is not an option.
Reviews, Reviews, Reviews
This one might seem quite obvious, but do your due diligence and really get to know the place where you'll be staying.
It is usually best to find Airbnbs with many positive reviews and a very high positive rating. Read those reviews closely and look for red flags. Don't just read one or two reviews -- read 20 or more. Any hint of trouble is worth taking very seriously as you make a decision.
Lock It Up in a Safe
In hotels, I had grown accustomed to a fairly standard amenity: a small safe for important documents.
Safes are not widely installed in Airbnbs. In fact, I never could find one in a listing until our recent rental in Lisbon -- a deciding factor among several strong listings. Upon arrival, I made sure our host showed us the safe and how it worked. I appreciated being able to lock away our passports, a second credit card and local currency, and not thinking about it much until it was time to depart. I even threw a towel over the safe so it wouldn't be an obvious target in a break-in.
You can buy a small portable safe, one that fits in your carry-on. I've lugged around one that attaches to a pole or a pipe, and locks with a key or code. I usually find a discrete spot to stash it after I arrive.
Learn About Doors
If you stay in enough home shares, you'll soon learn that there are all sorts of doors with different locking mechanisms. Take an extra minute when you arrive to have your host clarify how things work so that you don't lock yourself in or out, or invite in unwanted guests.
On a visit to Paris, it wasn't until a few days into our visit that we learned that we should have been locking a second security door. There was also a slightly confusing maneuver we didn't know about when leaving that could have effectively locked us in the apartment at the end of our trip.
Health First
Without the help of a hotel staff, if a health emergency arises, you'll be on your own. That makes it especially important to know how to get health care in a hurry.
A friend of mine learned that lesson when his young son closed his finger in a door at an Airbnb in Barcelona. Luckily, they made it to a hospital quickly, but it was a good reminder that it's important to be prepared for a health issue.
Along those lines, be sure there's a first aid kit -- and you know where to find it.

Texto completo: Russia is expected to drop into second place in the gold medal count for the 2014 Winter Olympics after sports officials on Saturday disqualified a biathlon winner for testing positive for a steroid, the New York Times reported.
If upheld by the International Olympic Committee and on expected appeals, the ruling would signify the final unraveling of a Russian effort to dominate medal counts by cheating with a state-sponsored doping program.
The International Biathlon Union ruled that Evgeny Ustyugov, who competed in a gold-medal-winning relay team, had used a banned steroid during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. "The consequences include the disqualification of Mr. Ustyugov's results from the Olympic Games 2014, in which he won a gold medal," the group said.
Fallout from the doping program has cut the number of Russian medals won at the 2014 games the country hosted. The supremacy in gold medals in Sochi has been a point of national pride, as high Olympic medal counts have long been for Russia and the Soviet Union.

Veterans Affairs faces turmoil again Firing of deputy secretary latest in string of incidents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump enters his reelection year, his administration's focus on the nation's veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than 9 million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray.
The mysterious firing this month of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest Cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care.
The department's secretary, Robert Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. That led the House Veterans Affairs Committee to file a complaint with the department's inspector general, charging that Wilkie tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a former reserve Navy intelligence officer. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistleblowers often retaliated against them instead.
A health program central to the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of care outside the department's health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan's coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it.
Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches.
Several who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Wilkie's inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department, as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics.
The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans' service organizations, which have sparred with Wilkie as their influence has waned.
"There is a leadership challenge going on over there," said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. "The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk."
More ominous for Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration's veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department's traditional medical centers.
Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former Veterans Department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans' health care led to scandals and tragedies.
"We are going to be really watching over the next six months," said Dan Caldwell, the group's senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet.
While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems.
The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years.
Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center's cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department's Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges.
Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Rep. Mark Takano of California, the committee's chairman, denouncing the claim as "unsubstantiated" and chastising Takano for bringing it to the fore.
In an unusual rebuke, Michael Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Wilkie to say that characterizing Goldstein's allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect.
Four people with direct knowledge said that Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Goldstein's claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general.
Senior aides to Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Goldstein.
"The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known," said Pam Powers, Wilkie's chief of staff. "At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein's background."
The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members - in at least one case a medical director - of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers.
A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Wilkie then told Byrne that he had "lost confidence" in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign.
"For 2 1/2 years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the VA providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans," Byrne said.
No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal.
"The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why," said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. "It is mind-blowing."

Sculptor defied stereotypes, found airy beauty in steel, stone

Texto completo: Beverly Pepper, an American painter turned sculptor who transformed tons of steel and stone into airy creations that enlivened the public spaces they occupied and were displayed in some of the most important art museums in the world, died Feb. 5 at her home and studio in Todi, Italy. She was 97.
Her daughter, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Jorie Graham, confirmed the death and said she did not know the cause.
Ms. Pepper embarked on her artistic career in Europe in the late 1940s, just as the continent emerged from World War II. For decades, she lived in Italy, where her proximity to that country's rich artistic tradition " and her distance from the sometimes cliquish contemporary American art world " combined to nurture the innovative style that was immediately recognizable as hers.
Ms. Pepper worked in media including steel, iron, bronze and stone and was one of the first sculptors to employ Cor-Ten steel, a material that assumes a striking reddish-brown hue after oxidizing. With those materials, she created massive arcing curves, majestic columns and mirrored prisms " forms whose apparent weightlessness disguised the heft of the materials from which they were made.
'You have to have the brains to outwit a lot of the material you work, particularly iron, which I love,' she once told the New York Times. 'Cast iron is very tough material, as is stone, you have to outwit it. That's the beauty of it, you see.'
Ms. Pepper's works were displayed in museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institution's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, among other leading institutions. But they made perhaps their greatest impact when they were displayed in settings such as the piazzas at the heart of many Italian cities.

For Todi, the Umbrian town near Perugia where she lived and worked for years, she created 'The Todi Columns,' a grouping of four sculptures ranging from more than 28 feet to nearly 36 feet in height. First displayed in 1979, they were erected again in the town last year.
'For all their modern poise, once installed, the four 'Todi Columns' might always have been there,' journalist Megan O'Grady wrote in the Times in 2019, describing them as 'relics not from the 1970s but the Iron Age, the kind of archaeological remnants that make you aware of your own minuteness in the larger human project.'
Similar in spirit to 'The Todi Columns' were Ms. Pepper's cast-iron 'Manhattan Sentinels' created for New York City's Federal Plaza. For Barcelona, she designed 'Sol I Ombra Park,' a sprawling outdoor space featuring pyramidal and totem-like forms.
Ms. Pepper was often the only woman among the welders and other workers in the factories where her artwork took shape. Once, a blacksmith agreed to work with her on the condition that she use a man's name " George. In Italy, she asked that she be described as a 'scultore,' rather than the feminine form of the noun, 'scultrice.'
She traced her comfort in her traditionally male-dominated field to the examples set by women in her family including her mother, who volunteered with the NAACP.

'I wasn't brought up thinking I had to be a 'feminine' woman,' Ms. Pepper told the Sunday Telegraph of London. 'There was nothing I ever thought would limit me because my mother and grandmother were very strong women. I didn't know that's not how women acted!'
Beverly Stoll, a granddaughter of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 20, 1922. Her father, a small-time boxer, sold flooring and later fur coats. Her mother helped support the family by taking in laundry.
Ms. Pepper was drawn to the arts in her youth, but her mother assumed all artists to be starving ones, Ms. Pepper recalled to the Times, and encouraged her to pursue a profession that would allow her to support herself.
She enrolled at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where she studied industrial design but was not permitted to operate machinery because she was a woman, she told the website Artnet.
She entered the advertising field and rose to become vice president and art director at a New York firm. But she was deeply unhappy.
'We used to sit around conference rooms for hours on end, waiting for a client to show up,' she told Time magazine. 'And then we all had to bow down like he was God. I used to wear low-heeled shoes so I wouldn't be taller than the men.'
On the advice of a psychiatrist, she left her job and moved to Paris. She studied painting under André Lhote and Fernand Léger and trained at Le Cordon Bleu, the noted cooking school, later penning several cookbooks.
Her early paintings belonged to the school of social realism, the artistic movement that sought to make political commentary often by depicting poverty and deprivation such as Ms. Pepper observed in postwar Europe.
'At times melancholy, at times naive, the artist pictures the life of the poor . . . in such a way as to give us a poetic image,' an Italian critic, Virgilio Guzzi, wrote in a commentary cited by Time in 1952.
In 1949, she married Curtis Bill Pepper, then an art student and later a journalist who served as Newsweek magazine's Mediterranean bureau chief, based in Rome. Ms. Pepper reveled in the intellectual ferment of the era, befriending filmmakers including Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni and once playing poker with Sophia Loren.
But her primary passion was her art. When the Times profiled Ms. Pepper last year, Graham recalled her mother burning holes in her long white leather gloves because she could not tear herself away from her soldering before an evening affair.
She had turned to sculpture from painting after travels through Cambodia, where she was captivated by the sculptures and carvings of the temple of Angkor Wat. 'I walked into Angkor Wat a painter,' she told the Times, 'and I left a sculptor.'

In 1962, she was invited to participate in a sculptural exhibition in the Italian city of Spoleto that was to feature works by such noted artists as Henry Moore, Alexander Calder and David Smith. Ms. Pepper was undeterred by the requirement that all participants be trained in welding.
'I lied,' she told the Sunday Telegraph. 'I figured I could learn between then and the show.' Indeed, she found a blacksmith who agreed to teach her.
Reflecting on her work, Ms. Pepper told the Times that she wished for her creations to provide 'that sense of another dimension which you can walk into but there's nothing there except what you're walking into.'
One of her last projects was an amphitheater " she described it as an 'amphisculpture' " for L'Aquila, the Italian city that suffered a severe earthquake in 2009.
Her first marriage, to Lawrence Gussin, ended in divorce. Curtis Bill Pepper died in 2014. Survivors include their two children, Graham, of Cambridge, Mass., and John Randolph Pepper, a theater director and photographer, of Palermo, Italy; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
For all of the inspiration that she provided to women in the arts, Ms. Pepper said she was not warmly received by the feminist movement. Remembering an encounter with feminist activist Betty Friedan, she told the Times: 'She looked like a truck driver, that's the nicest thing I can say, and she said, 'Well, are you with us or are we not together?' I said, 'None of you invited me in!'-'
'I never start with the feeling that maybe I can't do it,' the art critic Phyllis Tuchman, writing for Artnews, recalled Ms. Pepper saying. 'I was brought up in a world where you had no choice, you had to try, there were no givens.'

Texto completo: Facing criticism, Justice says in apology he 'never dreamed' term 'would bother anyone'
Elected West Virginia governor in 2016 as the state's richest man, Jim Justice said he would give up control of his 102-business empire but vowed to keep his favorite hobby.
'There are three things I know that I can do,' he once said. 'That's shoot a shotgun, make a deal and coach basketball.'
West Virginia's top elected official still spends his winters pacing the sidelines at Greenbrier East High in Lewisburg, coaching the Spartans girls' basketball team, a volunteer position he has held since 2003. Now some residents are wishing he would watch his mouth while he does it.
Referees suspended a game between the Spartans and rival Woodrow Wilson High on Tuesday night after a disruption behind the Wilson bench in the fourth quarter. The incident ended with Wilson players wading into the stands before one of the team's coach pulled them off the floor. A Wilson assistant coach, Gene Nabors, was later cited by state police for obstructing an officer.
The game was suspended with Greenbrier East leading by six points, and Justice later called the Wilson players 'a bunch of thugs,' a remark some consider racist.
'I hate to say it any other way, but honest to God's truth is the same thing happened over at Woodrow two different times out of the Woodrow players. They're a bunch of thugs,' Justice told the Beckley Register-Herald. 'The whole team left the bench. The coach is in a fight. They walked off the floor. They called the game.
'The game was over when they walked off the floor " it's just as simple as that. They don't know how to behave, and at the end of the day, you got what you got.'
Justice later said in a statement it was 'totally absurd' to infer racial intent in his choice of words, but others criticized his postgame comments. He apologized Friday, saying he 'never dreamed' the term thugs 'would bother anyone.'
'First of all, I would tell them that I'm really sorry if I've done anything that has offended them,' the governor told local ABC affiliate WCHS. 'But secondly, I would just say this, Barack Obama used that term. Newspapers in our state have used the term. The New York Times uses that term all the time. I didn't know . . . I wouldn't have known in a million years. No way on this planet would I know. If we need to use another term we would say, you know if I could take it back, surely, I would take it back because you know, I never dreamed it would bother anyone.'
That apology, though, did not satisfy members of the Wilson community.
'That's not good enough,' assistant coach Kevin Henry told The Washington Post. 'He should apologize to our team.'
Rockey Powell, Wilson's principal, criticized Justice in a statement Saturday without mentioning the governor by name.
'Immediately following the game and in the days thereafter, Woodrow Wilson High School students have been subjected to unfortunate and inappropriate remarks by the coach of the Greenbrier East High School girls' basketball team,' Powell's statement read. 'The remarks show complete lack of respect for our students and coaches. We are proud of how our players and coaches have conducted themselves in the last few days throughout these unfortunate circumstances.'
Tensions between the teams, both ranked among the top 10 in the state by MaxPreps, already were high after a chippy matchup earlier in the season. In the January meeting at Wilson, Greenbrier East supporters voiced chants that Wilson coaches felt had racial overtones. Fans referred to Wilson as 'Woodrow Hoodrow,' Henry said, and sang the alphabet as Wilson players attempted free throws, which Wilson coaches interpreted as casting doubt on their players' literacy.
In a packed gymnasium Tuesday night " on a court named after Justice " tempers boiled over.
Steven Damon, a parent of a Greenbrier East player, appeared to taunt the Wilson bench during a timeout in the fourth quarter, and Gene Nabors " the brother of Wilson Coach Brian Nabors " then approached Wilson's principal and athletic director, asking them to intervene, according to his attorney and photos and video obtained by The Post.
The situation quickly escalated, ultimately leading West Virginia State Police officers, on duty to protect Justice, to walk across the court and confront Gene Nabors as he walked away. Nabors wound up handcuffed on the ground.
'He kind of nudged Gene, and words were exchanged and things escalated behind our bench,' Henry said. 'Gene's son came down from the stands, and Gene tried to say, 'It's all right,' and when Gene turned around, the state trooper pushed him to the ground and arrested him. I'd never seen anything like that.'
Henry pulled his team off the floor in an abundance of caution, he said, which led Justice to lobby officials to declare the game a forfeit, according to the Register-Herald. Instead, the game was suspended and will not count toward either team's record. Wilson won the teams' earlier meeting in January.
The teams could meet again in the coming sectional playoff tournament. Wilson administrators have asked state officials to play that game at a neutral site in Bluefield, about 70 miles southwest of Lewisburg.
On Thursday, five Wilson players were suspended two games each for leaving the bench during the altercation. West Virginia State Police also cited Donte Nabors, Gene Nabors's son, for disorderly conduct and obstructing an officer and Damon for disorderly conduct.
Some residents around the state remained uneasy with Justice's description of the Wilson team. Greenbrier East's student body is 89-percent white and 5 percent black, according to enrollment data; Wilson, located in nearby Beckley, has a student body that is 72 percent white and 19-percent black.
'The talk around town is just how terrible it was that the governor said what he said,' McGraw, the attorney, told The Post in a phone interview. Two of his children graduated from Wilson. 'Woodrow Wilson is coached by two black men, and the majority of the girls on the team are black women. People are pretty upset that the governor would say those kind of things.
'Thugs, that's a modern day term for the n-word. At least around here it is,' McGraw added.
Asked whether Justice's words appeared racially motivated, Henry said: 'In a cultural sense, yes, I thought so. But is Jim Justice a racist? I don't know. . . . I've been in tears for the past couple days. I think he knows better.'
The incident appeared to divide West Virginians. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D) contacted Wilson coaches to offer support, Henry said, as have other local politicians. Nabors's attorney, meanwhile, received a number of menacing phone messages using racial slurs at his law office.
Justice, himself a graduate of Wilson High, has said repeatedly his choice of words had no racist intent.
'My definition of a thug is clear " it means violence, bullying, and disorderly conduct,' he said in a statement before issuing his apology. 'And we, as West Virginians, should have zero tolerance for this kind of behavior. Anyone that would accuse me of making a racial slur is totally absurd.'

Texto completo: read their autobiographies to find what works best
It's been roughly 1,100 days since Barack Obama was president, a number that means different things to different people " be they Democrats, Republicans or readers of any party. Like so many of his predecessors, Obama signed up to write a presidential memoir, but he's running late, at least by the standards of the genre. His publisher has yet to announce a title or even a publication date. George W. Bush's 'Decision Points,' by contrast, came out roughly 600 days after he left office.
There have been presidential autobiographies for nearly as long as there have been American presidents. Four of the first five chief executives tried to write their life stories, with Washington the only holdout. But political memoirs create a peculiar set of problems for their authors. Two hundred years of history make the temptation clear: to emphasize the politics at the expense of the memoir. But that history also provides some useful tips if Obama and other political memoirists will consider them.
Washington's characteristic reticence left John Adams to go first. His book, which he began not long after Thomas Jefferson defeated him in the 1800 election, offers the first lesson for Obama: Personal writing doesn't mean you have to focus on personal grievances. Adams intended his book for posthumous publication, but his voice was snappy and lively, a quality Obama might aspire to. Still, Adams frequently squandered it on arguments with his former rivals. Instead of describing the Revolutionary War, for instance, he got distracted by attacking Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Paine. The ex-president picked fights for more than 400 pages. He never finished his book.
Over the next few decades, a handful of presidents joined the founders in attempting autobiographies, but they each ended up with a text that was grumpy, defensive and incomplete. The Civil War changed that " the incomplete part, at least. After leaving the White House in 1861, James Buchanan searched for an author to answer his many detractors. (Slamming the former president had become a rare activity that united North and South.) Eventually, he finished the book on his own, blaming the war on abolitionists, reporters, generals " on everyone, in short, but himself.
Buchanan's memoir astonished readers, by appearing so quickly and also by being terrible. 'Instead of trusting his enemy to write a book,' the New York Times marveled, 'he deliberately writes the story of his own and his government's dishonor himself!'
In the years after the Civil War, more and more politicians and generals agreed to publish autobiographies during their lifetimes. The most popular entry came from Ulysses S. Grant, who was driven to the project by his bankruptcy " and barely finished it because of a fatal cancer. Despite these challenges, Grant wrote a book that's generally seen as the greatest presidential memoir, though it focused on his time as a general. 'Personal Memoirs' provided meticulous accounts of Grant's battles. But the most memorable passages came in his descriptions of others " meeting with Abraham Lincoln, meeting with Robert E. Lee. That's the second quality Obama might consider: short but memorable character sketches of his contemporaries.
The other thing about 'Personal Memoirs' that should interest Obama is its anemic impact on Grant's legacy. When the book appeared in 1885, it sold more copies than just about any other title in American history. Before long, however, Grant's military reputation began to falter. 'Personal Memoirs' couldn't reverse the image pushed by pro-Southern historians: that Grant was a blundering butcher.
And yet America's presidents kept writing. When Theodore Roosevelt published his 'Autobiography' in 1913, he inaugurated a streak in which, with the partial exceptions of William Howard Taft and George H.W. Bush, every president who's left the White House in good health has gone on to publish a memoir. These books have often repeated the problems present in Adams's, obsessing over enemies and wallowing in self-justifications. Before he began writing, Roosevelt chatted with a novelist about his upcoming book. 'I have no desire to get even with anybody,' Roosevelt said. Once he started writing, though, he couldn't help it. The author compared himself to Lincoln; he compared his opponents to Buchanan.
There's one surprising exception: 'The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge,' which appeared in 1929. While Coolidge's book is forgotten today " as is Coolidge's presidency, to be honest " it was a sensation in its own era. His contemporaries had always celebrated his writing. (The only thing H.L. Mencken liked about the 30th president, it seemed, was his literary style.) So the country's biggest magazines entered a bidding war to publish the first excerpt from the eventual book, and Cosmopolitan, then a general-interest magazine, came out on top. On the morning the winning issue went on sale, Coolidge's wife, Grace, went out early to buy a copy at her local newsstand. It was a good thing " by the end of the day the issue had essentially disappeared nationwide. Scalpers were selling it for several times the cover price; at the magazine's headquarters, requests for additional inventory came from 1,900 cities.
The passage that had everyone buzzing centered on Calvin Jr., the Coolidges' teenage son. Early in his father's presidency, Calvin Jr. developed a small blister while playing on the White House lawn, a blister that became infected and ultimately killed him. Now his father recounted the experience: 'In his suffering, he was asking me to make him well. I could not.' The most powerful person in America admitted that he'd felt powerless " that, even years later, he remained lacerated and unsure. 'If I had not been President,' Coolidge wrote, 'he would not have raised a blister.' As he put it in the article's final line, 'It costs a great deal to be President.'
Coolidge's book rarely defended his presidency, but it presented a revealing portrait of his time in office. In fact, it contained a number of qualities Obama might want to borrow. It was modest. It was short. Most of all, it highlighted the human side of Coolidge's presidency, capturing things only he could know.
On some level, every ex-president has realized that this is the right approach. But they never follow through. When Dwight Eisenhower started working on his contribution, he promised a 'personal memoir' " something that would skip the self-justifications to tell an intimate story. Then Eisenhower wrote a two-volume tome that was as windy and indulgent as any of his predecessors' books. When the first volume appeared, two weeks before John F. Kennedy's assassination, it was widely discussed, including at the White House. Kennedy chuckled at Eisenhower's self-righteous tone. 'Apparently he never did anything wrong,' the president told an aide. 'When we come to writing the memoirs of this administration, we'll do it differently.'
Kennedy never got the chance, but his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, also pledged a 'personal' book. That's become the favored description of one's presidential memoir " Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton used the word, as well " but it's one of the emptiest promises in politics.
Perhaps Obama is wrestling with these same authorial impulses. His previous works prove he's a terrific and personal writer, whose first book, 'Dreams From My Father,' told a lyrical story while hinting at bigger themes.
But presidential memoirs present different challenges. Obama's readers will of course want to know his thoughts on his administration and what's come after. But Obama can address those topics personally without bogging down in bland play-by-play. He doesn't need to summarize every fight with Mitch McConnell, especially since Obama's personality makes it seem unlikely that he would write about those squabbles in the gossipy way Adams wrote about Hamilton. Instead, Obama might explore what it felt like to campaign on a promise of unity, only to see that promise undone by broader political forces. He might describe what he thought and how he changed as he watched his deepest beliefs backfire.
What Obama should do, in other words, is write a book like Coolidge's. After all, attacking one's opponents and vindicating one's polices doesn't really work. Even a memoir as good (and as popular) as Grant's couldn't secure him a favorable legacy. But that's a cause less for despair than for relief " an excuse to write something shorter and rawer, something more intimate, something that really is 'personal' " and that present-day readers will love to read. Don't expound upon your theory of executive power " show what it felt like to be the executive. Reveal the presidency's private side. Leave the rest to the historians.

No, radical policies won't drive election-winning turnout

Texto completo: A progressive call to arms may also summon the right, warns demographer
No myth is stronger in progressive circles than the magical, wonderworking powers of voter turnout. It's become a sort of pixie dust that you sprinkle over your strenuously progressive positions to ward off any suggestion that they might turn off voters. That is how Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), now the Democratic presidential front-runner, has dealt with criticism that his more unpopular stances " including eliminating private health insurance, decriminalizing the border and covering undocumented immigrants in a government health plan " might cost him the votes he needs to beat President Trump.
Sanders's explanation of why this is not a problem is simple, and he has repeated it endlessly. When a member of the Los Angeles Times editorial board asked him whether 'a candidate as far to the left as you' would 'alienate swing voters and moderates and independents,' the senator replied: 'The only way that you beat Trump is by having an unprecedented campaign, an unprecedentedly large voter turnout.' Faiz Shakir, Sanders's campaign manager, adds: 'Bernie Sanders has very unique appeal amongst [the younger] generation and can inspire, I think, a bunch of them to vote in percentages that they have never voted before.'
This has remarkably little empirical support. Take the 2018 midterm elections, in which the Democrats took back the House (a net 40-seat gain), carried the House popular vote by almost nine points and flipped seven Republican-held governorships. Turnout in that election was outstanding, topping 49-percent " the highest midterm turnout since 1914 and up 13 points over the previous midterm, in 2014 " and the demographic composition of the electorate came remarkably close to that of a presidential election year. (Typically, midterm voters tend to be much older and much whiter than those in presidential elections.) This was due both to fewer presidential 'drop-off' voters (people who voted in 2016 but not 2018) and to more midterm 'surge' voters (those who voted in 2018 but not 2016).
Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the Democrats' improved performance came not from fresh turnout of left-of-center voters, who typically skip midterms, but rather from people who cast votes in both elections " yet switched from Republican in 2016 to Democratic in 2018. The data firm Catalist, whose numbers on 2018 are the best available, estimates that 89 percent of the Democrats' improved performance came from persuasion " from vote-switchers " not turnout. In its analysis, Catalist notes, 'If turnout was the only factor, then Democrats would not have seen nearly the gains that they ended up seeing … a big piece of Democratic victory was due to 2016 Trump voters turning around and voting for Democrats in 2018 .'
Crucially, Democrats in 2018, especially the successful ones, did not run on particularly radical programs but rather on opposition to Trump himself, and to unpopular GOP actions on economic policy and health care (tax cuts for the rich and efforts to repeal Obamacare's protections, for example). In the end, the 2018 results do not support Sanders's theories " not the central importance of high turnout, nor the supposed non-importance of changing mainstream voters' minds, nor the most effective issues to run on.
Or take 2016. Many pundits, including Steve Phillips of Democracy in Color, have suggested that Hillary Clinton failed to inspire core Democratic voters " notably African Americans " and that a more progressive candidate would have done so (and won). 'The Democratic Party's fixation on pursuing those who voted for Mr. Trump is a fool's errand,' Phillips wrote. But an analysis using data from the States of Change project, sponsored by, among others, the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress, indicates that, even if black turnout in the 2016 election had matched that of 2012 (it dropped from 62 to 57 percent), Clinton would have still lost. On the other hand, if she had managed to reduce her losses among white noncollege voters by a mere one-quarter, she'd be president today. That's an issue of persuasion, not turnout.
What's more, States of Change data does not suggest that youth turnout, which Sanders promises to increase so significantly, was a particular Democratic problem in 2016. In fact, young voters (ages 18 to 29) increased their turnout more than any other age group in that election, from 42 percent in 2012 to 44-percent in 2016. They also increased " if only slightly " their margin of support for the Democratic candidate. In 2016, the age cohort that really killed Democrats was voters ages 45 to 64, who had split evenly in 2012 but leaned Republican by six percentage points four years later. Sanders's bouquet of unpopular positions hardly seems likely to help the Democrats make up ground among these voters.
But perhaps 2020 will be different if a Sanders candidacy can truly catalyze massive turnout. Then Democrats won't have to worry about persuading Obama-Trump voters or anyone else in the 'swing' category. Wrong!
As Nate Cohn of the New York Times has noted after scrutinizing the data, it's a mistake to assume that Democrats would benefit disproportionately from high turnout. Trump is particularly strong among white noncollege voters, who dominate the pool of nonvoters in many areas of the country, including in key Rust Belt states. If the 2020 election indeed has historically high turnout, as many analysts expect, that spike could include many of these white noncollege voters in addition to Democratic-leaning constituencies such as nonwhites and young voters. The result could be an increase in Democrats' popular-vote total " and another loss in the electoral college.
This analysis shreds an implicit assumption of Sanders and other members of the turnout-will-solve-everything crowd: that if they polarize the election by highlighting progressive issues, 'their' nonvoters will show up at the polls, but none of the nonvoters from the other side will. That view is also contradicted by many political science studies. Stanford political scientists Andrew Hall and Daniel Thompson, for example, studied House races between 2006 and 2014 and found that highly ideological candidates who beat moderates for a party nomination indeed increased turnout in their own party in the general election " but they increased the opposition turnout even more. (The difference was between three and eight percentage points.) Apparently, their extreme political stances did more to turn out the other side to vote against them than to turn out their own side to vote for them.
The turnout equation does not necessarily return positive results for a candidate like Sanders. The reverse is more likely. It is truly magical thinking to believe that, in a highly polarized situation, only your side gets to increase turnout.

Texto completo: A revelatory book about the rise and fall of the world's biggest bank might hold some interest to financiers, business school professors and readers of the Economist. But what about one that also has all the elements of a page-turning mystery novel: suspicious suicides, Russian money laundering, securities and tax fraud, price fixing, $100 million bonuses, whistleblowers who are ignored and fired, and a heroin junkie peddling stolen documents to journalists and FBI agents? Add to that a big client with a sketchy financial history who suddenly becomes president of the United States, and you've got the makings of a blockbuster.
Indeed, it must have occurred to David Enrich, an enterprising business reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, that he couldn't have made up a more intriguing tale than the story he uncovered at Deutsche Bank. The result, 'Dark Towers,' is a real-life account that will confirm every suspicion you have about the greed and incompetence at the heart of modern finance.
Enrich traces the history of Deutsche Bank, from its entrepreneurial roots in the 19th century through its years of Nazi collaboration to the postwar decades when it stood at the nexus of political and economic relationships known as Germany, Inc. But in the 1990s, with its purchase of investment banks in London (Morgan Grenfell) and New York (Bankers Trust), Deutsche Bank began to shed its conservative culture and rush headlong into the more risky and lucrative areas of Anglo-American finance: derivatives, asset-backed securities, junk bond underwriting and proprietary trading

Before long, trading and fee-driven service businesses would overtake traditional corporate lending and account for a majority of Deutsche Bank's revenue and profits. Besides becoming the world's largest bank, with $2 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank also became one of the world's most heavily indebted. And with a decentralized management model and few controls in place, the lure of even greater profits and bonuses quickly led to legal and financial disasters:
A new Russian subsidiary laundered tens of billions of rubles into dollars for Russian oligarchs and cronies of President Vladimir Putin. Its London traders helped organize a conspiracy to fix interest rates. Its New York investment bankers were at the front of the pack peddling collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and mortgage-backed securities they knew would go bad. Its bankers conspired with corporate clients to evade economic sanctions against Iran and Syria, and helped giant hedge funds avoid taxes in the United States. Its enormous stash of risky derivatives was carried on its books at prices well above their market value. And its top executives repeatedly lied about all these things to investors, regulators and even their own directors.
The consequences of all this risk-taking, mismanagement and fraud are now clear. Between 2015 and 2017, the bank was forced to record losses of more than $10 billion, and it only barely returned to profitability in 2018. Since 2007, its stock price has fallen 95 percent. And as Enrich reports, the bank's financial position was so precarious that even longtime corporate customers abandoned it. The International Monetary Fund recently singled out Deutsche Bank as the institution posing the biggest risk to the global banking system.
Emblematic of the bank's problems has been its relationship with Donald Trump, who by the mid-1990s had stiffed so many lenders over the years as a real estate developer that no other bank would have anything to do with him. An initial loan of $125 million in 1998 to rehabilitate an office building at 40 Wall Street was followed by $900 million more for the GM Building on Fifth Avenue and a tower across from the United Nations. And when Trump was on the verge of defaulting on loans used to buy his failing hotels and casinos in Atlantic City, Deutsche Bank came to the rescue by peddling $484 million in junk bonds to investors " bonds on which Trump defaulted within a year.
Normally, such a default would have been enough to scare away even the most risk-tolerant lenders. But within months, Deutsche Bank's real estate division was again providing Trump with a $640 million loan needed to build a new Chicago hotel, while its team in Moscow was steering Russian investors to Trump projects in Hawaii and Mexico. The relationship hit a low point in 2009 when Trump announced he had no intention of repaying his loan on the Chicago hotel, claiming that the unfolding financial crisis was an act of God that freed him of his obligation. When Deutsche Bank sued to get its money back, Trump countersued, preposterously accusing the bank of predatory lending practices. The matter was finally settled with a two-year extension on the loan " and a vow by the bank's real estate lenders never to do business with Trump again. But two years later, Trump somehow sweet-talked his way into Deutsche's private banking division, which over the next several years provided him with $350 million in personal loans to cover projects in Chicago, Miami and Washington.
'The fact that one arm of Deutsche refused to do business with Trump and another arm considered him a marquee client was a perfect illustration of the bank's dysfunction,' Enrich writes.
Whatever financial risks the bank might have taken with its marquee client, however, would soon pale compared with the regulatory and reputational risks it took on when Trump won the 2016 election. Even now, the Supreme Court is considering whether the bank must turn over records from its Trump files to the House of Representatives. Trump sued to block the bank from complying with the House subpoena.
All of this certainly provides material for a book with both popular and professional appeal, but in the end Enrich can't quite pull it off. Part of the problem is that the demands of constructing a compelling, dramatic narrative lead him to ignore too much about the bank's operations, its financial performance and what else was happening in the industry to put these dramatic events in context and make it a credible business history.
Enrich organizes the book around the career of one banker, Bill Broeksmit, and a handful of colleagues who were involved in some, but not all, of the bank's risky and unsavory activities. Broeksmit's suicide provides the dramatic opening scene for the book, and the search by his troubled stepson for the story behind the act takes up the final third, bringing it to an unresolved ending. We are meant to conclude that Broeksmit took his life because his repeated efforts to prevent Deutsche Bank's excesses had failed. But in the end, the stories of the bank and the banker do not track each other in a way that feels true and convincing.
Enrich certainly did a tremendous amount of reporting, relying on internal documents, public records and scores of mostly off-the-record interviews that are only occasionally footnoted. And by the end, the reader is left with a clear impression that the people running the world's largest bank were all fools and knaves. Some on-the-record conversation with them would have either confirmed such a conclusion or provided the author and readers with a more complete and nuanced picture.
The biggest shortcoming of 'Dark Towers,' however, is that while it raises provocative questions about Deutsche Bank and Trump, it never quite answers them. Was it incompetence or corruption that caused American and European regulators to do nothing about the bank's excessive leverage and mispricing of assets? Was Trump's relationship with Justin Kennedy, head of Deutsche Bank's real estate lending division, a factor in the decision of Kennedy's father, Justice Anthony Kennedy, to retire from the Supreme Court and Trump's decision to appoint one of his former clerks, Brett Kavanaugh, to replace him? Did Deutsche Bank help Russian oligarchs launder money through Trump's projects? Why did the U.S. criminal investigation of the bank's Russian money laundering suddenly go quiet after Trump's election?
Although it might have taken months of additional reporting to nail down the answers to these questions, 'Dark Towers' would have been better for it. Instead, we are left to surmise that where there is smoke, there must also be fire.

From the Newsroom Not all news is bad for newspapers

Texto completo: The New York Times has $800 million in digital revenue. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)
Although no one in their right mind would ever hire me to run a business, as The Columbian's former business editor, I like to keep tabs on what some companies are doing.
Specifically, I like to see what newspaper companies are doing. Two recent stories in the news left me a little confused and wondering whether I see a silver lining in those financial clouds, or just another five years of dense fog for our industry.
Let's start with the silver. The New York Times just reported it generated more than $800 million in digital revenue last year, achieving its 2020 goal a year early.
Only five years ago, The Times' online revenue was half that figure. Now, $400 million in digital revenue isn't bad (although President Donald Trump once labeled the company as “failing,”) but doubling it in four years is amazing.
It's especially amazing for a company in an industry that overall continues to experience reduced revenues, particularly in advertising.
To put it another way, The Times added 1 million new digital subscribers, bringing its paid audience to 5.25 million across all platforms. The digital audience is particularly lucrative for news publishers, because additional subscribers can be served with very few increases in costs to the business. You don't have to buy newsprint and ink, print a paper every day and then drive it to a digital subscriber's home.
To its credit, The Times has apparently reinvested a lot of its revenue into its news operation. It now employs 1,700 journalists, the most it's ever had, and up from 1,300 a few years ago.
Despite its success, there were some bumps. Starbucks' decision to quit selling newspapers at its U.S. stores hurt The Times' single-copy sales revenue (it hurt ours, too) and the company's advertising revenue fell last year, reflecting the industrywide trend. “The Times is a subscription-first publisher,” CEO Mark Thompson said in a conference call with happy stock analysts. “Woe betide the newspaper that isn't.”
At the rate it is going, The New York Times is more giddyap than woe.
More woeful is what happened to the newspapers owned by Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha” whose business sense and investments made him into one of the world's richest people. I have long admired him, and when he declared a few years ago that he believed in local newspapers and put some of his money into buying more of them, it made me feel great.
Alas, the oracle no longer foresees such a bright future. Recently, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding company sold its newspapers to Lee Enterprises, a midsized chain of community papers that includes The Daily News in Longview and several small-town dailies in Oregon.
From what I can tell, it looks like Lee got a great deal. Lee has been managing BH's newspapers under a contract for the last year or two, and it now will own them at a bargain price. On top of that, Buffett's company also refinanced all of Lee's debt, which was around $400 million, and provided some operating capital, to boot.
Though Lee and its stockholders will benefit, I can't see it as a boost for local newspapers. Lee says it expects $20 million to $25 million in “synergies” from the merger, which sounds to me like some employees will be losing their jobs.
These kinds of deals make me very happy to work for The Columbian, one of the increasingly rare examples of a locally owned newspaper. The Campbells will celebrate their 100th anniversary of family ownership next year. Four of the five owners — Scott, Jody, Ben and Will — work here, so you can see their level of commitment to their business and to Southwest Washington.
It's still a tough go for the newspaper business, but some of the premier players are finding their way. It will be up to us smaller fry to do

California, and its exiles, take revenge on Trump

Texto completo: President Donald Trump clearly hates the most populous state in the country he governs. While trashing California with his gutter mouth, the president has used his office to physically trash the home to nearly one in eight Americans — seeking to make its air more polluted, its water less clean, its forests more vulnerable to catastrophic fires.
But now the Golden State is poised to strike back. By moving its presidential primary from June to March 3, California will finally exert a political influence commensurate to its size. Almost 500 delegates, a fourth of the number needed to win the Democratic nomination, are at stake.
Perhaps more consequential — or at least overlooked — is the vast diaspora of more than 7.3 million people who have left California since 2007. They appear to be changing the political makeup of the states they’ve moved to.
With nearly 40 million people, California is still gaining population — barely. But stratospheric home prices and unbearable rental costs have created a reverse “Grapes of Wrath,” forcing many to flee to states with much lower costs of living.
The question is: Are they bringing California values — fierce defense of the environment, tolerance of immigrants and a multiracial society, insistence on universal health care — with them?
If you look at the changing politics of Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, all fast-growing states packed with new arrivals from California, the answer is yes. Texas may not be far behind.
In Nevada, Democrats won the governor’s mansion, a second U.S. Senate seat in 2018, and prevailed in the last three presidential races.
Colorado, another favorite landing spot for those who can no longer afford California, is now reliably blue. The state is likely to flip a Senate seat, bouncing the inept Republican Cory Gardner for a popular former governor, John Hickenlooper.
Arizona could be the next to fall to Democrats. The state known for retirees and tax-averse whites is becoming more diverse and younger and full of ex-Californians. In 2018, quirky Kyrsten Sinema became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat since 1988, with a victory margin of about 56,000 votes.
Looking at this year’s electoral map, Arizona is a wild card. I’ve long believed that it’s better to win back the 80,000 votes that proved to be the winning margin for Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan than to grow another two million progressives on the coasts.
But if the Dems were to win Arizona’s 11 Electoral College votes, as polls show they could, and lose Wisconsin’s 10, while getting back Pennsylvania and Michigan, that would be enough to remove the vile and corrupt man occupying the White House.
Texas, the top state for California exiles, will probably come up short for Democrats this year, though it’s in play. Democrats have a growing advantage in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
Bullying and berating California is good politics for Trump. The rest of the country has little sympathy for the “sunbaked barbarians,” as an old friend in Seattle used to call them.
Yet Californians, those who still proudly call it home and those who left their hearts there, could be the force that sends him packing.

Texto completo: Almost everybody admires the Nordic model. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have high economic productivity, high social equality, high social trust and high levels of personal happiness.
Progressives say it’s because they have generous welfare states. Some libertarians point out that these countries score high on nearly every measure of free market openness. Immigration restrictionists note that until recently they were ethnically homogeneous societies.
But Nordic nations were ethnically homogeneous in 1800 when they were dirt poor.
Their economic growth took off just after 1870, way before their welfare states were established.
What really launched the Nordic nations was generations of phenomenal educational policy.
The 19th-century Nordic elites did something we haven’t been able to do in this country recently. They realized that if their countries were to prosper they had to create truly successful “folk schools” for the least educated among them.
They look at education differently than we do. The German word they used to describe their approach, bildung, doesn’t even have an English equivalent. It means the complete moral, emotional, intellectual and civic transformation of the person.
It was based on the idea that if people were going to be able to contribute to an emerging industrial society, they would need more complex inner lives.
Today, Americans often think of schooling as the transmission of specialized skills — can the student read, do math, recite the facts of biology. Bildung is devised to change how students see the world, to help them understand complex systems and see the relations between things — between self and society, between a community of relationships in a family and a town.
The Nordic educators also worked hard to develop the student’s internal awareness. Their intuition was that as people grow, they have the ability to go through developmental phases, to see themselves and the world through ever more complex lenses. A young child may blindly obey authority — Mom, Dad, teacher. Then she internalizes and conforms to the norms of the group. Then she learns to create her own norms based on her own values. Then she learns to see herself as a node in a network of selves and thus learns mutuality and holistic thinking.
The idea was to create in the mind of the student an eagerness to assume shared responsibility for the whole.
That educational push seems to have had a lasting influence on the culture. Scandinavians have the lowest rates of corruption in the world.
They have a distinctive sense of the relationship between personal freedom and communal responsibility.
In the U.S., social trust has been on the decline for decades. If the children of privilege get to go to the best schools, there’s not going to be much social mutuality. If those schools do not instill a love of nation, there’s not going to be much shared responsibility.
When you look at the Nordic bildung model, you realize our problem is not only that we don’t train people with the right job skills. It’s that we don’t have the right lifelong development model to instill the mode of consciousness people need to thrive in a complex pluralistic society.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders’s early primary success has the business community fretting about the anti-inequality economic policies he would champion if he wins the White House and starting to speak out against him.
“I’m afraid, eventually, that the middle class and small businesses will suffer,” said small businessman Josh Malone, who invented Bunch O Balloons, a device that fills 100 balloons with water and ties them within a minute.
Malone is not alone in his assessment of Sanders. A majority of small-business owners favor President Trump winning the White House over Sanders come November, 52% to 48%, respectively, according to a recent poll by Gallup and payment processor Square Inc. The same poll showed small-business owners favoring former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 52% to 48%.
Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was the first high-profile businessman out of the gate on Wednesday, following Sanders's victory in New Hampshire, to criticize the Vermont senator. Blankfein tweeted that Sanders is “as polarizing as Trump” and that his policies will “ruin our economy.” He also said that Russia should “go with Sanders this time around” if they want to “screw up the US.”
Trump on Wednesday admitted that he would rather face Bloomberg in November than Sanders.
"Frankly, I would rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders because Sanders has real followers, whether you like them or not, whether you agree with them or not," he said.
In the swing state of Florida, Sanders loses ground among small-business owners when facing Trump. Only 40% of respondents backed him while the president won 60%, according to a different Square poll.
For Malone, his issue with Sanders is the tax increases he supports.
“That sort of money is not just sitting around to be turned over; it’s got to come from somewhere. It’s going to affect [economic] growth,” he said, adding, “I don’t think there are enough resources to accomplish his plans without tapping into the middle class.”
One account from a conservative budget expert shows Sanders’s priorities costing an additional $97.5 trillion in government spending over the next decade. In comparison, the federal government is currently projected to spend $60.7 trillion between now and 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the right-of-center Tax Foundation, said that Sanders’s proposals are getting attention on Capitol Hill, where legislators and aides wonder if the plans are feasible.
“There is widespread concern about the whole workability on any potential effects of any particular tax proposal,” he said, adding that “there definitely is attention on the cumulative size on what someone like Sen. Sanders is proposing.”
For big businesses, criticizing Sanders is risky because it could have the side effect of boosting him in the Democratic primary. A recent example is what happened when the Super PAC Democratic Majority for Israel ran an ad against Sanders saying that he could not beat Trump in a general election. His campaign said it raised more than $1.3 million because of the ad, according to the New York Times.
At a certain point, though, the reward of opposing Sanders is worth the risk of seeing an attack backfire.
William Cohan, the author of Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World and a former investment banker, said that supporting Sanders for president is a “bridge too far” for many business and Wall Street executives.
“I’ve had more than one Wall Street guy and more than one corporate CEO say, ‘Look, Bernie and Elizabeth Warren — I can’t go there. It’s a bridge too far,'" he said in an appearance on CNBC. "'I can do Pete [Buttigieg]. I can do [Amy] Klobuchar, or I can do Bloomberg. I cannot do Bernie or Elizabeth Warren, and, therefore, the devil I know, as much as I hate him, is better. His economic policies, I can live with — I can muddle through for another four years.'"
David McIntosh, president of the pro-business organization Club for Growth, said that it's still too early for most businesses to react to the prospect of a Sanders administration but that more will speak out if it appears he is on course to win the nomination. “If Bernie looks like he is going to become the nominee in June, that could put the brakes on economic expansion,” he said.
In addition to major new taxes, Sanders's platform also includes Medicare for All, free public college, and a sweeping Green New Deal environmental overhaul.
Former BP CEO Bob Dudley recently told CNBC that Sanders’s climate change plan was “unrealistic.”
“They have a completely unrealistic idea of the complexity of the global energy system,” he recently told CNBC.
Sanders responded to the comment by tweeting that Dudley was "unrealistic" to think that the senator would allow fossil fuel companies "to destroy the planet."
Of course, Sanders's campaign promises won't translate directly into law.
“It’s almost like what you’re seeing from a presidential candidate is an opening bid," said Mark Mazur, former Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy in the Obama administration and current director of the Brookings Tax Policy Center. "I think you get ahead of yourself a little bit in trying to speculate what a Sanders administration would be able to accomplish legislatively."
This week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a top campaign representative, acknowledged that Sanders would not be able to enact all the items in his agenda, a point that could assuage business fears. In particular, the New York Democrat noted, Sanders might have to compromise rather than insist on Medicare for All.

Paul Krugman: Sanders isn’t a socialist. Saying he is hurts his campaign.

Texto completo: Republicans have a long, disreputable history of conflating any attempt to improve American lives with the evils of “socialism.” When Medicare was first proposed, Ronald Reagan called it “socialized medicine,” and he declared that it would destroy our freedom. These days, if you call for something like universal child care, conservatives accuse you of wanting to turn America into the Soviet Union.
It’s a smarmy, dishonest political strategy, but it’s hard to deny that it has sometimes been effective. And now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination — not an overwhelming front-runner, but clearly the person most likely at the moment to come out on top — is someone who plays right into that strategy, by declaring that he is indeed a socialist.
The thing is, Bernie Sanders isn’t actually a socialist in any normal sense of the term. He doesn’t want to nationalize our major industries and replace markets with central planning; he has expressed admiration, not for Venezuela, but for Denmark. He’s basically what Europeans would call a social democrat — and social democracies like Denmark are, in fact, quite nice places to live, with societies that are, if anything, freer than our own.
So why does Sanders call himself a socialist? I’d say that it’s mainly about personal branding, with a dash of glee at shocking the bourgeoisie. And this self-indulgence did no harm as long as he was just a senator from a very liberal state.
But if Sanders becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, his misleading self-description will be a gift to the Trump campaign. So will his policy proposals. Single-payer health care is (a) a good idea in principle and (b) very unlikely to happen in practice, but by making “Medicare for All” the centerpiece of his campaign, Sanders would take the focus off the Trump administration’s determination to take away the social safety net we already have.
Just to be clear, if Sanders is indeed the nominee, the Democratic Party should give him its wholehearted support. He probably couldn’t turn America into Denmark, and even if he could, President Donald Trump is trying to turn us into a white nationalist autocracy like Hungary. Which would you prefer?
But I do wish that Sanders weren’t so determined to make himself an easy target for right-wing smears.
Speaking of unhelpful political posturing, the runner-up in New Hampshire has also been poisoning his own well. Over the past few days Pete Buttigieg has chosen to pose as a deficit hawk, thereby demonstrating that while he may be a fresh face, he has remarkably stale ideas.
Maybe Buttigieg is unaware of the growing consensus among mainstream economists that the deficit hysteria of seven or eight years ago was greatly overblown. Last year the former top economists in the Obama administration published an article titled “Who’s Afraid of Budget Deficits?” which concluded, “It’s time for Washington to put away its debt obsession and focus on bigger things.”
And where Sanders is playing right into one disreputable Republican political strategy, Buttigieg is playing into another: the strategy of hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity when a Democrat occupies the White House, then borrowing freely as soon as the GOP regains power. If Democrats win, they should pursue a progressive agenda, not waste political capital cleaning up the GOP’s mess.
Again, if Buttigieg somehow becomes the nominee, the party should back him without reservation. Whatever he may say about deficits, he wouldn’t do what Republicans do: use debt fears as an excuse to slash social programs.
So who will the Democrats nominate? Your guess is as good as mine. What’s really important, however, is that the party stays focused on its strengths and Trump’s weaknesses.
For the fact is that all of the Democrats who would be president, from Bloomberg to Bernie, are at least moderately progressive; they all want to maintain and expand the social safety net, while raising taxes on the wealthy. And all the polling evidence says that America is basically a center-left nation — which is why Trump promised to raise taxes on the rich and protect major social programs during the 2016 campaign.
But he was lying, and at this point everyone with an open mind knows it. So Democrats have a perfect opportunity to portray themselves, truthfully, as the defenders of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the now-popular Affordable Care Act against Republicans who are more or less nakedly favoring the interests of plutocrats over those of working families.
This opportunity will, however, be squandered if the Democratic nominee, whoever he or she is, turns the election into a referendum on either single-payer health care or deficit reduction, neither of which is an especially popular position. Things will be even worse if the Democrats themselves degenerate into squabbles over either ideological purity or fiscal probity.
The point is that whoever gets the nomination, Democrats need to build as broad a coalition as possible. Otherwise they’ll be handing the election to Trump — and that would be a tragedy for the party, the nation and the world.

Pete Buttigieg’s dash for cash: 10 fundraisers in two weeks, including a stop in Utah

Texto completo: In the compressed and crucial weeks between the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg is moving aggressively to replenish his campaign coffers with an ambitious schedule of 10 fundraisers held across six states in a 14-day period.
The money chase for Buttigieg began in Indianapolis on Thursday at the 16,000-square-foot home of a supporter as donors noshed on egg salad and cucumber sandwiches — “What a thrill to be back home again in Indiana,” Buttigieg said — and continued Friday in California, as he traveled from San Francisco to Silicon Valley to the state capital of Sacramento for a photo line with contributors.
He will soon visit Seattle; Salt Lake City; Los Angeles; the Washington, D.C., area; Miami; and Palm Beach, Florida — with most of the events built around states that will vote in early March.
[ Read More: Pete Buttigieg endorsed by Salt Lake County Mayor ]
In addition to Buttigieg himself, his national policy director, Sonal Shah, a veteran of the Obama administration and Goldman Sachs, is hitting the road to headline events in Virginia, Maryland and Ohio, where donors are asked for up to $2,800 to become a “champion” and join in a “policy conversation” (some tickets can be had for as little as $54). And Buttigieg’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, is featured at another five events, with two stops in Wisconsin, two in Denver and one in Phoenix.
The frenetic fundraising pace opens up Pete Buttigieg to potential criticism from progressives that he is the preferred candidate of the wealthy. That is a line of attack that both Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (“I don’t have 40 billionaires, Pete”) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (“The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals”) have relished in recent months.
A virtually unknown small-town mayor a year ago, Buttigieg built a sizable list of small online donors and a formidable big-bundler operation in 2019.
The need for money is acute as the candidates enter one of the most intense phases of the primary with consequential contests on each of the next two Saturdays, in Nevada and South Carolina. The latter state will be followed almost immediately by 15 states and territories on the next Tuesday, including the big prizes of California and Texas, where the cost of advertising can be prohibitive.
With the most delegates after the first two contests, Buttigieg, who ended two terms as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, last month, now faces one rival in Michael Bloomberg — the billionaire former New York City mayor who has almost limitless money — and another in Sanders, whose army of small contributors have been giving in accelerating amounts. Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire from California, has been spending heavily and rising in the polls in Nevada and South Carolina.
Buttigieg had entered 2020 with $14.5 million in the bank. But his pace of spending since then burned through much of that sum, and some of his money is earmarked for the general election and cannot be spent in the primary.
His monthly payroll had climbed to $2.7 million by December, federal filings showed. He spent $2.5 million on Facebook and Google ads since Jan. 1, company records show. And Buttigieg invested $6.5 million in television ads from Jan 1. through the New Hampshire primary this past Tuesday, according to Advertising Analytics, a media tracking firm. Plus, there are the other costs to run for president that are only growing — chartered planes, renting event space, polling, consulting fees and more. His campaign reported a single $761,039 credit card payment in December, for instance.
In the final quarter, Buttigieg raised $24.7 million, though he spent far more than that during the three-month period, about $34 million. Other candidates, including Sanders and Warren, similarly spent more than they raised as the primaries neared.
His advisers have previously told donors that they were investing almost everything in Iowa, where he earned the most state delegate equivalents, and New Hampshire, where he finished a strong second, in hopes that command performances in those two states would open up political and financial opportunities beyond.
“All the chips were on the table for Iowa,” said David Jacobson, a Buttigieg fundraiser and former ambassador.
“It was money well spent,” said Robert Mandell, another former ambassador and Buttigieg fundraiser.
But the impact of Buttigieg’s apparent win in Iowa was dampened by the delayed and muddled results that are still subject to a recanvass. His campaign announced he had raised $4 million in the four days afterward. That is a significant sum but still less than what rival strategists said might have otherwise been expected for winning the opening contest.
Sanders was raising money at a clip of well above $1 million per day online in early February, according to an estimate based on figures released by his campaign. And that was before he won the New Hampshire primary. Warren’s campaign told supporters this week she had raised $5 million in the nine days following the Iowa caucuses. Neither senator is holding traditional fundraisers for large donors.
One of Buttigieg’s events will be Feb. 23 at the home of Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va. — the first member of Congress to endorse him — with five other congressional co-hosts. Three days later, he will hold three fundraisers across Florida — which does not hold its primary until March 17 — including one in Palm Beach whose hosts include Cynthia Friedman, a longtime Democratic contributor.
The campaign had sent invitations to even more events, including in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, on Feb. 27 — the $500-level ticket is listed as sold out online for the Atlanta gathering — but Buttigieg aides said those events were being rescheduled.
Buttigieg is not alone on the fundraising circuit. Former Vice President Joe Biden organized a conference call with his national finance committee after his fifth-place New Hampshire finish to reassure skittish donors. He has upcoming fundraisers in Colorado, Nevada and South Carolina, the latter two in states that vote later this month.
On Thursday, Biden held two events in New York that drew a notable group of Wall Street contributors. Organizers said the events raised almost $800,000, a large haul for a candidate who had sagged to fourth and fifth place in the first two contests. Biden also said on “The View” this week that he was raising about $400,000 per day in online donations.
That same evening, Michael Halle, a top strategist for Buttigieg, was in Washington meeting with donors with contribution levels up to $1,000 (other Buttigieg advisers, including Lis Smith and Michael Schmuhl, have previously headlined fundraisers).
Both Biden and Buttigieg have been assisted by super political action committees, which are legally barred from coordinating strategy with the campaigns. Halle drew some criticism for a post on Twitter two days after the Iowa caucuses all but directing where such support could best be used.
The Buttigieg campaign announced expanding its Super Tuesday operations Thursday, saying it would have “boots on the ground” in each of the states as of next Monday. That is far later than Warren and Sanders, who ramped up operations in 2019.
Not all of Buttigieg’s staff in Iowa and New Hampshire are keeping their jobs. The campaign said it was following the terms of the union contract.
“When positions in Iowa ended after the caucuses, we’ve been offering new positions as they become available as directed by the collective bargaining agreement,” said Chris Meagher, Buttigieg’s spokesman. “We’re glad to have already offered the vast majority of them new positions on our team.”

Egan: California exports anti-Trump voters

Texto completo: President Donald Trump clearly hates the most populous state in the country he governs. While trashing California with his gutter mouth, the president has used his office to physically trash the home to nearly 1 in 8 Americans — seeking to make its air more polluted, its water less clean, its forests more vulnerable to catastrophic fires.
But now the Golden State is poised to strike back. By moving its presidential primary from June to March 3, California will finally exert a political influence commensurate to its size. Almost 500 delegates, a fourth of the number needed to win the Democratic nomination, are at stake.
Perhaps more consequential — or at least overlooked — is what’s happening among the vast diaspora of more than 7.3 million people who have left California since 2007. They appear to be changing the political makeup of the states they’ve moved to, perhaps enough to alter the Electoral College map in favor of Democrats.
With nearly 40 million people, California is still gaining population — barely. But stratospheric home prices and unbearable rental costs have created a reverse “Grapes of Wrath,” forcing those who are not rich to flee to states with much lower costs of living.
The question is: Are they bringing California values — fierce defense of the environment, tolerance of immigrants and a multiracial society, insistence on universal health care — with them? It could be just demographic churn. But if you look at the changing politics of Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, all fast-growing states packed with new arrivals from California, the answer is yes. Texas may not be far behind.
The most endangered species, California Republicans, make the most noise about how awful the state is. They cite the many thousands sleeping on streets, the failure to enforce basic standards of public behavior and high taxes. San Francisco, the sad city by the bay, has become a “hostage to the homeless,” as one respected state journal put it.
More than half of Californians say they have considered leaving the state, and a large majority of them are conservatives, as one survey found. But the evidence in the states taking in a majority of ex-Californians — among those who actually leave rather than just whine about leaving — tells another story.
In Nevada, which saw 500,000 Californians move there between 2008 and 2018, Democrats won the governor’s mansion and a second U.S. Senate seat in 2018. There used to be more Republicans, by registration. But Democrats now have a 70,000-voter advantage, and they prevailed there in the last three presidential races.
Colorado, another favorite landing spot for those who can no longer afford California, is now reliably blue. Democrats won majorities there by more than 100,000 votes in the last two presidential elections. The state is likely to flip a Senate seat, bouncing the inept Republican Cory Gardner for a popular former governor, John Hickenlooper.
Arizona could be the next to fall to Democrats. The state known for retirees and tax-averse whites is becoming more diverse and younger and is full of ex-Californians. Between 2001 and 2014, Arizona added about a quarter-million people from its neighboring state to the west.
Trump won Arizona by 91,000 votes. But in 2018, quirky Kyrsten Sinema became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat since 1988, with a victory margin of about 56,000 votes.
Looking at this year’s electoral map, Arizona is a wild card. I’ve long believed that it’s better to win back the 80,000 votes that proved to be the winning margin for Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan than to grow another two million progressives on the coasts.
But if the Dems were to win Arizona’s 11 Electoral College votes, as polls show they could, and lose Wisconsin’s 10, while getting back Pennsylvania and Michigan, that would be enough to remove the vile and corrupt man occupying the White House.
Texas, the top state for California exiles, will probably come up short for Democrats this year, though it’s in play. Democrats have a growing advantage in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, all seeing heavy U-Haul traffic from California.
Polls in Texas show Trump failing to get above 48% in matchups with Democrats. And 45% of voters wanted to impeach and remove him from office.
Bullying and berating California is good politics for Trump. The rest of the country has little sympathy for the “sunbaked barbarians,” as an old friend in Seattle used to call them. As someone who grew up loathing the hordes who moved north to my native Pacific Northwest, I get it.
But Trump treats these fellow citizens as aliens. He’s going out of his way to gut the state’s clean air standards, to turn the Eden of its public lands over to industrial pillagers and to cast its immigrant strivers as criminals. He has done nothing — rebuffing the state’s plea for additional housing vouchers for the poor — to mitigate the homeless crisis. He’d prefer a dystopia on the Pacific, largely because he lost the Golden State by more than 4 million votes.
And yet Californians, those who still proudly call it home and those who left their hearts there, could be the force that sends him packing.

Texto completo: Almost everybody admires the Nordic model. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have high economic productivity, high social equality, high social trust and high levels of personal happiness.
Progressives say it’s because they have generous welfare states. Some libertarians point out that these countries score high on nearly every measure of free market openness. Immigration restrictionists note that until recently they were ethnically homogeneous societies.
But Nordic nations were ethnically homogeneous in 1800 when they were dirt poor. Their economic growth took off just after 1870, way before their welfare states were established. What really launched the Nordic nations was generations of phenomenal educational policy.
The 19th-century Nordic elites did something we haven’t been able to do in this country recently. They realized that if their countries were to prosper they had to create truly successful “folk schools” for the least educated among them. They realized that they were going to have to make lifelong learning a part of the natural fabric of society.
They look at education differently than we do. The German word they used to describe their approach, bildung, doesn’t even have an English equivalent. It means the complete moral, emotional, intellectual and civic transformation of the person. It was based on the idea that if people were going to be able to handle and contribute to an emerging industrial society, they would need more complex inner lives.
Today, Americans often think of schooling as the transmission of specialized skill sets — can the student read, do math, recite the facts of biology. Bildung is devised to change the way students see the world. It is devised to help them understand complex systems and see the relations between things — between self and society, between a community of relationships in a family and a town.
As Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman put it in their book “The Nordic Secret,” “Bildung is the way that the individual matures and takes upon him or herself ever bigger personal responsibility towards family, friends, fellow citizens, society, humanity, our globe and the global heritage of our species, while enjoying ever bigger personal, moral and existential freedoms.”
The Nordic educators worked hard to cultivate each student’s sense of connection to the nation. Before the 19th century, most Europeans identified themselves in local and not national terms. But the Nordic curriculum instilled in students a pride in, say, their Danish history, folklore and heritage.
“That which a person did not burn for in his young days, he will not easily work for as a man,” Christopher Arndt Bruun wrote. The idea was to create in the mind of the student a sense of wider circles of belonging — from family to town to nation — and an eagerness to assume shared responsibility for the whole.
The Nordic educators also worked hard to develop the student’s internal awareness. That is to say, they helped students see the forces always roiling inside the self — the emotions, cravings, wounds and desires. If you could see those forces and their interplay, as if from the outside, you could be their master and not their slave.
Their intuition was that as people grow, they have the ability to go through developmental phases, to see themselves and the world through ever more complex lenses. A young child may blindly obey authority — Mom, Dad, teacher. Then she internalizes and conforms to the norms of the group. Then she learns to create her own norms based on her own values. Then she learns to see herself as a node in a network of selves and thus learns mutuality and holistic thinking.
The purpose of bildung is to help people move through the uncomfortable transitions between each way of seeing.
That educational push seems to have had a lasting influence on the culture. Whether in Stockholm or Minneapolis, Scandinavians have a tendency to joke about the way their sense of responsibility is always nagging at them. They have the lowest rates of corruption in the world. They have a distinctive sense of the relationship between personal freedom and communal responsibility.
High social trust doesn’t just happen. It results when people are spontaneously responsible for one another in the daily interactions of life, when the institutions of society function well.
In the U.S., social trust has been on the decline for decades. If the children of privilege get to go to the best schools, there’s not going to be much social mutuality. If those schools do not instill a love of nation, there’s not going to be much shared responsibility.
If you have a thin educational system that does not help students see the webs of significance between people, does not even help students see how they see, you’re going to wind up with a society in which people can’t see through each other’s lenses.
When you look at the Nordic bildung model, you realize our problem is not only that we don’t train people with the right job skills. It’s that we don’t have the right lifelong development model to instill the mode of consciousness people need to thrive in a complex pluralistic society.

ICE to deploy more in sanctuary cities

Texto completo: In brief
LOS ANGELES - Federal immigration officials confirmed Friday that border agents and officers, including those in tactical units, will be deployed in Los Angeles and other so-called sanctuary cities to assist in the arrests of immigrants in the country illegally.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman confirmed details of the planned deployment that were first reported in the New York Times. The agency referred further questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
CBP will deploy 50 Border Patrol agents and 50 field operations customs officers in nine areas, according to the agency. Specially trained officers will be sent to cities including Chicago and New York, the New York Times reported.
Additional agents are expected to be sent to San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit and Newark, New Jersey, according to the agency. The deployment of the teams will run from February through May.
CBP agents and officers being detailed to help ICE will come from different sectors and job positions, including some trained in tactical operations, according to the agency.
"ICE is utilizing CBP to supplement enforcement activity in response to the resource challenges stemming from sanctuary city policies," ICE Director Matthew Albence said in a statement.
Albence said the action was being taken in response to sanctuary-city law enforcement agencies not cooperating with federal authorities. As a result, the statement continued, federal officers "are forced to make at-large arrests of criminal aliens who have been released into communities."
"This effort requires a significant amount of additional time and resources," Albence said. "When sanctuary cities release these criminals back to the street, it increases the occurrence of preventable crimes, and more importantly, preventable victims."
The number of nondetained cases increased from 2.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to more than 3.2 million in the following fiscal year, according to DHS.
Agents being deployed include those within the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, according to the New York Times report. The unit "provides an immediate response capability to emergent and high-risk incidents requiring specialized skills and tactics," according to the CBP website.
John Sandweg, who headed ICE during the administration of former President Barack Obama, called the latest move by the Trump administration "dangerous."
"You're pulling critical manpower off the border and you're doing it really candidly for a political show of force," Sandweg said.
Sandweg called it a move "to offend so-called sanctuary cities ... by deploying a bunch of Army-looking Border Patrol agents."
Avenatti convicted in extortion case
NEW YORK - Michael Avenatti, a lawyer who gained fame by representing a porn star in lawsuits against President Donald Trump, was convicted Friday of trying to extort sportswear giant Nike.
The verdict was returned by a Manhattan federal jury after it deliberated charges of attempted extortion and honest services fraud in what prosecutors say was an attempt by Avenatti to extort up to $25 million from Nike with threats to otherwise harm it. The charges carry a combined potential penalty of 42 years in prison.
Avenatti, 48, became prominent during frequent cable television program appearances in 2018 and 2019 as journalists courted him for information about porn star Stormy Daniels and her claims of a Trump tryst before he became president and a payoff to remain silent about it.
But a steep fall from power-broker status was swift when Avenatti was arrested as he was about to meet Nike lawyers last March to press his demands for millions of dollars to conduct an internal probe of the Beaverton, Oregon-based shoemaker.
Avenatti maintained he was taking the aggressive position at the urging of his client, Gary Franklin, who ran a youth basketball league in Los Angeles and was angry that Nike ended a decade-long sponsorship that provided $72,000 annually and free gear. He sought $1.5 million for Franklin, as well.
Franklin testified that two Nike executives forced him to pay money to the mother of an elite high school basketball player's mother and to pass along payments to the handlers of other players while doctoring paperwork to hide the purpose of the funds.
Avenatti did not testify, but his lawyers said he was following the wishes of Franklin and an entertainment executive who advised him to be aggressive.
Trump ignores A.G. Barr's plea
WASHINGTON - Unbowed by a public rebuke from his attorney general, President Donald Trump on Friday declared he has the "legal right" to intervene in criminal cases and sidestep the Justice Department's historic independence.
A day after Attorney General William Barr said the president's tweets were making it "impossible" for Barr to do his job, Trump said he had the right to ask the agency to intervene in cases.
While Barr complained the tweets undermine the department's perception as independent, he has proven to be eager to deliver on many of the president's priorities.
The attorney general stepped in this week to alter the sentencing recommendation for Trump ally Roger Stone. Also, Justice Department prosecutors are reviewing the handling of the investigation into Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. And Barr has appointed a U.S. attorney who is conducting an investigation into the origins of the FBI's probe of the 2016 election that morphed into Robert Mueller's investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during its probe of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but his sentencing has been postponed.
As president, Trump has the right to compel the Justice Department, an executive branch agency, to launch investigations. But historically, Justice has functioned independently.
"I'm happy to say that, in fact, the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case," Barr said. "However, to have public statements and tweets made about the department, about our people  about cases pending in the department, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."

US won't charge ex-FBI official McCabe, a Trump target

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors have declined to charge former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, closing an investigation into whether the longtime target of President Donald Trump's ire lied to federal officials about his involvement in a news media disclosure, McCabe's legal team said Friday.

The decision, coming at the end of a tumultuous week between the Justice Department and the White House, is likely to further agitate a president who has loudly complained that federal prosecutors have pursued cases against his allies but not against his perceived political enemies.

The action resolves a criminal investigation that began nearly two years ago with a referral from the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which concluded that McCabe had repeatedly lied about having authorized a subordinate to share information with a newspaper reporter for a 2016 article about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

The case was handled by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which was at the center of a public rift with Justice Department leadership this week over the recommended sentence for Trump ally Roger Stone. Senior Justice Department officials overruled a decision on a recommended prison sentence that they felt was too harsh, prompting the trial team to quit the case. Attorney General William Barr also took a rare public swipe at Trump by saying in a television interview that the president's tweets about the Stone case and other matters were making his job "impossible."

Separately, the Justice Department has begun reviewing the handling of the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

On Friday, prosecutors notified McCabe's attorneys in a phone call and a letter that they were closing the case. The letter, signed by the chief of the office's public corruption unit, did not give a precise reason but said the decision was reached after "careful consideration" and "based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time."

McCabe's lawyers, Michael Bromwich and David Schertler, said they were gratified by the decision.

"At long last, justice has been done in this matter," the lawyers said in a statement. "We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought."

Speaking Friday on CNN, where he works as a contributor, McCabe said it was an "absolute disgrace" that the investigation had taken so long and that he was relieved to be done with a process that he described as "so unbelievably tense."

Though federal prosecutors wrote that they consider the matter closed, Justice Department actions in the last few months have proven unpredictable, with a willingness to scrutinize or revisit decisions that had appeared resolved.

McCabe, a frequent target of Trump's attacks, has denied that he intentionally misled anyone. He has said his 2018 firing -- for what the Justice Department called "lack of candor" -- was politically motivated. He sued the Justice Department in August, saying officials had used the inspector general's conclusions as a pretext to rid the FBI of leaders Trump perceived as biased against him.

The decision is likely to further exacerbate tensions between Trump and Barr, who before speaking out in the television interview had privately complained to aides and the president himself that Trump's comments about the Justice Department were undercutting his political agenda and raising questions about the department's credibility. The White House was not given a heads-up about the decision beforehand, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

The moment came against a backdrop of growing anger from Trump at the Justice Department. The president has seethed that more of his political enemies have not been charged, included former FBI Director James Comey and his associates.

The president was particularly incensed no charges were filed over Comey's handling of memos about his interactions with Trump, a matter that was referred to the Justice Department for potential prosecution, according to a White House official and Republican close to the White House who weren't authorized to speak publicly about private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The president angrily denounced the decision and berated Barr over it, according to the officials. Aides expected that the decision not to charge McCabe could produce a similar eruption of rage. Trump did not address the matter during a media appearance Friday.

Trump has also repeatedly complained about FBI Director Christopher Wray in recent months, saying he has not done enough to rid the bureau of people who are disloyal to Trump.

It was not immediately clear what had prompted a review of the Flynn case, though the person familiar with the matter said U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen of St. Louis was working on it. The New York Times first reported Jensen's involvement.

The decision to spare McCabe criminal charges eliminates the prospect of a sensational trial that would have refocused public attention on the chaotic months of 2016, when the FBI was entangled in presidential politics through investigations touching both main contenders -- Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, her Republican opponent.

The criminal investigation arose from an October 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal that described internal debates roiling the FBI and the Justice Department weeks before the presidential election about how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated. The article recounted a particularly tense phone call between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official.

The inspector general's report said McCabe told internal investigators that he had not authorized anyone at the FBI to speak with the reporter and that he did not know who did. The report said McCabe ultimately corrected that account and confirmed that he had encouraged the conversation with the reporter to counter a narrative that he thought was false.

McCabe has denied any wrongdoing and has said he was distracted by the tumult surrounding the FBI and the White House during the times he was questioned. One of the interviews took place the same day that Comey was fired.

"During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me," McCabe has said in a statement. "And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them."

McCabe has been a target of Trump's attacks since even before he was elected, after news emerged in the fall of 2016 that McCabe's wife had accepted campaign contributions from a political action committee associated with ex-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe during an unsuccessful run for the state Senate there.

Texto completo: Immigration SWAT teams are reportedly being redeployed to New York to beef up enforcement teams in an escalation of President Trump's feud with cities that reject his crackdown on undocumented people.
Heavily armed troops will be moved from the southern border to the city to round up immigrants, despite the officers' lack of experience operating in an urban environment where many residents oppose their presence.
A Customs and Border Patrol spokesman claimed the troops would "enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security."
About 100 members of a tactical unit called BORTAC will be sent to New York and Chicago, both have proclaimed themselves sanctuary cities in which local law enforcement does not cooperate with round ups of immigrants, the New York Times reported Friday.
More agents are expected to be sent to Newark, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans and Detroit. The assignments are expected to stretch into spring, during a time of year when chilly temperatures traditionally limit flows of immigrants coming north from Central America and Mexico.
The BORTAC units usually work raiding safe houses and busting dangerous people-smugglers in the sparsely-populated desert badlands along the border with Mexico.
They will now find themselves backing up Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in chock a block urban neighborhoods where they are often a distrusted presence at best.
Just last week, a bystander was shot in the face and wounded by ICE agents arresting an undocumented immigrant in Brooklyn.

Texto completo: U.S. officials said Friday that they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable.
If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India.
That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president.
But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart.
Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump.
One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan -- though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down.
But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict.
In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place.
The deal calls for a complete American withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban -- something the Taliban has long refused -- on a long-term power-sharing settlement.
Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.

Coronavirus could push Europe into a downturn

Texto completo: So far, only scattered cases of the coronavirus have appeared in Europe, but the economic effects are proving harder to quarantine. The shock may be severe enough to push the vulnerable German economy, and perhaps the entire eurozone, into a recession.
That is the conclusion of a growing number of economists as it becomes clear that it will take weeks, at best, before the Chinese economy resumes its role as a prolific exporter of essential factory goods, and as an increasingly important consumer market for the rest of the world.
"The longer it takes for production to resume, the higher the risks," said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
For the chief executive of Daimler, one of Germany's most prominent companies with several auto plants in China, the crisis is one of uncertainty.
"I'm calling China every day," Ola Källenius said at a news conference in Stuttgart. "It's too early to say if and how other factories could be affected. We are talking about global networks."
The rest of the world could also suffer economically, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, warned lawmakers this week.
"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell told House Financial Services Committee members.
The problems of German automakers' reverberate around the continent, because so many small and midsize parts suppliers in countries depend on them for sales. Italy's economy shrank in the fourth quarter in part because its industrial north is closely linked to Germany.
"For most countries, Germany is the most important trading partner," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. "If it starts to slow down, other countries will feel it."
Daimler and other carmakers were forced to keep their factories in China closed longer than planned after the Lunar New Year holiday, and the virus has kept people out of showrooms. On Monday, the company said it had begun gradually ramping up production.
But the situation remains tense and unpredictable. There is widespread concern that assembly lines around the world could be forced to shut down for lack of components made in China.
China has become a critical market for all German carmakers. Daimler sold nearly 700,000 Mercedes-Benz cars in China last year, more than twice as many as it sold in the United States.
Smaller companies are also affected. Many have factories in China that have been idle or operating far below capacity.
Ziehl-Abegg, a German maker of industrial fans, has a factory in Shanghai with 450 workers who produce air-circulation systems for hospitals, among other things. The high-performance fans have been in demand during the crisis.
Nevertheless, Chinese authorities allowed only a skeleton crew on the site last week to fill orders from newly built hospitals in Wuhan, Shandong and Shenzhen, said Rainer Grill, a Ziehl-Abegg spokesman.
Even after the Shanghai factory was allowed to reopen this week, fewer than half of the employees reported to work. They were under orders to stay home because they had visited affected areas of China during the Lunar New Year.
German machinery-makers like Ziehl-Abegg are coming off a terrible year and can hardly afford any more problems. New orders for products like machine tools or construction machinery slumped 9% in 2019 because of President Donald Trump's trade war, Brexit and auto industry woes.

Orlando kitchen facility planned Idea seems linked to Uber founder's delivery concept

Texto completo: A facility for 41 kitchens planned near Orlando's Camping World Stadium appears linked to the delivery-only ghost kitchen business backed by Uber founder Travis Kalanick.
The kitchens are in the works at 18 N. Dollins Ave. and would generate a "lower parking demand than is typical for similar land uses," Orlando city documents show.
The property, which has a more than 20,000-square-foot building, was sold last year for $1.275 million to 18 N Dollins Ave Orl LLC, Orange County property records show. State records show City Storage Systems LLC is behind that company.
In 2018, Kalanick posted on Twitter he had started a fund that acquired a controlling interest in City Storage Systems.
"Of particular interest are CSS's leading B2B initiatives, CloudKitchens and CloudRetail, focused on real estate acquisition and development for the food and retail services industries," the post read.
Kalanick resigned as Uber CEO in 2017 amid controversy over the company's culture, including sexual harassment and discrimination, according to The New York Times.
Ghost kitchens have no dining rooms and use delivery apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash to serve customers.
Delivery-only restaurants have lower real estate and upfront costs, CloudKitchens' website states. Orlando, along with Miami and Jacksonville, is listed as a region of interest for those who want to connect with the company.
"Our kitchens have been designed to meet the requirements of food and beverage businesses," its website states. "But not every business is the same, so layouts can be adapted to suit the needs of our clients."
Central Florida already has a ghost kitchen in Winter Park's KitchenAF. Orlando-based seafood chain Red Lobster also announced it will be testing a ghost kitchen.
KitchenAF owner Jim Marshall said last year his restaurant paid about $1,500 a month for its space in the Winter Park Commerce Center off Aloma Avenue and had six kitchen staffers.
"We have a tremendous overhead advantage, and a tremendous labor advantage," he said at the time. "We have a bare minimum crew."
Delivery services do carry a cost for restaurants, which were charged about 30% in addition to what customers were charged for delivery when it started, restaurant analyst John Gordon previously said. Large restaurant chains are working to negotiate that cost down.
Ghost kitchens can go in areas where rents aren't as high, but they need to be close to major thoroughfares to grow their delivery radius, according to Miami-based Rafael Romero, senior vice president retail advisory at JLL, a real estate and investment management professional services firm.
The Dollins Avenue kitchen, which is changing from warehouse space, is not far from State Road 408.

Coronavirus: Is China giving us all the facts?

Texto completo: Many experts are saying the virus from Wuhan, China, is turning into a global pandemic, with a mortality rate (based on official statistics) of roughly 2%. By contrast, the mortality rate of the 1918 Spanish Flu was 2.5%. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe, killing more people than World War I.
Will Wuhan be the same? Unclear.
Writing in The New York Times, Frankie Huang, an American in quarantine in Shanghai, reports that the problem is in trusting the official numbers: "Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1% every day since Jan. 30. 'This magical virus is very good at math!' I felt my face crumple as I stared at the numbers. I had forgotten that every piece of news must be examined for how it is being used to strengthen the regime's rule. ... I so badly want to believe in the Chinese government when millions of lives are on the line."
Well, perhaps the Chinese officials are lying, but perhaps they're telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.
Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
The Chinese government continues to censor news and social media. This not only keeps the rest of the world from knowing what's going on, it also makes it harder for the government itself to keep track of what's really happening, as opposed to what underlings are reporting to their superiors.
This is a problem for any organization, to some degree. People reporting to higher-ups generally try to put the best possible spin on things. If the reports go through several layers of management, the end result could wind up pretty far removed from the reality on the ground.
It's a bigger problem in authoritarian or totalitarian countries lacking free speech or a free press. On the one hand, such control over expression helps cement the authorities' position in power. On the other hand, it also serves to keep the authorities ignorant about important developments. If there's no way for information to end run around the various levels of management who report upward, then there's no way for the people at the top to know whether they're being told the truth.
If I were the Chinese leadership, I'd be worried.
Meanwhile, for the rest of us who know even less than the Chinese leadership, the question is just how bad this epidemic/pandemic is likely to get.
China has been ignoring offers of help from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Is that because they don't need the help, or because they have secrets they'd rather keep? For now, there's no way to know.
We can hope that first world sanitation and medical care, two things that China emphatically lacks, will keep things from getting out of control outside China. But it will be a few weeks yet before we'll know for sure just how serious this outbreak is. And the result might even surprise the Chinese.
Even if this turns out to be more of a fizzle than a catastrophe, the Wuhan virus serves as a reminder that the interconnected global economy has downsides as well as upsides, and that our preparation for new disease outbreaks remains inadequate. Let's hope the lessons from this experience will be learned, and that they won't be too expensive.

Rihanna's line accused of deceptive marketing

Texto completo: When singer Rihanna started a lingerie collection in 2018, she teamed up with the startup behind Kate Hudson's athleisure line Fabletics.
But Fabletics and the startup TechStyle Fashion Group faced complaints about deceptive billing tactics, and now Rihanna's line, Savage x Fenty, is now facing the same criticism.
The line has been praised for using models of different body types and ethnicities in its marketing. But on Tuesday, Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization, said Savage x Fenty "ensnares consumers into unwanted monthly charges" through a membership plan that was difficult to opt out of. It said it had alerted the Federal Trade Commission to the line's business practices, which it believes violate the agency's rules and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.
When consumers buy items like bras and underwear from the Savage x Fenty website, the brand allegedly enrolls consumers in $50 monthly subscriptions "without disclosing all the material terms and conditions of the offer," Truth in Advertising said. The prices that appear when an item is added to a shopper's online cart - say, $19.50 for a pair of leggings - require a membership. For nonmembers, the price of the leggings would more than double. Truth in Advertising added that the brand also used "dissuasion and diversion tactics" when consumers tried to cancel memberships.
Savage x Fenty denied the claims. "These accusations are false and based on misconceptions of our business," Emma Tully, a representative for the line, said in an email.
"At Savage x Fenty, we believe strongly in transparency, which is why we provide multiple disclosures of membership terms throughout the shopping experience, within advertisements and through our ambassador engagement policies," she said.
The complaint from Truth in Advertising involves the pervasiveness of so-called negative-option billing online, which refers to the practice of companies charging consumers for a service unless it is specifically declined.
"A lot of consumers really love the fact that this brand is championing female empowerment and inclusiveness, and so they are very willing to purchase products from this website," Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth in Advertising, said. "What they don't understand is that the prices they're seeing on social media are prices for joining a membership, and because of the way the checkout process works, they are unwittingly being put into a subscription model."
When customers add items from the site to a shopping cart, a "Savage x Monthly Membership" is automatically added. To check out, customers have to proactively remove it, which may cause the price of items to rise sharply.
TechStyle has raised more than $500 million in funding and is valued at about $1 billion, according to Pitchbook, a data provider. The startup, formerly known as JustFab, and its founders have specialized in these types of subscriptions for years.

Coronavirus outbreak could push Europe into a downturn

Texto completo: FRANKFURT, Germany - So far, only scattered cases of the coronavirus have appeared in Europe, but the economic effects are proving harder to quarantine. The shock may be severe enough to push the vulnerable German economy, and perhaps the entire eurozone, into a recession.
That is the conclusion of a growing number of economists as it becomes clear that it will take weeks, at best, before the Chinese economy resumes its role as a prolific exporter of essential factory goods, and as an increasingly important consumer market for the rest of the world.
"The longer it takes for production to resume, the higher the risks," said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
For the chief executive of Daimler, one of Germany's most prominent companies with several auto plants in China, the crisis is one of uncertainty.
"I'm calling China every day," Ola Källenius said at a news conference in Stuttgart. "It's too early to say if and how other factories could be affected. We are talking about global networks."
The rest of the world could also suffer economically, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, warned lawmakers this week.
"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell told House Financial Services Committee members.
The problems of German automakers' reverberate around the continent, because so many small and midsize parts suppliers in countries depend on them for sales. Italy's economy shrank in the fourth quarter in part because its industrial north is closely linked to Germany.
"For most countries, Germany is the most important trading partner," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. "If it starts to slow down, other countries will feel it."
Daimler and other carmakers were forced to keep their factories in China closed longer than planned after the Lunar New Year holiday, and the virus has kept people out of showrooms. On Monday, the company said it had begun gradually ramping up production.
But the situation remains tense and unpredictable. There is widespread concern that assembly lines around the world could be forced to shut down for lack of components made in China.
China has become a critical market for all German carmakers. Daimler sold nearly 700,000 Mercedes-Benz cars in China last year, more than twice as many as it sold in the United States.
Smaller companies are also affected. Many have factories in China that have been idle or operating far below capacity.
Ziehl-Abegg, a German maker of industrial fans, has a factory in Shanghai with 450 workers who produce air-circulation systems for hospitals, among other things. The high-performance fans have been in demand during the crisis.
Nevertheless, Chinese authorities allowed only a skeleton crew on the site last week to fill orders from newly built hospitals in Wuhan, Shandong and Shenzhen, said Rainer Grill, a Ziehl-Abegg spokesman.
Even after the Shanghai factory was allowed to reopen this week, fewer than half of the employees reported to work. They were under orders to stay home because they had visited affected areas of China during the Lunar New Year.
German machinery-makers like Ziehl-Abegg are coming off a terrible year and can hardly afford any more problems. New orders for products like machine tools or construction machinery slumped 9% in 2019 because of President Donald Trump's trade war, Brexit and auto industry woes.

Study: Muscle mass key to men's heart health Exercise, active lifestyle beneficial as males get older

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later - or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.

Texto completo: How much muscle you have now could indicate how healthy your heart will be later, according to an interesting new study of muscle mass and cardiovascular disease. The study finds that, for men at least, entering middle age with plenty of muscle lowers the subsequent risk of developing heart disease by as much as 81%, compared with the risks for other men.
These results add to the growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle is essential for healthy aging, while also underscoring that the effects may be different for women and men.
Skeletal muscle is, of course, one of the body's most versatile and active tissues, providing the strength and power we need to grasp, reach, lift and stride. Muscle is also critical for our metabolic health, slurping and storing blood sugar and producing specialized hormones that move to other tissues, like the brain and fat cells, where they jump-start various biochemical processes.
But our muscle mass almost invariably declines as we grow older, with the loss often starting when we are in our 30s or early 40s and accelerating as we pass through midlife. Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is associated with frailty and other medical conditions in the elderly, along with loss of independence and premature death.
But even relatively moderate declines in muscle mass are linked with worse outcomes in older people. Some past studies have found that, particularly in older men, low muscle mass tends often to be associated with concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Those studies, however, did not look at which condition might have come first, and so cannot indicate whether there are links between diminished muscle at one age and heart disease later - or vice versa.
So, for the new study, which was published in the January issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, an international group of scientists interested in muscle health and sarcopenia decided to track people's muscles and heart health as they moved through middle age.
They began by turning to data from the ongoing ATTICA study in Greece, a large-scale look at the underpinnings of cardiovascular disease in a group of Mediterranean men and women. The study, at this point, had enrolled several thousand adults in and around Athens and brought them in to a clinic for extensive medical exams and to fill out lifestyle questionnaires. None of the participants, who ranged in age from early adulthood to retirement age, had cardiovascular disease when they entered the study.
About 10 years after joining the study, each man and woman returned to the lab for another round of testing, focused on their cardiovascular health.
The authors of the new study now zeroed in on the men and women who were at least 45 years old at that second check-in. They wound up with records for 1,019 people, most of them past the age of 55, meaning they had been in their 40s when they joined the study.
Using information from these participants' original medical tests, the scientists calculated each person's overall muscle mass and then looked at whether he or she had developed heart disease by the time of the second clinic visit, about 10 years later.
It turned out that more than a quarter of them had. Almost 27% of the participants, in fact, now had heart disease, with the incidence about six times higher among the men than the women.
And people's muscle mass at the study's start was linked to their chances of heart disease now. Those people with the most muscle then were the least likely to have heart disease now.
That association remained significant when the scientists controlled for people's diet, education and physical activity, but not when they looked at gender. Women's muscle mass was not associated with later risks for heart disease, in large part because so few of the women had developed heart disease. In general, women tend to get heart disease about 10 years later than men.
But for men, having relatively large amounts of muscle early in middle age dropped the risk of heart disease later by 81%, the researchers determined.
"The association was that strong," said Stefanos Tyrovolas, the study's lead author, member of CIBERSAM and principal investigator at the Sant Joan de Deu Research Institute.
This study does not show, though, that having plenty of muscle directly staves off heart disease, only that the two are related. It also cannot tell us just how muscle helps to protect the heart, but Tyrovolas suspects that the metabolic effects of the tissue, which include better blood-sugar control and less bodily inflammation, are likely to contribute.
Well-muscled people also tend to be more active than others, he said, which helps to protect the heart.
But the overall message of the findings, he said, is that "muscle-mass preservation, through physical exercise and an active lifestyle," is probably key to protecting middle-aged hearts, especially for men, and provides another compelling reason to visit the gym or fit in a push-up or 10 today.

Texto completo: MUNICH - U.S. officials said Friday that they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable.
If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India.
That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president.
But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart.
Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump.
One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan - though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down.
But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict.
In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place.
The deal calls for a complete American withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban - something the Taliban has long refused - on a long-term power-sharing settlement.
Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.

Coronavirus outbreak could push Europe into a downturn

Texto completo: FRANKFURT, Germany - So far, only scattered cases of the coronavirus have appeared in Europe, but the economic effects are proving harder to quarantine. The shock may be severe enough to push the vulnerable German economy, and perhaps the entire eurozone, into a recession.
That is the conclusion of a growing number of economists as it becomes clear that it will take weeks, at best, before the Chinese economy resumes its role as a prolific exporter of essential factory goods, and as an increasingly important consumer market for the rest of the world.
"The longer it takes for production to resume, the higher the risks," said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
For the chief executive of Daimler, one of Germany's most prominent companies with several auto plants in China, the crisis is one of uncertainty.
"I'm calling China every day," Ola Källenius said at a news conference in Stuttgart. "It's too early to say if and how other factories could be affected. We are talking about global networks."
The rest of the world could also suffer economically, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, warned lawmakers this week.
"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell told House Financial Services Committee members.
The problems of German automakers' reverberate around the continent, because so many small and midsize parts suppliers in countries depend on them for sales. Italy's economy shrank in the fourth quarter in part because its industrial north is closely linked to Germany.
"For most countries, Germany is the most important trading partner," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. "If it starts to slow down, other countries will feel it."
Daimler and other carmakers were forced to keep their factories in China closed longer than planned after the Lunar New Year holiday, and the virus has kept people out of showrooms. On Monday, the company said it had begun gradually ramping up production.
But the situation remains tense and unpredictable. There is widespread concern that assembly lines around the world could be forced to shut down for lack of components made in China.
China has become a critical market for all German carmakers. Daimler sold nearly 700,000 Mercedes-Benz cars in China last year, more than twice as many as it sold in the United States.
Smaller companies are also affected. Many have factories in China that have been idle or operating far below capacity.
Ziehl-Abegg, a German maker of industrial fans, has a factory in Shanghai with 450 workers who produce air-circulation systems for hospitals, among other things. The high-performance fans have been in demand during the crisis.
Nevertheless, Chinese authorities allowed only a skeleton crew on the site last week to fill orders from newly built hospitals in Wuhan, Shandong and Shenzhen, said Rainer Grill, a Ziehl-Abegg spokesman.
Even after the Shanghai factory was allowed to reopen this week, fewer than half of the employees reported to work. They were under orders to stay home because they had visited affected areas of China during the Lunar New Year.
German machinery-makers like Ziehl-Abegg are coming off a terrible year and can hardly afford any more problems. New orders for products like machine tools or construction machinery slumped 9% in 2019 because of President Donald Trump's trade war, Brexit and auto industry woes.

The notorious Bloomberg and his terroristic pressure campaign National Viewpoint

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Let's state some facts: Michael Ruben Bloomberg notoriously expanded stop-and-frisk in New York City to obscene proportions, violating the bodies and constitutional rights of mostly minority men and boys, and not only defended the policy, but mocked his detractors and bragged about it.
What Bloomberg did as mayor amounted to a police occupation of minority neighborhoods, a terroristic pressure campaign, with little evidence that it was accomplishing the goal of sustained, long-term crime reduction.
Nearly 90% of the people stopped were completely innocent. He knew that. They were the collateral damage in his crusade, black and brown bodies up against walls and down on the ground, groped in the middle of the city by strange men with guns, a vast expanse of human psychological wreckage about which he couldn't care less.
A recording from a speech Bloomberg delivered at the Aspen Institute in 2015 underscores just how callous and cavalier he was in his thinking about this racist policy.
"Ninety-five percent of your murders - murderers and murder victims - fit one MO," Bloomberg said. "You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city."
He goes on to say: "One of the unintended consequences is, people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana, they're all minorities.' Yes, that's true. Why? Because put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is."
Later he says, "The way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them."
So many things to dissect here.
First, Bloomberg didn't see individual criminals, many of whom happened to be minorities; he saw a class of criminals who were minorities. "They are male, minorities, 16 to 25." Many of these were children.
He was articulating an explicitly race-based policy.
Nearly 90% of these young people were completely innocent. They had done absolutely nothing wrong, let alone possess a gun.
The Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan produced a report that became part of a class-action lawsuit against the city in 2010. It found that "the NYPD stop-and-frisk tactics produce rates of seizures of guns or other contraband that are no greater than would be produced simply by chance."
Bloomberg didn't care about any of this. He didn't care about these innocent black and brown bodies. Somewhere in each barrel of good apples there was a bad one, and he was willing to spoil the whole batch to purge that rare bad one.
And yet in the same way that white people in New York City had turned away when Bloomberg was executing his racist policy, many Democrats - including some black ones - appear willing now to turn a blind eye to his past.
They don't recognize that Bloomberg is the master of this sort of emotional manipulation. During his 2001 campaign for mayor, he ran ads that The New York Times noted focused on old crime fears.
"They seem calibrated to throw fear into the hearts of the citizenry at the thought of crime mushrooming again in a post-Giuliani New York City," The Times reported.
During a campaign debate that year, Bloomberg, a Republican at the time, was asked how prevalent he believed racial profiling was in the New York Police Department. His answer is fascinating to examine in retrospect. He said: "In terms of the actuality, it is probably a very small number of police officers. Most police officers in this city work very hard. They are not racist thugs."
No amount of Democrats' anti-Trump fear and panic will ever erase what Bloomberg did. Democrats have a field of fascinating candidates. Many have some crime and justice issues of their own, but nothing approaching the scale of Bloomberg's racist policy.
If Democrats cast aside all of these candidates in favor of Bloomberg and his wealth, I fear they will be making it harder to defeat Trump in November.

But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable.
If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India.
That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president.
But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart.
Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump.
One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan - though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down.
But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict.
In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place.
The deal calls for a complete American withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban - something the Taliban has long refused - on a long-term power-sharing settlement.
Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.

Texto completo: The coronavirus outbreak sweeping across China, and now threatening dozens of other countries, including the United States, is not just a natural disaster. It is the deadly consequence of the Chinese Communist Party's malfeasance and misrule. And, as has been the case for so much of the CCP's seven-decade hegemony, the cruel irony is that the people of China are its main victims.
More than 42,000 Chinese people have been diagnosed with coronavirus since the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan in December – many times the number who contracted SARS in 2002-03 worldwide.
More than 1,000 people have died, and nearly 60 million people are in lockdown. In Wuhan and surrounding areas, undersupplied doctors are wearing rain jackets for want of biohazard gear, citizens fear imminent food shortages and local crematoria are working around the clock to dispose of bodies.
It did not have to be this way. As The New York Times reported, the first case of coronavirus appeared in early December. But Chinese officials did not act for more than a month. When a Wuhan doctor, Li Wenliang, tried to warn his medical school classmates that an unfamiliar illness was ravaging Wuhan Central Hospital, he and his classmates were silenced by local authorities, who threatened to punish anyone "spreading rumors" and "disrupting social order."
By the time authorities finally acknowledged what was happening, a full blown epidemic was underway. "At critical turning points," wrote The Times, "Chinese authorities put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis."
In an additional tragic turn: Dr. Li contracted coronavirus while treating patients. The ophthalmologist died last Friday at the age of 34.
Dr. Li's courage and commitment to human life made him a hero to the Chinese people and an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party.
Secrecy, denial, and coercion are not bugs in Xi Jinping's regime. They are core features. The CCP, concerned first and foremost in its own survival, has had to renegotiate a fragile social contract in recent years, staking its continued right to rule on ensuring that the lives of Chinese citizens are safe, healthy and prosperous.
Xi, the party overlords in Beijing and their apparatchiks in China's provincial and municipal governments have promised that the Chinese government can be "clean," or free of corruption. They promised to be "adaptive" to crises and changing societywide conditions. They promised to be "responsive" to the demands of the citizenry, especially China's rapidly expanding professional class – its millions of attorneys, journalists, scientists, doctors and more, who are increasingly part of a global exchange, and whose demands for efficient social services (good schools, reliable clinics, etc.) resemble the demands of the Western upper-middle class.
What has happened instead? Literal plagues have laid waste to the population. Toxic environmental conditions prevail across the country, especially in China's major cities, where air pollution is so bad that it obscures sunlight.
The government's efforts to silence increasingly vocal political dissidents and religious minorities have exposed a cross-country network of internment camps, a government-sponsored slave labor industry and a horrifying black market in organ harvesting that serves wealthy party members and their family and friends.
And the government's attacks on Hong Kong's semiautonomous status have spurred prolonged, intense protests that have startled party leadership.
These episodes, and others that have flown under the radar of international news media, have brought sharply into question whether the Chinese system, as it is constituted, can really be "clean," "adaptive" and "responsive." And rightly so.
When "east, west, south, north and center, the party leads everything," as the CCP declared in 2017, it cannot simply slough off responsibility for fatal mistakes and grave mismanagement. But it also can't cop to its failures. If the tyrants in Beijing acknowledge their mistakes, they chip away at their own right to rule. Inevitably, their response is to sweep problems under the rug and demand even greater control over the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese citizens – evermore invasive surveillance, evermore complete submission to CCP ideological propaganda. This is a risky game.
There is a better way, of course. Real transparency and democratic accountability help to prevent these sorts of nightmares. Truly clean, adaptive and responsive government is most likely where information can flow freely, where governments are honest and where the people can hold their leaders responsible – and replace them with genuine alternatives. A system that prioritizes and protects the dignity of its citizens, rather than the perpetuation of its ruling cabal, is the only one where real civic health is possible.
Communism is the perfect incubator for the coronavirus. China's predatory system preys on its own people. Trials become tragedies, crises become catastrophes, and the bosses in Beijing exploit their own failures as cover for new and worse abuses.
America and her allies should be clear about what is happening. China's people are sick because the Chinese system is.

Gen Z shoppers want cheap and cute

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," Andrea Vargas says.

Texto completo: Almost everybody admires the Nordic model. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have high economic productivity, high social equality, high social trust and high levels of personal happiness.
Progressives say it's because they have generous welfare states. Some libertarians point out that these countries score high on nearly every measure of free market openness. Immigration restrictionists note that until recently they were ethnically homogeneous societies.
But Nordic nations were ethnically homogeneous in 1800 when they were dirt poor. Their economic growth took off just after 1870, way before their welfare states were established. What really launched the Nordic nations was generations of phenomenal educational policy.
The 19th-century Nordic elites did something we haven't been able to do in this country recently. They realized that if their countries were to prosper they had to create truly successful "folk schools" for the least educated among them. They realized that they were going to have to make lifelong learning a part of the natural fabric of society.
They look at education differently than we do. The German word they used to describe their approach, bildung, doesn't even have an English equivalent. It means the complete moral, emotional, intellectual and civic transformation of the person. It was based on the idea that if people were going to be able to handle and contribute to an emerging industrial society, they would need more complex inner lives.
Today, Americans often think of schooling as the transmission of specialized skill sets - can the student read, do math, recite the facts of biology. Bildung is devised to change the way students see the world. It is devised to help them understand complex systems and see the relations between things - between self and society, between a community of relationships in a family and a town.
As Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman put it in their book "The Nordic Secret," "Bildung is the way that the individual matures and takes upon him or herself ever bigger personal responsibility towards family, friends, fellow citizens, society, humanity, our globe and the global heritage of our species, while enjoying ever bigger personal, moral and existential freedoms."
The Nordic educators worked hard to cultivate each student's sense of connection to the nation. Before the 19th century, most Europeans identified themselves in local and not national terms. But the Nordic curriculum instilled in students a pride in, say, their Danish history, folklore and heritage.
"That which a person did not burn for in his young days, he will not easily work for as a man," Christopher Arndt Bruun wrote. The idea was to create in the mind of the student a sense of wider circles of belonging - from family to town to nation - and an eagerness to assume shared responsibility for the whole.
The Nordic educators also worked hard to develop the student's internal awareness. That is to say, they helped students see the forces always roiling inside the self - the emotions, cravings, wounds and desires. If you could see those forces and their interplay, as if from the outside, you could be their master and not their slave.
Their intuition was that as people grow, they have the ability to go through developmental phases, to see themselves and the world through ever more complex lenses. A young child may blindly obey authority - Mom, Dad, teacher. Then she internalizes and conforms to the norms of the group. Then she learns to create her own norms based on her own values. Then she learns to see herself as a node in a network of selves and thus learns mutuality and holistic thinking.
The purpose of bildung is to help people move through the uncomfortable transitions between each way of seeing.
That educational push seems to have had a lasting influence on the culture. Whether in Stockholm or Minneapolis, Scandinavians have a tendency to joke about the way their sense of responsibility is always nagging at them. They have the lowest rates of corruption in the world. They have a distinctive sense of the relationship between personal freedom and communal responsibility.
High social trust doesn't just happen. It results when people are spontaneously responsible for one another in the daily interactions of life, when the institutions of society function well.
In the U.S., social trust has been on the decline for decades. If the children of privilege get to go to the best schools, there's not going to be much social mutuality. If those schools do not instill a love of nation, there's not going to be much shared responsibility.
If you have a thin educational system that does not help students see the webs of significance between people, does not even help students see how they see, you're going to wind up with a society in which people can't see through each other's lenses.
When you look at the Nordic bildung model, you realize our problem is not only that we don't train people with the right job skills. It's that we don't have the right lifelong development model to instill the mode of consciousness people need to thrive in a complex pluralistic society.

Texto completo: MUNICH - U.S. officials said on Friday they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable. If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India. That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met on Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president. But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart. Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is highly specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump. One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan - though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down. But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict. In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place. It calls for a complete withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban - something the Taliban has long refused - on a long-term power-sharing settlement. Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.
In September, American and Taliban negotiators were close to an agreement, and Trump planned to meet Taliban leaders in person, before he dropped the deal because of a Taliban attack.

Rihanna's line accused of deceptive marketing

Texto completo: When singer Rihanna started a lingerie collection in 2018, she teamed up with the startup behind Kate Hudson's athleisure line Fabletics.
But Fabletics and the startup TechStyle Fashion Group faced complaints about deceptive billing tactics, and now Rihanna's line, Savage x Fenty, is now facing the same criticism.
The line has been praised for using models of different body types and ethnicities in its marketing. But on Tuesday, Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization, said Savage x Fenty "ensnares consumers into unwanted monthly charges" through a membership plan that was difficult to opt out of. It said it had alerted the Federal Trade Commission to the line's business practices, which it believes violate the agency's rules and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.
When consumers buy items like bras and underwear from the Savage x Fenty website, the brand allegedly enrolls consumers in $50 monthly subscriptions "without disclosing all the material terms and conditions of the offer," Truth in Advertising said. The prices that appear when an item is added to a shopper's online cart - say, $19.50 for a pair of leggings - require a membership. For nonmembers, the price of the leggings would more than double. Truth in Advertising added that the brand also used "dissuasion and diversion tactics" when consumers tried to cancel memberships.
Savage x Fenty denied the claims. "These accusations are false and based on misconceptions of our business," Emma Tully, a representative for the line, said in an email.
"At Savage x Fenty, we believe strongly in transparency, which is why we provide multiple disclosures of membership terms throughout the shopping experience, within advertisements and through our ambassador engagement policies," she said.
The complaint from Truth in Advertising involves the pervasiveness of so-called negative-option billing online, which refers to the practice of companies charging consumers for a service unless it is specifically declined.
"A lot of consumers really love the fact that this brand is championing female empowerment and inclusiveness, and so they are very willing to purchase products from this website," Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth in Advertising, said. "What they don't understand is that the prices they're seeing on social media are prices for joining a membership, and because of the way the checkout process works, they are unwittingly being put into a subscription model."
When customers add items from the site to a shopping cart, a "Savage x Monthly Membership" is automatically added. To check out, customers have to proactively remove it, which may cause the price of items to rise sharply.
TechStyle has raised more than $500 million in funding and is valued at about $1 billion, according to Pitchbook, a data provider. The startup, formerly known as JustFab, and its founders have specialized in these types of subscriptions for years.

Coronavirus outbreak could push Europe into a downturn

Texto completo: FRANKFURT, Germany - So far, only scattered cases of the coronavirus have appeared in Europe, but the economic effects are proving harder to quarantine. The shock may be severe enough to push the vulnerable German economy, and perhaps the entire eurozone, into a recession.
That is the conclusion of a growing number of economists as it becomes clear that it will take weeks, at best, before the Chinese economy resumes its role as a prolific exporter of essential factory goods, and as an increasingly important consumer market for the rest of the world.
"The longer it takes for production to resume, the higher the risks," said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
For the chief executive of Daimler, one of Germany's most prominent companies with several auto plants in China, the crisis is one of uncertainty.
"I'm calling China every day," Ola Källenius said at a news conference in Stuttgart. "It's too early to say if and how other factories could be affected. We are talking about global networks."
The rest of the world could also suffer economically, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, warned lawmakers this week.
"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell told House Financial Services Committee members.
The problems of German automakers' reverberate around the continent, because so many small and midsize parts suppliers in countries depend on them for sales. Italy's economy shrank in the fourth quarter in part because its industrial north is closely linked to Germany.
"For most countries, Germany is the most important trading partner," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. "If it starts to slow down, other countries will feel it."
Daimler and other carmakers were forced to keep their factories in China closed longer than planned after the Lunar New Year holiday, and the virus has kept people out of showrooms. On Monday, the company said it had begun gradually ramping up production.
But the situation remains tense and unpredictable. There is widespread concern that assembly lines around the world could be forced to shut down for lack of components made in China.
China has become a critical market for all German carmakers. Daimler sold nearly 700,000 Mercedes-Benz cars in China last year, more than twice as many as it sold in the United States.
Smaller companies are also affected. Many have factories in China that have been idle or operating far below capacity.
Ziehl-Abegg, a German maker of industrial fans, has a factory in Shanghai with 450 workers who produce air-circulation systems for hospitals, among other things. The high-performance fans have been in demand during the crisis.
Nevertheless, Chinese authorities allowed only a skeleton crew on the site last week to fill orders from newly built hospitals in Wuhan, Shandong and Shenzhen, said Rainer Grill, a Ziehl-Abegg spokesman.
Even after the Shanghai factory was allowed to reopen this week, fewer than half of the employees reported to work. They were under orders to stay home because they had visited affected areas of China during the Lunar New Year.
German machinery-makers like Ziehl-Abegg are coming off a terrible year and can hardly afford any more problems. New orders for products like machine tools or construction machinery slumped 9% in 2019 because of President Donald Trump's trade war, Brexit and auto industry woes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is deploying 100 officers and agents from the southern border to sanctuary cities in the U.S. to assist in arrest operations targeting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, according to two people familiar with the plan.
The operation is the latest move in the administration's feud with cities and states that have adopted policies limiting law-enforcement cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to share information about immigrants in custody or detaining them at the request of federal immigration officers.
The personnel are being sent by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, to assist ICE officers in cities including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, these people said. Operations will also take place in Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, Houston, Newark, N.J., and Detroit, these people said.
In a statement, acting ICE Director Matthew Albence said the refusal by the 10 cities to cooperate with deportation officers has spread ICE's resources thin.
"ICE is utilizing CBP to supplement enforcement activity in response to the resource challenges stemming from sanctuary city policies," he said.
The people familiar with the plan didn't provide details on how many officers or agents would be sent to each location or when. The deployment is planned to last from February through May, one of the people said. The planned operation was first reported by the New York Times.
President Trump has long criticized sanctuary jurisdictions, saying they protect criminals who should be deported and endanger Americans. The issue is popular with his supporters, and he cites it frequently on the campaign trail.
Sanctuary jurisdictions argue that the administration's policies are discriminatory, and that cooperation with ICE would discourage immigrants from cooperating with local police. The dispute has escalated in recent weeks.
The Department of Homeland Security last week barred New Yorkers from enrolling in expedited-traveler programs, including Global Entry, after the state last year passed a law allowing illegal immigrants to apply for driver's licenses and shielding state driver's license records from federal immigration officials.
New York state responded Monday by filing a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the decision was unconstitutional. Mr. Trump, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo met on Thursday to discuss the matter.
The Justice Department has also filed lawsuits against New Jersey, California and a Washington state county whose policies all, in different ways, curtailed cooperation with ICE.
Deploying the tactical unit to cities in the interior of the U.S. will leave fewer specially trained agents along the border during what the Trump administration last year declared a "national emergency." The White House extended that state of emergency declaration for another year after it was set to expire Saturday.
ICE's arrest efforts have been stymied in recent years by uncooperative police agencies and immigrant-advocate efforts to inform people about their rights in such situations.

Texto completo: If one news outlet had the manpower and mind-set to dig cynically into the many ways Mike Bloomberg is spending his money to become president, it would be Bloomberg News -- if it weren't owned by Mike Bloomberg.
Bloomberg News has always been a follow-the-money kind of news organization. It never needed a common-man theme to justify it. Mr. Bloomberg's giant spending isn't just buying ads, it's driving up ad rates to make it harder for other Democratic candidates to get their messages out, it's buying up campaign talent so they can't, it's corralling Democratic Party influentials to endorse his candidacy or at least mute any noisy criticism of his effort.
When a recording leaked of Mr. Bloomberg defending stop-and-frisk in New York, Andre Fields of the liberal voting-rights group Fair Fight Action rushed out a tweet hitting him as a "true terrorist" but promptly deleted it. Fair Fight Action had received $5 million in funding from Mr. Bloomberg. Three members of the Congressional Black Caucus helped out with timely endorsements of a man who spent at least $90 million on House Democratic races in the last 19 months.
New York Times columnist Tom Friedman on Wednesday joined in with 1,500 words implying that other Democratic candidates should make way for Mr. Bloomberg. He ended his piece with a disclosure that his wife's charity was supported with Bloomberg donations.
Mr. Bloomberg has said he will spend $1 billion through Election Day. If so, he will have to curb his outlays to meet his target. At $344 million, he's already spent more on advertising than the Clinton and Trump campaigns did in all of 2016.
I wouldn't put it the way his left-wing critics do -- that he's trying to buy the nomination or the presidency. He's trying to buy the Democratic Party elite. He's distorting the incentives of activists, officials and campaign fixers who suddenly are thinking less about a presidential victory and more about the Bloomberg gravy train.
He entered the race, remember, because Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were too left-wing to beat Donald Trump, but he only strengthens Mr. Sanders by giving him a foil for his message of billionaire corruption of politics. Mr. Bloomberg's dominance of the airwaves will not help things shake out in the centrist lane. A tiny fraction of his current spending might be intelligently employed to give Amy Klobuchar a boost. Instead, he's in danger of becoming a pro-Sanders spoiler.
Mr. Bloomberg would make a competent president but the question is moot. Mr. Trump's voters aren't going to abandon him. The Democratic left would see Mr. Bloomberg as a repudiation of everything it hoped to achieve in 2020. Mr. Bloomberg's belief that there's an anti-Trump majority just waiting to coalesce around his earnest self is a variation on the miscalculation that has so many Democrats thinking this is the year for Medicare for All. Democrats have consistently overestimated what Mr. Trump's "unpopularity" can deliver them in 2020. Mr. Bloomberg is making the same mistake.
His ads might have moved him from 3% to 10% in the polls but ads have sharply diminishing returns. They make people aware of a product. They don't make them buy it. After three viewings, viewers tune them out. Mr. Bloomberg could try handing $10 bills to voters but U.S. law and tradition frown on this. It's the other element of his spending, meanwhile, that has toxic potential for the Democratic Party -- the sight of so many party stalwarts dropping everything for a financial opportunity for themselves.
The idea that Mr. Bloomberg has any catch-fire potential in the larger electorate is the ultimate flaw in the scenario. At least if they lose with Bernie, Democrats will be able to respect themselves in the morning.
The potted story line is that Mr. Trump envied Mr. Bloomberg his genuine entrepreneurial accomplishments and his bigger fortune, but it turned out it was Mr. Trump who got up and did what Mr. Bloomberg has been mooning about for two decades -- run for president and win.
Mr. Bloomberg is the man who wants to be invited, who wants to be seen stepping forward because the people summoned him. Mr. Trump invited himself -- and was surprised by the result. His imitators shouldn't kid themselves about this. A genuinely enthusiastic section of the electorate ran away with the GOP in 2016. Mr. Trump provided the message; in no sense was its reception orchestrated by him. On the contrary, he didn't have to spend money on ads.
If Mr. Bloomberg can run away with the Democratic Party in 2020, it will be for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Trump's was a revolution of the grass roots. Mr. Bloomberg's would be a revolution of a paid-off elite.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders's victory in New Hampshire on top of his tie in Iowa makes him a favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Hard to believe, but in a winnable race against President Trump the opposition may nominate a socialist who wants the government to control energy production and health care, who wants nationwide rent control, and who calls America a "racist society from top to bottom." No wonder Democrats like James Carville are in agony.
The Vermont revolutionary's victory portends a long primary battle, unless Democratic voters elevate a single mainstream candidate who can challenge him. Mr. Sanders will get his 25% to 30% primary after primary, racking up delegates on his way to the convention. If other candidates keep dividing the other votes, he will be hard to stop, as Mr. Trump was for Republicans in 2016. Even if a single alternative emerges, Mr. Sanders won't go down without a ferocious intra-party fight.
---
How did this happen? How did Mr. Sanders move from the socialist fringe to the brink of controlling the Democratic Party? The Senator's dogged persistence across decades and especially the last four years is part of the explanation.
Yet Mr. Sanders wouldn't be this close to the White House if not for the complicity of Democrats and the liberals who dominate the academy and media. Rather than fighting the ideas that animate him and his millennial voters, they have indulged and promoted them. They created the political environment in which he could prosper. Consider the intellectual currents he is riding:
-- The attack on capitalism and markets. Like Tony Blair in Britain, Bill Clinton's New Democrats accommodated the economic lessons of Ronald Reagan. By the Obama Presidency, all that had changed. The left blamed markets for the 2008 panic and crash -- not failed government regulation, subsidies for bad housing risks, or too loose monetary policy.
Then came the socialist intellectual comeback led by French economists Thomas Piketty ("Capital"), Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Inequality replaced growth as the top economic policy concern. The economists resurrected the anti-market ideas and tax policies of the 1930s, and they were celebrated by the Democratic press. Occupy Wall Street became the street version of this movement and was praised by no less than Barack Obama.
It's a short ideological hop from there to 60% marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, the demonization of billionaires, and equating business success with "corruption," as Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren do. Millennials heard Democrats assail "the rich" for years, but Bernie has the courage of their pretensions.
-- The rise of left-wing intolerance on campus. From the late 1960s on, the political left flooded into the academy and rewrote the curriculum to fit its ideological fashions. American history was dogmatized, often according to the work of Howard Zinn. The Western canon was purged. Conservatives resisted but lost as liberals accommodated the revolution.
First the humanities, then the social sciences and now even the sciences have been forced to bend to identity politics. Race, gender, class and sexual orientation became preoccupations in scholarship and tenure. This is the academic culture that nurtured millennials and Gen Z to believe in microaggressions and the "cancel culture" that now torments Democrats who disagree.
-- The critique of America as irredeemably racist. Identity politics took an especially sharp turn on race with the police shootings of 2014 and 2015. Black Lives Matter erupted and demanded that politicians bow to its concerns. No Democrat has dared to challenge it, or to defend 50 years of racial progress or the reduction in crime that has saved black lives.
Author Ta-Nehisi Coates became the darling of white liberals with his castigation of America as systemically racist. The New York Times has tried to replace 1776 with the 1619 arrival of the first slaves to North America as a racist America's founding event.
-- Climate change as religion, not science. A generation of apocalyptic climate education has made what was a matter of temperatures and scientific modeling into a cultural identity. No dissent is tolerated, and the solutions must be radical and immediate. Mr. Sanders was quick to sense the political possibility and grab onto the Green New Deal.
---
These are among the beliefs feeding the radicalism and resentment of the Sanders campaign. Bernie started his political career as a Marxist focusing on the economic class struggle. But he has adapted to these other intellectual streams, and this year he has adopted identity politics with a fervor that out-woked Julian Castro and Kamala Harris.
Yet rather than challenge Mr. Sanders, the other candidates have given him a pass on everything besides Medicare for All. They have adopted his tax and redistribution arguments, if not all his policies. They mimic his denunciations of America as racist.
With the exception of Joe Biden, they have also accepted his anti-interventionist foreign policy. The press corps has almost seemed to cheer Mr. Biden's collapse in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet now the Democratic media find themselves fearing that Mr. Sanders might win the nomination and lose to Mr. Trump. Their refusal to challenge the political left makes them Bernie's accomplices.
The tragedy is that this year, even more than most years, the country needs a sensible and centrist opposition party and nominee. Millions of Americans like the results of Mr. Trump's policies but not his divisive brand of politics and personal behavior. They are looking for an alternative who doesn't scare them. The agony of the Democrats is that years of bowing to the left means they may nominate someone who makes Mr. Trump look like the safer choice.

THE MEDIA FALLS IN LOVE WITH ANYBODY BUT BERNIE THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER IS WINNING BUT SOMEHOW HE'S NEVER THE TRIUMPHANT STORY

Texto completo: As the presidential campaign got underway last year, we watched the media lavish its affections on Beto O'Rourke for a while, and then Kamala Harris, briefly, and Elizabeth Warren for perhaps a month.
But, as it will, love waned.
Joe Biden became the new sure thing - experienced, solid and empathetic. Most of all, he possessed that ineffable quality: electability. But after the Iowa caucuses, the attention shifted squarely to Pete Buttigieg, portrayed as a centrist savior, though it's still debatable if he actually won.
Then Tuesday night, the news media's roving crush moved to Amy Klobuchar. Her third-place finish in the New Hampshire Democratic primary became the story of the night.
Never, though, has mainstream media turned its loving eyes to the front-runner, Bernie Sanders. Quite the opposite.
"He is a grumpy, angry person on the stump and he is not going to be elected," raved Republican strategist Sara Fagen on ABC News one recent Sunday morning.
At The New York Times, columnist Thomas Friedman scoffed at the Sanders surge to write in praise of former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is on the verge of being the next flavor du jour, if his record on criminal justice doesn't catch up with him.
On a sentence-by-sentence basis, straight news coverage may not have reflected an anti-Sanders bias, but the framing of that coverage - choices made on headlines and emphasis - sometimes did. (Mr. Sanders, in a home page headline in The Times, "tightens grip" on the party's liberal wing, which sounds more threatening than victorious.)
Meanwhile, Ms. Klobuchar was queen for a day, garnering headlines like this one from Yahoo News: "Riding Wave of Momentum, Klobuchar Lands in 3rd Place in New Hampshire Primary." You heard words like "Klobucharge" and "Klomentum" bandied about.
On MSNBC Tuesday night, host Chris Matthews fawned: "Bernie indicts. She finds a way to care."
Amy Goodman of the progressive news program Democracy Now, a Sanders defender, recalled hearing one cable pundit say that Mr. Sanders had "flatlined at No. 1." On a recent episode she bemoaned that most of the media coverage is "so anti-Bernie it's just remarkable."
The subtext behind much of the disdain is partly a deep-seated sentiment that Mr. Sanders, if nominated, has little chance of winning the general election. But it's also partly - and more insidiously - that many journalists don't identify easily with Mr. Sanders in the same way they do with, say, Ms. Warren or Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Buttigieg.
In Iowa early this month, I asked one local reporter who had met all the major candidates who would be the strongest Democratic candidate. "I don't have a hope, I have a fear," came the answer. It wasn't hard to figure out what that meant or how that sort of visceral dislike might make its way, subtly, into coverage.
While many reporters and pundits have seemed, until very recently, to casually discount Mr. Sanders, a few opinion writers are taking him very seriously - seriously enough to shoot off flares about what a bad choice they think he would make.
"Bernie Can't Win," opined David Frum in The Atlantic, characterizing Mr. Sanders in unflattering terms as "a Marxist of the old school of dialectical materialism, from the land that time forgot." At The Washington Post, columnist Jennifer Rubin has been equally tough; one recent headline: "Bernie Sanders' Trump-like campaign is a disaster for Democrats."
In turn, Mr. Sanders keeps dissing what he calls the corporate media, as he has for years.
In the official editorial-board interview with The New York Times recently, Mr. Sanders blustered that he doesn't cozy up to powerful media figures as other candidates are wont to do.
"I'm not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I'm not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you'll love me and you'll write nice things about me," he said.
A few media figures are giving him his due, if a little grudgingly. CNN's Jake Tapper was one: "Take a step back. He is 78 years old, he is a Democratic socialist, he is a Jewish American, originally from Brooklyn - it is a stunning achievement by Sen. Sanders and for his movement."
Mr. Sanders, though, doesn't seem to mind. His ardent followers bond with him and with each other by despising the mainstream media, often enough with good reason.
And it may well be that he doesn't need or want the help of cable pundits, columnists and other opinion-makers.
From Beto to Biden, their crushes, so far, have turned into heartbreaks.
Maybe media love - fickle and fleeting - is a valentine that Bernie Sanders would rather do without.
Margaret Sullivan is a columnist for The Washington Post.

Lingerie business shifts to something more fitting

Texto completo: On a recent day off from school, teenagers Ellie Sung and Isabella Mas were wandering the Copley Place mall. As she paused for a break, Sung took out her phone and began searching for bras online — ignoring the Victoria's Secret store a few feet away.
Sung, 15, is just not a fan of the brand, which she said doesn't reflect her values. “I know they're transphobic and not inclusive," she said, echoing a prevailing criticism of the retail giant. “If young girls are shopping, they need to see every body type."
Young women like Sung have helped upend Victoria's Secret's status as the lingerie industry's juggernaut. The company once synonymous with sexy is now seen by many as passé, out of step with what modern women seem to want: comfortable bras and underwear that fit properly on a range of body types. Its parent company, L Brands, has seen its stock sag 75 percent since 2015 as it's faced a litany of troubles, including investigations into chief executive Lex Wexner's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and a scathing report this month from The New York Times alleging its executives created a “culture of misogyny, bullying, and harassment." According to CNBC, a possible sale of the company could happen soon.
The chaos at Victoria's Secret has been a boon for new entrants into the $11.9 billion intimate apparel category, and local retailers and lingerie designers are now eager to steal their share of the underwear drawer.
Lisa Mullan, who in a previous life helped usher HubSpot through its IPO, got her start making “beautiful, functional" silk undies because she didn't want to choose between style and comfort. The cofounder of Uwila Warrior now sells her underwear on Neiman Marcus and Free People websites and in her store on Charles Street in Beacon Hill.
“I have young kids and I'm working," she said. “I don't need underwear that is giving me a wedgie."
Local lingerie purveyors say they are seeing a lift in part thanks to the blitz of Instagram ads from direct-to-consumer brands like ThirdLove, Lively, and Cuup that use algorithms, quizzes, and “fit therapists" to help women find their perfect size. They also point to the messaging of brands like American Eagle's Aerie and Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, which feature full-figured women on full display.
Meredith Amenkhienan and Rachel Wentworth, owners of the Forty Winks boutique in Harvard Square, will celebrate a decade in the lingerie business in April, and say they had their strongest year in 2019. The “better fit" messaging that ThirdLove promotes is actually driving shoppers into their store. You can't get one-on-one fittings when you're getting a bra in the mail, Amenkhienan joked.
“It's good for the industry, it's pushing a lot of people to rethink what lingerie means," she said. “But we have had customers who come in who tried ThirdLove and it didn't work for them. They want to come in and touch and feel. It's helping us."
Now in her 40s, Lauren Beitelspacher, a marketing professor at Babson College, said she used to be the target audience for Victoria's Secret. “But I've gotten older, and it hasn't gotten older with me," she said. “I don't want to shop there anymore, and the younger generation doesn't want to shop there because they don't want the things that it stands for."
The prospect of receiving a frilly, lacy little number for Valentine's Day doesn't jibe with the current cultural climate, Beitelspacher said. Customers are less concerned with the male gaze, she said, and are instead responding to marketing messages promoting self-love and empowerment.
“I don't see it as being a gift that people want to give anymore," she said. “My husband is not going to buy that for me, I want to buy it myself."
Victoria's Secret just “didn't change with the times," said James West, who's worked as a Boston-based lingerie salesman since the '80s and now represents several European brands. Other lingerie brands like Chantelle and Cosabella have proven more nimble, and are increasingly pushing T-shirt bras, wireless bralettes, and larger cup sizes.
“Most of the US brands used to go to a triple D — most of them now are going G and H cups," he said. “Women want to be comfortable."
Younger shoppers are seeking out American Eagle's Aerie line for bras, panties, and sleepwear. The company's #AerieREAL campaign ads feature a full spectrum of body types and use unaltered photos of models like athlete Aly Raisman and actress Busy Philipps.
Noelle Scarlett, 24, who works as an associate at Wayfair, said she's been shopping at Aerie since she was a teen. Their ads “have really authentic, beautiful women of all different shapes and sizes," she said, and their garments are both cute and comfortable.
“I don't want things that are wedged up there," she joked.
When she thinks of Victoria's Secret, said Scarlett, it's all “thin bombshell models with angel wings." Even if they are taking steps to be more inclusive, she said, “they don't showcase it."
L Brands has tried to broaden Victoria's Secret's appeal, hiring transgender and plus-size models and adding two additional women to the parent company's board, which until recently was dominated by white men with a median age of 71. In November, the company canceled its televised fashion show, saying it was rethinking the format. The company's board of directors said in a statement that it's made “significant strides" in recent years in providing “a safe, welcoming, and empowering workplace" for its employees and remains “fully committed to continuous improvement and complete accountability."
In the meantime, upstarts are rushing into the breach. Masha Titova broke into the bra business after working in apparel manufacturing for Los Angeles-based brands like BCBGMAXAZRIA and Kanye West's Yeezy line. But she was frustrated with the substandard options for underwear.
“I kept feeling like I could be doing something better," Titova said. So last June, she moved home to Massachusetts to launch Titov, a line of sexy yet supportive bralettes and underwear designed to fit larger sizes.
Her line, which is manufactured in East Boston, is already gaining traction: It's featured in the UnderClub monthly lingerie subscription box, and Titova held a Valentine's Day pop-up shop this week in Rebecca Minkoff's SoHo store. Titova, 26, has a specific audience in mind for Titov: women of a certain age.
“Women over 45 are neglected in this space. They don't see themselves reflected in any brand because every model is a 22-year-old," she said. She's now partnering with the company Divorceify — which offers support for people ending their marriages — to offer a giveaway for women who are seeking a fresh start.
Women now rank “sexiness" eighth when asked about why they purchase intimates, according to research from The NPD Group. Instead, support and comfort top the list.
“I don't think that Free People or Neiman would have even talked to us unless their teams were like: 'We need to move away from sexy, constrictive garments,' " said Mullan, of Uwila Warrior.
“Our line is all about comfort and fit. The whole idea is that it doesn't come off in five minutes."

Texto completo: If both the deepest and shallowest repercussions of walking around with a surgical mask in a time of coronavirus can be experienced by one single person, Jeannie Ding, a Boston University junior with an It girl vibe, is that person.
It was a Friday afternoon in early February and she'd recently returned to BU from her native province in China, Jiangxi. It's about a four-hour drive from Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and because she had the sniffles, and was worried about the disease, she's been wearing one of those cheap surgical face masks, sometimes covering her mouth and nose, sometimes, admittedly, looped behind her ears and resting under her chin (but more on this in a moment).
First, the serious incident: Ding was on the B Line, she said, when a Chinese-American man began yelling at her in Chinese, screaming that she shouldn't wear a mask because it would spread the ugly stereotype of Asian people spreading disease. “He said I was bringing shame to all the Chinese people," Ding said.
Now the more frivolous side, which explains why her mask was not currently covering her nose and mouth. “I feel like it's not polite when I'm wearing my mask and talking to people," she said. And: “If I put on makeup but no one can see my face it doesn't make sense." Her lipstick was covet-worthy MAC.
More than a month into the coronavirus scare, our relationship with masks is complicated. Unsure if they actually work at keeping us safe, we're nonetheless hoarding them and at the same time suspicious of anyone who actually wears one. Not so many people are wearing masks that it's common, but at the same time, enough people are wearing them that it's become a thing around Boston.
When a mask appears, in a packed T car — or even just passing by on the sidewalk — you can almost hear the unasked questions: Are you sick? Or trying not to get sick?
The masks and fear of the coronavirus are fueling anti-Chinese racism, and also increasing suspicion of people with compromised immune systems whose mask use predates the outbreak.
Nicki Kattouf, a colon cancer survivor, is in the latter category. She wore a mask when undergoing treatment, and although she's a confident person, the looks from strangers didn't make her feel great.
“I didn't want people to think I had the plague," said Kattouf, a field marketing manager for a staffing agency in Boston, “but I couldn't go person to person saying, 'I'm going through chemo, you will not catch what I have.' "
Molly Kruko, an administrative assistant at MIT who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, wears a mask because medication she takes suppresses her immune system.
Unwilling to jeopardize her health “for the judgment of others," she nonetheless chooses masks intended to look nonthreatening.
She's got one decorated with unicorns, another with dogs, a third with a floral print. All come from a San Francisco firm called Vogmask, where the emphasis is on serious protection from airborne particles — but in an Instagram-friendly style. “Vogmask speaks unpretentious Californian," the mission statement reads, “and always strives to be a positive voice for the environment and humanity."
Kruko worked for years in Japan, she said, where people regularly wear masks to filter out germs and pollutants. And as someone susceptible to chest infections even before taking medicine for MS, she loved the trend.
“I was always a little jealous," Kruko said. “Here it's not socially acceptable."
A face mask just made the red carpet at the Grammy Awards when the teenage singing star Billie Eilish rocked a sheer black Gucci number. But it's safe to say that craze-wise, in this country, masks will not be the next athleisure.
That's in contrast to countries such as China, according to a medical anthropologist, where masks are much more than simply a way to protect yourself from infection.
“In the West, the image of Asian people with masks is sometimes wielded, deliberately or not, as a signifier of otherness," Christos Lynteris, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, wrote in The New York Times. “But in East Asia, the act of wearing a mask is a gesture that communicates solidarity during an epidemic — a time when a community is vulnerable to being divided by fear, between the healthy and the sick."
The Centers for Disease Control is not recommending that the general public in the United States wear masks to protect themselves from respiratory viruses. But with the director of the World Health Organization calling the coronavirus a “very grave threat to the world," people nonetheless are on heightened germ alert.
On a recent day in Coolidge Corner, for example, Trader Joe's beloved food-sample station was sampling hand sanitizer, and it was “going like hot cakes," according to the employee at the station.
Back at BU, where the Chinese Students Association recently handed out masks, Kaiwen Qian, a junior from Shanghai, was decidedly not wearing a mask. Why not? Didn't his parents back home want him to wear one? “Yes," he said, before making a confession: to make them happy, he bought a box, and, to prove it, showed it to them on WeChat, China's most popular messaging app.
Alas, filial concern did not extend to actually wearing the mask. “I don't think I'll get sick," he said. “But I want my parents to feel safe."

Texto completo: OFF THE CHARTS
Through April 12. At the MIT Visual Arts Center, 20 Ames St., Cambridge. 617-253-4680, listart.mit.edu
If you watched the Super Bowl, you likely missed Christine Sun Kim. As Demi Lovato stood at the 50-yard line to sing the national anthem, Kim was positioned at the 40 — to interpret the song into American Sign Language. A day later, her byline turned up in The New York Times with an essay that outlined the ups and downs of her experience.
Last week, MIT List Visual Arts Center opened an exhibition of works by the California-born, Berlin-based artist. The show features a dozen hand-drawn infographics, each breaking down a personal decision from Kim's life. We caught up with the artist via e-mail to ask about the MIT show and the Super Bowl. The interview has been condensed and lightly edited.
Q. You recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times about your experience signing the national anthem and “America the Beautiful" at the Super Bowl. How could that experience be improved for you and the viewers?
A. I'm grateful that the National Association of the Deaf and the NFL gave me this opportunity to sign the anthem. The whole experience was incredible and the Jumbotrons in the stadium showed me in picture-in-picture (PIP) the entire time. It's worth mentioning that I lost my [expletitive] when Jennifer Lopez and Shakira came out for the halftime performance!
As for the viewers outside the stadium, I think the best solution would be to do PIP on the television broadcast so that everyone can watch together. Or the other option is to truly commit to the separate feed for ASL users only, without cutting away from the performer.
Q. Do you think that experience will make it into your art?
A. I'm sure it'll seep into my practice somehow. I've been thinking about patriotism and choreography in general.
Q. If you had to describe your upcoming MIT exhibition in three words, what would they be?
A. More pie charts.
Q. Tell me why you drew them with charcoal.
A. I love how messy charcoal is and how I can show these drawings in such a clean space like this.
Q. What's your favorite piece in the exhibition? Why?
A. I recently made three new drawings that offer three different POVs of the alphabet in American Sign Language: speller, bird, and lurker. So they're my current favorites. The rest are mostly about my personal decisions as a deaf person.
Q. You also chose to incorporate an audio installation. Tell me about it.
A. I did not want to play songs for my child that I am not familiar with because I'd like to know exactly what she's listening to. So I wrote a score and invited seven parent-artists to make songs plus write a description to make it conceptually accessible for deaf people including myself. It's called “One Week of Lullabies for Roux."
Q. What lessons do you hope audiences walk away with after seeing your collection?
A. No lessons, just want it to be something that sits in the back of their mind, and stays with them in terms of respecting our deafness and sign language.

Trump pushes back at Barr's remarks; President asserts he has a 'legal right' to intervene in criminal cases after attorney general's complaint.

Texto completo: President Trump slapped back Friday at one of his most loyal Cabinet secretaries, a day after Atty. Gen. William Barr took the rare step of rebuking his boss in public, complaining that the president's tweets and public statements on criminal cases were making his job "impossible."
In response, Trump tweeted that he had a "legal right" to ask Barr to intervene in a criminal proceeding, a provocative assertion that raised alarms over whether the Justice Department could remain an impartial law enforcement agency, free from political pressure.
The sparring added to days of anger and tumult in the Justice Department after the president slammed career prosecutors who had sought a stiff prison term for Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant, and Barr overruled their sentencing recommendation. The four prosecutors withdrew from the case in protest; one of them resigned.

Barr has been one of Trump's most helpful defenders -- choreographing what critics called a misleading public release last spring of the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and opening investigations into former Justice Department officials whom Trump has publicly criticized.
In a decision likely to rankle the president, however, the Justice Department closed a politically sensitive criminal investigation on Friday into former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, one of Trump's regular punching bags at campaign rallies and on Twitter for his role in the Russia investigation.
McCabe was fired in March 2018, less than two days before he was scheduled to retire and collect his pension, over allegations that he had lied to investigators about disclosures of sensitive information to a reporter. Any prosecution would have been hampered by Trump's harsh comments and tweets about McCabe, according to former prosecutors.
"At long last, justice has been done in this matter," McCabe's lawyers said in a statement Friday. "We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought."
Since taking office, Trump has lashed out even at close allies whom he deems disloyal. But since the Senate acquitted him of impeachment charges last week, he has settled scores large and small, exacting payback against a highly decorated Army officer at the White House, a U.S. diplomat in Europe, a senior Treasury Department nominee, and others, for their role in the impeachment and other investigations.
Although Stone was convicted of seven felonies, reports that prosecutors had recommended seven to nine years in prison appeared to outrage the president. After denouncing it as a "miscarriage of justice," Trump sharply criticized the prosecutors, the federal judge and even the forewoman of the jury, suggesting she "had significant bias."
Trump also cast off other traditional limits on his executive authority. On Thursday, shortly before New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo visited the White House to seek relief from new restrictions on New York residents who return from overseas travel, the president tweeted that New York "must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits & harassment" of his businesses and taxes.
But Trump's spat with the Justice Department has created a new crisis point in an administration that careens between them.
In an explosive interview with ABC News on Thursday, Barr expressed frustration with the president's jarring comments on criminal cases, saying the president's tweets and public statements were making it "impossible for me to do my job."
"I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases," Barr said, adding that the president had never asked him to intervene in a specific case.
While many White House aides have chafed about Trump privately, or in public after quitting or getting fired, Barr is a rare sitting Cabinet officer to push back in public, saying, "I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody."
Barr warned that the president's comments "about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases" raised questions about whether "we're doing our work with integrity."
Barr had privately asked Trump on a number of occasions to stop tweeting about criminal matters because the commentary was casting a shadow over the department's work, according to a personal familiar with the matter.
Barr's criticism also reflected anger in the broader legal community, which fears Trump's attempts to interfere in cases involving friends, allies and himself undermines the rule of law. Barr has agreed to testify on March 31 before House Democrats, where he will have to defend his decision to overrule his line prosecutors.
Trump and White House officials were surprised by Barr's TV broadside, an administration official said. The interview was hastily arranged to allow Barr to explain why he had overruled the initial seven- to nine-year sentencing recommendation, and had filed a second memo the next day that urged the judge to be more lenient.
On Friday, Trump fired back on Twitter, quoting Barr saying the president had not asked him to intervene in a criminal case. "This doesn't mean," Trump added, "that I do not have, as president, the legal right to do so. I do, but I have so far chosen not to!"
Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign advisor and former Stone associate, believes Trump's pique at Barr is genuine but noted that he held himself back from punching Barr for longer than usual.
"You've had a full 14 hours at least between the interview, the news cycle, and his tweet, so that shows some restraint," he said Friday.
Nunberg said he believes Trump is setting a marker for actions yet to come, including a potential pardon of Stone. "He's not going to defer any legal, constitutional authority to anyone at this point, especially having gone through impeachment," he said.
Given the competing pressures on Barr, both critics and allies have questioned whether his critique of Trump was cleared with the White House in an orchestrated effort to give the attorney general political cover.
White House officials, who said in a statement that "the president wasn't bothered by the comments at all," pointed out that Barr is taking Trump's side on investigations of the president.
Eric Bolling, a conservative television host who speaks with Trump and other White House officials regularly, said "there's mutual respect for each other," and that Trump's tweets are no surprise to Barr.
"Barr's comments to ABC were more for the American people than to influence President Trump," he said. "I'm sure he realizes President Trump wouldn't change his method of information delivery over Barr's comments."
Stone was convicted in November of lying to a House committee, obstructing Congress and witness tampering. He is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Feb. 20, and she has the authority to accept or reject the Justice Department's sentencing recommendations.
Stone's lawyers submitted court papers Friday demanding a new trial, filing the request and supporting documents under seal, according to news accounts. Jackson, who disclosed the filing in a court order, gave prosecutors until Tuesday to respond, but the legal motion could delay Stone's sentencing.
The U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which prosecuted Stone, is also handling the prosecution of Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security advisor. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with a Russian diplomat, but he is seeking to withdraw his plea.
The Justice Department is conducting a review of how the investigation and prosecution of Flynn was handled, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said the probe, which was first reported by the New York Times, is being conducted jointly with the prosecutor assigned to the case, Brandon Van Grack.

'Sanctuary' cities focus of new ICE deployment; Agency, citing lack of cooperation, will send border agents to L.A., 8 other areas to assist in migrant arrests.

Texto completo: Federal immigration officials confirmed Friday that border agents and officers, including those in tactical units, will be deployed in Los Angeles and other so-called sanctuary cities to assist in the arrests of immigrants in the country illegally.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman confirmed details of the planned deployment that were first reported in the New York Times. The agency referred further questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
CBP will deploy 50 Border Patrol agents and 50 field operations customs officers in nine areas, according to the agency. Specially trained officers will be sent to cities including Chicago and New York.

Additional agents are expected to be sent to San Francisco, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit and Newark, N.J., and other cities, according to the agency. The deployment of the teams will run from February through May.
CBP agents and officers being detailed to help ICE will come from different sectors and job positions, including some trained in tactical operations, according to the agency.
"ICE is utilizing CBP to supplement enforcement activity in response to the resource challenges stemming from sanctuary city policies," ICE Director Matthew Albence said in a statement.
Albence said in the statement that the action was being taken in response to sanctuary-city law enforcement agencies not cooperating with federal authorities by turning over immigrants being held in local jails. As a result, the statement continued, federal officers "are forced to make at-large arrests of criminal aliens who have been released into communities."
"This effort requires a significant amount of additional time and resources," Albence said. "When sanctuary cities release these criminals back to the street, it increases the occurrence of preventable crimes, and more importantly, preventable victims."
The number of non- detained cases increased from 2.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to over 3.2 million in the following fiscal year, according to DHS.
"With 5,300 ERO [Enforcement and Removal Operations] law enforcement officers -- some of whom were detailed to the border -- ICE does not have sufficient resources to effectively manage the sustained increase in non-detained cases which is exacerbated by the rise of sanctuary jurisdictions," the agency said in a statement.
Agents being deployed include those within the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or BORTAC, an official confirmed. The unit "provides an immediate response capability to emergent and high-risk incidents requiring specialized skills and tactics," according to the CBP website.
John Sandweg, who headed ICE during the administration of former President Obama, called the latest move by the Trump administration "dangerous."
"You're pulling critical manpower off the border and you're doing it really candidly for a political show of force," Sandweg said. "You're also forcing the BORTAC units to operate in a dramatically different environment than what they're used to. It takes different skill sets to operate in an urban environment than it does in a border environment."
Sandweg called it a move "to offend so-called sanctuary cities ... by deploying a bunch of Army-looking Border Patrol agents."
"No ICE agent who is honest to you would ever say they need Border Patrol to bail them out. Ever," he continued. "It's insulting to ICE agents, who are more than capable enough to take care of any threats out there and have and do."
An official familiar with the deployment said BORTAC teams were sent not because they're tactical units, but rather because they could deploy the quickest.
"Everybody's going to be dressed similar to an ICE officer," the official said, and Border Patrol agents will follow the lead of ICE counterparts. "They're being led by ICE. These are ICE-led daily operations."
He said the BORTAC teams were sent to cities where ICE needed help, not based on local sanctuary city policies, noting that Houston is not a sanctuary city.
"The reason those cities were chosen is because that's where there was a greater need for additional staffing," he said. "Our goal is not to concern people."
But the deployment could set up another clash between the Trump administration and cities such as L.A. and San Francisco that have vowed their law enforcement officials would not aid ICE in its sweeps.
It is unclear what the deployment may look like in Los Angeles. An L.A.-area ICE spokesperson said the agency would not discuss planned operations or specific resource allocations.
On Friday, in a move not seen before in California, ICE officials served four administrative subpoenas to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department for information on four Mexican nationals wanted for deportation. The tactic was used Jan. 15 in Denver for what was believed to be the first time, then subsequently in New York and Connecticut. The subpoenas are not court-ordered or signed by a judge, but ICE said it could pursue such a court order if compliance is not forthcoming.
Last year, ICE launched a national operation aimed at making thousands of arrests. Agencies such as the L.A. Police Department pushed back. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who stood alongside LAPD Chief Michel Moore, told residents they did not have to open their doors for an ICE agent who did not have a warrant signed by a judge.
In a statement released Friday afternoon, Moore wrote, "LAPD has received no information from ICE regarding any special deployments in the Los Angeles region. Consistent with our long-standing practices, we have not and will not participate in any immigration enforcement activities. We continue our work building relationships with all immigrant communities in our shared effort to keep Los Angeles safe."
L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva also released a statement Friday saying, "I strongly oppose this irresponsible deployment of federal SWAT agents in Los Angeles County for civil immigration enforcement.
"This poorly thought-out plan can only be seen as a tactic to intimidate an already vulnerable population and drive them deeper into the shadows," the statement said. "We are not any safer if an entire segment of our population is afraid to report crimes to local law enforcement."
The relationship between ICE and many local law enforcement agencies has long been fraught. Since Trump took office, it has grown only more tenuous as police grapple with maintaining communication with ICE while also balancing transparency with community and civic leaders.
Those tensions are especially evident in California, where local law enforcement must abide by a "sanctuary" law, Senate Bill 54, which went into effect last year to provide protection for immigrants in the country illegally. In L.A., the Police Department stopped engaging in joint operations with ICE that directly involve civil immigration enforcement and no longer transfers people with certain minor criminal convictions to ICE custody.
"This is transparent retaliation against local governments for refusing to do the administration's bidding," Naureen Shah, senior policy and advocacy counsel on immigrants' rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. "It will put lives at risk by further militarizing our streets. Local governments should not face reprisals for focusing on local community needs and using taxpayer money responsibly, instead of helping to deport and detain community members."
Advocates said that rapid response networks, which provide hotlines for immigrants facing arrest by immigration officers and dispatch trained legal observers to raids, will be on high alert over the weekend.
Hamid Yazdan Panah, advocacy director of Immigrant Defense Advocates in the Bay Area, said the operation is part of a repeated pattern by the Trump administration of using fear for political gain.
"This administration has a practice of trying to bully people into obtaining what it wants. But I think sanctuary cities stand on firm legal ground," Yazdan Panah said. "Sanctuary policies are a reflection of the shared values and the fabric of that community. This escalation isn't going to stop that."

Texto completo: There are "only" eight candidates left in the Democratic primary and we still do not know who won Iowa. Here is a recap of what you might have missed from a busy week in the Democratic primary.
Well, that was exhausting.
One and a half states down, 48.5 to go. Let's catch you up on what happened during one of the most eventful stretches of the 2020 race so far.
New Hampshire is done
New Hampshire voters went to the polls on Tuesday, and we got results several hours later. Amazing!
The summary: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won; former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was a close second; and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota came in a surprisingly strong third.
That was not great news for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who placed fourth with less than 10 percent of the vote. And the results were very bad for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who finished fifth.
You can see the full results here, and take a look at five takeaways from the primary.
In a news analysis, Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck wrote that one loser was the Democratic establishment.
Other colleagues reported that Mr. Sanders's rise has made some Democrats nervous. The Upshot examined the math that could add up to a Sanders nomination.
And the final days of campaigning in New Hampshire showed a new dynamic: Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders trying fiercely to create a two-person race.
Iowa is not
We regret to inform you that we still don't know who won the Iowa caucuses.
Every precinct has reported its results, and they show Mr. Buttigieg with the slightest of leads over Mr. Sanders in the state delegate equivalent count. But both campaigns requested partial recanvasses this week based on irregularities and miscalculations in specific precincts, and the Iowa Democratic Party agreed to check the numbers.
If the errors Mr. Sanders's campaign reported were all verified, he would net about six state delegate equivalents, which would move him into first place. That would earn him the one extra national delegate reserved for the statewide winner. But if the errors Mr. Buttigieg's campaign reported were all verified, he would expand his lead over Mr. Sanders by about 14 state delegate equivalents.
As recriminations continued to fly, Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, announced his resignation on Wednesday. The party will choose an interim leader this weekend.
Our colleagues Reid J. Epstein, Sydney Ember, Trip Gabriel and Mike Baker have the definitive account of how the Iowa caucuses fell apart.
As if Iowa hadn't given Democrats enough heartburn already, the relatively low turnout there had some people worried, though the turnout in New Hampshire was higher.
Next up are the Nevada caucuses, which will be administered differently from Iowa's, as our colleague Isabella Grullón Paz reports. A powerful union in Nevada, the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226, declined to endorse a candidate this week.
And then there were eight
Three candidates ended their campaigns after dismal finishes in New Hampshire: the entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2.8 percent of the vote), former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts (0.4 percent) and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado (0.3 percent).
There are now "only" eight candidates in the Democratic race. That is a huge post-New Hampshire field by any historical standard, but compared with the 24-person free-for-all we had a few months ago, it's luxuriously manageable.
Read our full reports on the departures of Mr. Bennet, Mr. Patrick and Mr. Yang. (You can read an exit interview with Mr. Yang here.)
We're still tracking the field here.
A bumpy week for Bloomberg
Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City faced a barrage of criticism this week after two sets of old remarks resurfaced.
The first recording, which was posted on Twitter on Monday, was from a 2015 appearance Mr. Bloomberg made at the Aspen Institute. In the clip, he staunchly defended stop-and-frisk policing, a tactic that his mayoral administration used disproportionately against black men and Latinos, and that he apologized for only on the eve of his presidential campaign.
"Ninety-five percent of your murders -- murderers and murder victims -- fit one M.O.," he said. "You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 15 to 25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city."
Later in the week, comments surfaced from a forum Mr. Bloomberg attended in 2008. He claimed the end of redlining, a racially discriminatory housing practice, had helped cause the financial crisis.
Among those who condemned Mr. Bloomberg's remarks was Ms. Warren, who told supporters on Thursday that his comments should disqualify him from becoming the Democratic nominee.
A look at the polls
There is no doubt that Mr. Sanders is the new Democratic front-runner, as evidenced not only by his performances in Iowa and New Hampshire but also by two national polls released this week.
A Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed Mr. Sanders at 25 percent, eight points ahead of Mr. Biden -- his first lead outside the margin of error in a national debate-qualifying poll. A Monmouth poll released the next day showed an even larger lead, 26 percent to 16 percent.
Monmouth had Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg tied for third with 13 percent apiece, while Quinnipiac had Ms. Warren at 14 and Mr. Buttigieg at 10. Mr. Bloomberg was also in double digits in both polls -- 15 percent in Quinnipiac and 11 percent in Monmouth -- putting him one poll away from qualifying for next week's debate.
Our resident polling expert Giovanni Russonello wrote about Mr. Sanders's rise.
Policies
Mr. Bloomberg released short plans this week on two crucial issues -- immigration and reproductive rights -- on which the other major candidates long ago announced their positions.
In his immigration plan, he pledged to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, set a target of 125,000 for refugee resettlement and end the backlog of naturalization applications. He also said he would "reform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection," but gave no details.
His reproductive rights plan calls for codifying Roe v. Wade, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and ending the domestic and global "gag rules" -- all points on which the Democratic field is united. Mr. Bloomberg also said he would "encourage states" to allow the prescription of birth control through telemedicine and to authorize a wider variety of medical professionals to perform abortions.
In other policy news:
Ms. Warren released an agenda for Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, which draws on a long list of her existing plans.

Texto completo: Suspicions that Chuckie O'Brien was involved in the union boss's disappearance trailed him for 45 years.
Charles O'Brien, a close associate of the union boss Jimmy Hoffa who spent decades denying that he was involved in Hoffa's disappearance and presumed murder in 1975, died on Thursday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 86.
His stepson, Jack Goldsmith, a law professor at Harvard University, said the cause appeared to be a heart attack.
Mr. O'Brien, widely known as Chuckie, was a child when he first met Hoffa in about 1943, and the two became close. Hoffa referred to him as "my other son," and he was Hoffa's closest assistant in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s, including from 1957 to 1971, when Hoffa was president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
When Hoffa disappeared in a Detroit suburb in 1975 (a judge declared him "presumed dead" in 1982, though no body has been found), Mr. O'Brien came under suspicion, with news accounts and some law enforcement authorities speculating that he drove Hoffa to a fatal encounter. Mr. O'Brien, although his accounts of the events surrounding the disappearance were sometimes vague, maintained that he had not been involved and that he would never have sold out his friend and mentor.
"I'm tired of being accused of something I didn't do," he told The Miami Herald in 1985. "If I thought something was gonna happen to the old man, it wouldn't have happened to him. Because if someone was gonna do harm to Mr. Hoffa, they were gonna have to do harm to me first."
The suspicions, though, persisted. They even made it into Martin Scorsese's recent film "The Irishman," in which Mr. O'Brien is portrayed by Jesse Plemons. Professor Goldsmith, who wrote the 2019 book "In Hoffa's Shadow: A Stepfather, a Disappearance in Detroit, and My Search for the Truth," has been a strong defender of his stepfather and has fought to counter the longstanding assumption that he was involved in the crime.
"The circumstantial case against Chuckie fell apart long ago," he wrote last month in an essay for The New York Times that was critical of the film, "and his known whereabouts on the fateful day make it practically impossible that he picked up Mr. Hoffa. Unfortunately, the government never made this information public. And so Chuckie's innocence in one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century remains mostly hidden, his guilt remains publicly presumed, his honor remains soiled."
Charles Lenton O'Brien was born on Dec. 20, 1933, in Kansas City, Mo. His father, also named Charles, worked in a gas station and was a driver and bodyguard for a mobster named Charles Binaggio. He abandoned the family when his son was 7, after which Mr. O'Brien's mother, Sylvia Pagano, alternating between living in Kansas City and Detroit, often left Chuckie in the care of others.
Mr. O'Brien was 9 when he first met Hoffa.
"When he flashed his heartwarming smile at me," Mr. O'Brien said in an interview for Professor Goldsmith's book, "I knew we were going to be close."
He was sometimes described as Hoffa's foster son or as having been raised by him, but Professor Goldsmith, in his book, said neither was true. Yet Mr. O'Brien did spend considerable time with Hoffa and his family and helped organize picket lines and other union activities while still a boy. After he graduated from Glennon High School in Kansas City in 1952 and married Mary Ann Giaramita, he settled in Michigan, where Hoffa was by then a top state Teamsters official. Eventually he persuaded Hoffa to hire him as an organizer.
Mr. O'Brien became Hoffa's trusted assistant; Mario Puzo once said he modeled the character Tom Hagen in "The Godfather" -- the "consigliere" -- after what he had heard about him. Mr. O'Brien himself, though, played down his advisory role. "I didn't advise Hoffa -- he advised me," he said.
"I'd be with him," he said. "If something had to be done, I did it."
Mr. O'Brien accompanied Hoffa in 1967 when he reported to the federal authorities to begin serving a prison sentence on bribery and fraud convictions. President Richard M. Nixon commuted Hoffa's sentence in late 1971. His disappearance four years later was often thought to be related to his efforts to return to power in the union.
Mr. O'Brien's first marriage ended in divorce. In 1975, just weeks before Hoffa disappeared, he married Brenda Berger, Professor Goldsmith's mother. They divorced in the 1980s but continued to live together until Mr. O'Brien's death, Professor Goldsmith said.
In addition to him, Mr. O'Brien is survived by two children from his first marriage, Charles and Josephine; two other stepsons, Brett Berger O'Brien and Steven Carter O'Brien; and several grandchildren.
In his recent Times essay, Professor Goldsmith said that Mr. O'Brien had given him a rather blunt assessment of "The Irishman" and its resurrection of the old allegations. "One of the greatest fake movies I ever saw," he called it.
He added, according to Professor Goldsmith: "Hollywood could turn a monkey into a peanut. That's their business. They don't care about the truth. It's entertainment."

Texto completo: A new romantic comedy debuts on Freeform. And the childhood story of a girl and her dog comes to Disney Plus.
What's on TV
THE THING ABOUT HARRY (2020) 8 p.m. on Freeform. Created by the ABC-friendly Peter Paige -- who directed "The Fosters" and its spinoff, "Good Trouble" -- "The Thing About Harry" is a heartwarming rom-com that debuts just after Valentine's Day. The movie, which takes place on the holiday itself, details the unraveling of a high school grudge between Sam (Jake Borelli) and Harry (Niko Terho) when they find themselves on a long road trip together. Sam, who has been proudly gay and uniquely himself since high school, has failed to get along with Harry, a former jock. But as the two spend time together, Sam learns that Harry is also gay, opening up the possibility for romance. The cast is supplemented by Netflix stars Britt Baron and Karamo Brown.
SHAFT (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. This fifth installation of the "Shaft" movies unites three generations of John Shafts: two detectives-gone-rogue and one M.I.T.-educated millennial. The 2019 version finds success in its characters and their dialogues, and the depiction of John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) shifts from an action hero to a politically incorrect dad. The Shaft newcomer, JJ (Jessie T. Usher), essentially serves as a reminder of contemporary issues and as a catalyst for shootouts. However, "story coherence has never been the point with Shaft," A.O. Scott reminds us in his review in The New York Times. He adds: "He's all about presence and presentation, and the grace and guile required to deal with the bad guys, the Man and of course all those women." Jackson -- who revived the series -- stars again, and Richard Roundtree -- the original Shaft -- returns as JJ's great-uncle.
What's Streaming
BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE Stream on Disney Plus. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This story of a 10-year-old girl, her father, a small Southern town and a dog named Winn-Dixie is based on the 2000 Kate DiCamillo novel with the same title. It begins when Opal Buloni (AnnaSophia Robb) and her father (Jeff Daniels) move into a trailer park in a sleepy Florida town called Naomi. One day, Opal finds a stray dog wreaking havoc in a grocery store, and she decides to take him home. With the help of her new friend, whom she names Winn-Dixie (after the grocery store), Opal is able to connect with the residents of Naomi and with her closed-off father. In her review for The Times, Anita Gates wrote, "It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. "
UTOPIA FALLS Stream on Hulu. In this futuristic sci-fi series, which takes place in the last surviving human colony on earth, ancestral worship and societal status are achieved through an annual music-and-dance competition for which 24 teenagers are invited to partake. When one of the contestants, Aliyah (Robyn Alomar), discovers the long-lost genre hip-hop, she begins to question the values her colony is based upon. As the series progresses, she and other competitors use hip-hop to establish freedom from their government.

Texto completo: They have been at odds since October, but the tension related to protests in Hong Kong is showing faint signs of easing as the N.B.A. honors its All-Stars.
The day after Kobe Bryant died, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, posted a statement on Twitter: "Saddened by the tragic loss of #KobeBryant. An inspiration for many and a legend of his generation, he will always be remembered for his contribution to the world of sport and to #ChinaUS people-to-people exchanges."
Though Bryant was a huge star in the country -- even the most popular sports figure, for awhile -- the ambassador's message was notable. China and the N.B.A. have been on the outs since October, when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, shared an image on Twitter that showed support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. This roiled the Chinese government and instantly derailed decades of league efforts to court the country's sizable basketball audience, initiating a conflict at the rare intersection of sports, domestic politics, corporate profits and international relations.
Four months later, China is grappling with the coronavirus that has sickened thousands of its people and disrupted the economy, and as the N.B.A. embarks on its signature All-Star weekend, in Chicago, there are signs that tension between the two sides has begun to dissipate, even beyond the tweet from Cui.
"Right now, our focus is on working with global health organizations to provide whatever assistance we can to the people of China in response to the coronavirus outbreak," N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told The New York Times on Thursday in an emailed statement. "Many of our Chinese partners were unable to attend our N.B.A. All-Star events because of travel restrictions, but all of the weekend's events will be carried in China on Tencent."
This, too, is notable. Tencent, the Chinese streaming network, after initially stopping its coverage, has been showing up to three games a night. China's state-run television network, China Central Television, canceled its broadcasts of the preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Nets and several other related league events in the aftermath of Morey's tweet. Silver, at a live event soon after, said the Chinese government had demanded that Morey be fired -- but he immediately said no. The N.B.A. has not been back on CCTV since.
There are those around the league who believe there is a chance that CCTV airs the N.B.A. All-Star Game -- and more games after that. Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba and owner of the Nets, recently told Bloomberg, "Once you're on the air, everything will come back." (Tsai declined to comment.)
At the time of the initial controversy, Yao Ming, the former Rockets great and chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, was described as "extremely hot" by Silver over the situation. But he traveled to the United States last month to attend a memorial service for David Stern, the former commissioner of the N.B.A. Silver and Yao spoke at the memorial, according to a source familiar with the discussion who was not authorized to disclose it publicly. Last week, Huang Ping, the Chinese consulate general, thanked the league at a media briefing in New York for donating $ 1.4 million to the Hubei Province, the center of the coronavirus, to help fight its spread. Several N.B.A. teams marked the Chinese New Year with promotions at their arenas, as they have in other years.
While the protests in Hong Kong remain a hot button topic in China, as the reaction to Morey showed, Kristen Looney, an assistant professor of Asian studies and government at Georgetown University, said China could choose to move on as if nothing happened.
"They do that occasionally. It's big business for them too, having the N.B.A. in China," Looney said. "Hundreds of millions of people watch basketball in China -- and I know they're unhappy with lack of access. But I doubt anything happens during this N.B.A. season, unless the government decides that bringing the game back would be a welcome distraction from the public health crisis."
The stakes are high for the league. Since 2004, the N.B.A. has played 28 games in China. Star players travel every year for promotional tours. Shoe sales are a major source of revenue for manufacturers. There are more basketball fans in China, a country with 1.4 billion residents, than in the U.S., which has a population of 330 million. The league maintains its business in China with about 200 employees in offices in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong. It also has an office in Taiwan, the democratic island claimed by Beijing that has asserted its independence from China.
"I see it as something that's going to take time," said Todd Ramasar, an N.B.A. agent with overseas clients who has also negotiated deals in China. "I don't think it's something as simple as saying this is centered around the N.B.A. This is much bigger than that."
The timing of the All-Star game, on Sunday, may be a stroke of good luck for the N.B.A. because of the larger domestic politics involved. On Friday, the first phase of the trade deal struck last month between China and the U.S. will take effect, signaling the warmest point in the relationship between the two countries since President Trump took office.
Earlier this month, at his State of the Union speech, Trump said, "We have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi," referring to China's leader, Xi Jinping. On Feb. 7, Trump praised Xi for the Chinese government's response to the coronavirus.
But there is also mixed messaging -- an indication of the often fraught relationship between the two countries. At the end of January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the ruling party in China the "the central threat of our times."
It is unclear what the business impact of the China fallout has been for the N.B.A. One indicator is the league's salary cap, the amount that each team can spend on player contracts each season. It is determined by the amount of basketball related income the N.B.A. takes in. Next season, it is projected to be $ 116 million, an increase from $ 109.1 million this season, according to ESPN -- an indication that the league is in a healthy place. However, projections can change. And China is one of several external revenue streams.
There are also critics in America who believe that the league should limit its dealings with an authoritarian government.
At home, the N.B.A. faced blowback from politicians all over the spectrum following Morey's Twitter post, which read "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong." The critics, including many Democratic presidential candidates and their ideological foes, like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, accused the N.B.A. of capitulating to a repressive regime to increase its bottom line. The league said at the time that the anger from the Chinese mainland was "regrettable" and Morey had "deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China." The Chinese version of the statement read differently and said that the league was "extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment" by Morey. Morey has not spoken about the issue publicly since a follow-up statement in which he said he did not mean to "cause any offense." He declined to comment for this article.
In the months since, the United States has had to confront the fact that many businesses have interests in China. Bob Iger, the chief executive officer of Disney, said at a conference in October that he would not criticize China's handling of the Hong Kong protesters because "to take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake. I just don't believe it's something we should engage in a public manner." The comments went unmentioned by many of the same politicians who blasted the N.B.A.
Silver has also made clear that he would like the league to make amends with China, regardless of the optics of doing business with an oppressive regime. Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman, said the league has "no plans to stop distributing our games in China."
"We continue to believe in the unique power of sports to bring people together across cultures," Bass said.

Texto completo: The lawyer, who represented Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Trump, was found guilty of charges including attempted extortion and honest services fraud.
Michael Avenatti, the brash lawyer best known for representing the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump, was convicted on Friday of trying to extort more than $ 20 million from the apparel giant Nike.
After three days of deliberations in the case, brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, a jury found him guilty on all three counts, including attempted extortion and honest services fraud. Mr. Avenatti, who is scheduled to be sentenced on June 17, could face more than 40 years in prison in the case. He is set to stand trial in a separate federal criminal case on May 19.
Mr. Avenatti was charged last spring with an array of federal crimes in both New York and California, where he lived. Though he spent much of last year free on bail, a judge revoked that deal in January -- after prosecutors argued that he was continuing to engage in criminal activity -- and Mr. Avenatti was in federal custody as he stood trial in New York this year.
In making their case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan specifically accused Mr. Avenatti of trying to extort money from Nike in exchange for evidence he said he had of misconduct by company employees in the recruitment of college basketball players. He demanded that Nike hire him to conduct an internal investigation into its criminal exposure, prosecutors said, contending that he had alternatively requested $ 22.5 million to buy his silence and resolve potential claims by a youth basketball coach whom he said he represented.
"Today a unanimous jury found Michael Avenatti guilty of misusing his client's information in an effort to extort tens of millions of dollars," Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement on Friday. "While the defendant may have tried to hide behind legal terms and a suit and tie, the jury clearly saw the defendant's scheme for what it was -- an old fashioned shakedown."
A lawyer for Mr. Avenatti, Scott Srebnick, said by email Friday that Mr. Avenatti planned to appeal the conviction. "Michael Avenatti has been a fighter his entire life," Mr. Srebnick wrote, saying he believed there was "substantial" basis for the appeal. "The inhumane conditions of solitary confinement he has endured over the past month weeks would break anyone but he remains strong," he said.
Many who had been former targets of Mr. Avenatti's public attacks celebrated Friday's verdict.
"Aged like a fine wine," Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, wrote on Twitter, posting an October 2018 message from Mr. Avenatti that had predicted the younger Mr. Trump would be indicted by the end of that year. "#Basta" Mr. Trump added in his message, referencing the hashtag, meaning "enough," that Mr. Avenatti had made his catchphrase.
As he rocketed to fame in 2018 and toyed with declaring a presidential run, Mr. Avenatti maintained a cocksure public image that masked disarray that became evident in a trail of civil disputes, bankruptcy filings and alleged financial crimes going back several years.
In a separate case still pending in California, Mr. Avenatti has been accused of tax crimes and financial fraud, including stealing millions of dollars from clients and of lying repeatedly about his business and income to an I.R.S. collection agent, creditors, a bankruptcy court and a bankruptcy trustee. He has pleaded not guilty.
Though Mr. Avenatti has suggested that he believes the charges against him are politically motivated, prosecutors have noted that the I.R.S.'s investigation of him dated to September 2016 -- before President Trump was elected and well before Mr. Avenatti began representing Ms. Daniels. He is scheduled to stand trial in the Central District of California this spring.
Mr. Avenatti has also been charged with stealing nearly $ 300,000 from Ms. Daniels, the client who propelled him to prominence in 2018. Prosecutors accused him last spring of taking part of Ms. Daniels's book advance and putting it toward his personal expenses, including dry cleaning, food deliveries and a monthly payment on a Ferrari.
On Friday, Ms. Daniels issued a statement on Instagram saying she was "not surprised his dishonesty has been revealed on a grand scale." Calling Mr. Avenatti "arrogant, fraudulent and overly aggressive," she added, "Although clearly a just result, I do feel sad for his children and foolish for believing his lies for so long."
Both cases that Mr. Avenatti brought on Ms. Daniels's behalf against the president were dismissed in federal court; in one, a defamation suit, she was ordered to pay Mr. Trump nearly $ 300,000 in legal fees.
Even as he faced multiple federal charges, Mr. Avenatti had sought out the spotlight and the news media, which had helped boost his profile across more than 300 television appearances and countless interviews, some with The New York Times.
Last month, he continued to release a range of messages on Twitter, commenting on the impeachment of Mr. Trump, emphasizing his support of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the Democratic presidential primary and posting documents relating to his criminal defense. His messages, to an audience of roughly 760,000 followers -- fewer than the number he had in late 2018 -- stopped when he was jailed in mid-January.

Bryant Memorial To Be Tough Ticket

Texto completo: The event, which will commemorate the lives of Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, is Feb. 24 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, with limited tickets for the public.
Fans hoping to attend the official memorial for the late N.B.A. superstar Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, in Los Angeles this month will face a difficult time obtaining tickets, and they might have to spend big.
A "limited number of tickets" will be on sale to the public on Tuesday for as much as $ 224 each ahead of the Feb. 24 event at Staples Center, according to a Friday news release from the Lakers.
Gianna, 13, and Kobe, who retired in 2016 after starring for the Lakers for 20 years, died along with seven other people on Jan. 26 in a helicopter crash just outside Los Angeles.
There was no immediate information about how many total tickets will be for sale to the public. The tickets will be priced in three tiers: $ 224 for one, $ 224 for two or $ 24.02 for one. (Kobe played wearing the jersey No. 24 for the last 10 years of his career; Gianna, who also played basketball, wore the No. 2.) The rest of the tickets are reserved for friends, family and members of the N.B.A. community.
Though it was announced that proceeds from the ticket sales will go to the Bryants' recently renamed Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, there was swift backlash on social media against both the decision to charge for tickets and the cost of the top tier tickets, which many viewed as exorbitant.
Tickets were not sold for previous memorials held at Staples Center. Over 1 million people entered a lottery for 17,500 free tickets to attend Michael Jackson's memorial in 2009. Last year, all of the tickets for Nipsey Hussle's memorial were claimed in seconds. They were also free.
In an apparent attempt to eliminate scalping or reselling of the memorial tickets, they will be nontransferable and nonrefundable. Fans will have to register with TicketMaster's Verified Fan program for an opportunity to purchase tickets, which will be mobile only. There will be a two ticket purchase limit.
The area around Staples Center, including surrounding streets and the adjacent L.A. Live, a large outdoor plaza with jumbo video screens and restaurants, will be shut down to those without tickets to the memorial. The Lakers also said the memorial would not be shown on the public video screens there.
It will be broadcast by Spectrum SportsNet, which telecasts Lakers games in Southern California, and it is expected that ESPN and NBA TV will show portions or all of the memorial, though those plans have yet to be announced.

Police Misused Patriot Act, Newspaper Says

Texto completo: The police used an antiterror law to demand information about who leaked crime scene photos that she posted to social media.
The move by the New York Police Department against one of the city's biggest tabloids was unusual: It issued a subpoena demanding information about a New York Post reporter's Twitter account and cited an antiterror law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The legal maneuver has raised concerns that the department, the nation's largest police force, is taking aggressive steps to control the media's coverage of the agency.
The subpoena was issued Dec. 9, just days after Dermot F. Shea became police commissioner.
Before his promotion, Commissioner Shea was the head of the department's detective bureau, where he had gained a reputation for being reluctant to release information to reporters.
The subpoena sought internet service provider addresses, emails and other information affiliated with the Twitter account of Tina Moore, the chief police reporter for The Post.
The order was issued to Twitter, which refused to comply and notified The Post this week about the subpoena. After lawyers for the newspaper contacted the Police Department, the agency dropped its demand.
The police can under certain circumstances issue subpoenas directly, without seeking the approval of a judge.
The department was investigating the leaking of crime scene photos to Ms. Moore and was seeking information from between Oct. 9 and Oct. 14, 2019, when Ms. Moore posted images from a shooting that left four people dead, The Post said.
"We are conducting an investigation to identify the person who leaked crime scene photos," Sergeant Jessica McRorie, a police spokeswoman, said in a statement. "Tina Moore was never the focus of our investigation."
Iva Benson, a spokeswoman for The Post, issued a statement saying the Police Department's actions were "antithetical to a free press." "The Patriot Act was passed to make it easier to prevent deadly terror attacks," she said, "not help the government crack down on people who speak to reporters."
Free-speech advocates said the subpoena was an odd tactic, in part because New York State has some of the most stringent shield laws in the country and protects journalists from disclosing confidential information about their sources.
"The subpoena would have been unsuccessful and is kind of frivolous," said George Freeman, the director of the Media Law Resource Center, a nonprofit resource group for journalists, and a former lawyer for The New York Times. "New York law is very protective of reporter's news-gathering information."
The news of the subpoena came just days after a freelance photographer, Amr Alfiky, was detained after filming arrest of a man in Manhattan's Chinatown.
Mr. Alfiky, who has credentials from the Police Department identifying him as a news media photographer, refused orders from officers to stop filming, the police said.
He said he told officers that he was journalist. But the police said he was not displaying his credentials at the time, and he was arrested.
Mr. Alfiky was given a summons for disorderly conduct, said Mickey Osterreicher, his lawyer.
Police officials said the leak of the photos to Ms. Moore was a violation of the department's patrol guide. In certain cases, the police said, the unauthorized release of crime scene photos could be considered an obstruction of government administration, a misdemeanor under state law.
But free-speech experts said they did not understand why the Police Department, in its effort to investigate the leak, turned to the Patriot Act, a post-Sept. 11 statute that granted the federal government broad powers to surveil citizens.
"The total silliness, that they used the Patriot Act act as a basis for the subpoena in the first place," Mr. Freeman said. "Certainly, a private police investigation looking for a leaker is not what the Patriot Act is about."
The part of the act that the subpoena mentions, Section 211, refers to information and metadata transported over airwaves.
The seizure of journalists' records is typically decided in federal court and often involves classified information related to national security issues.
The Police Department's issuing of the order also raised worries among free-speech advocates about how the agency uses its subpoena power.
"One wonders whether they can just issue subpoenas willy-nilly, when anyone in the Police Department feels like it," Mr. Freeman said.

Texto completo: The New York City mayor, who was briefly a presidential candidate himself, is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Sanders in Nevada ahead of the caucuses there next week.
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, whose brief presidential campaign failed to get off the ground last year, endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination on Friday.
In a statement released by the Sanders campaign, Mr. de Blasio said he was supporting Mr. Sanders because he "stands with working families" and was the right candidate to take on President Trump.
"I have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that's exactly what Senator Sanders has championed for decades," Mr. de Blasio said.
His choice is a reversal from four years ago, when he endorsed Hillary Clinton over Mr. Sanders, but it is not entirely unexpected. He said last summer that in retrospect, he believed Mr. Sanders would have won the 2016 election if nominated.
It is also notable that Mr. de Blasio chose to make the endorsement only now, after Mr. Sanders's victory in New Hampshire and strong performance in Iowa have made him a clear front-runner for the nomination.
Mr. de Blasio was expected to travel with Mr. Sanders on Sunday and Monday in Nevada, where they will appear together at canvassing events ahead of the caucuses there on Feb. 22.
Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sanders have spoken several times since the mayor ended his presidential campaign in September. The mayor also spent time at Mr. Sanders's vacation home in Vermont in 2018. And Mr. Sanders swore Mr. de Blasio in at the inauguration for his second term as mayor.
Though Mr. de Blasio ran for mayor -- and, later, president -- on an unapologetically progressive platform, he has generally not endorsed progressive insurgents. He did not endorse Zephyr Teachout in 2014 or Cynthia Nixon in 2018 when they challenged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo from the left. Nor did he endorse Tiffany Cabán in the Queens district attorney's race last year, as Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both did.
Mr. de Blasio's backing adds to Mr. Sanders's list of endorsements, which includes numerous unions and grass-roots organizations as well as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
Mr. de Blasio was in the presidential race for only four months last year and never exceeded 1 percent in a debate-qualifying poll; even voters in New York did not support him. But in something of a twist, his predecessor as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has reached double digits in recent national polls with a veritable tsunami of spending from his personal fortune.

Texto completo: Caroline Baumann resigned as director of the design museum following an investigation into how she procured her wedding dress and the space for the ceremony.
Everything fell into place for Caroline Baumann on her wedding day. She wore an elegant silveresque dress she'd ordered from a Brooklyn designer. She exchanged her vows at a lush Hamptons preserve inside one of her favorite sculptures, a dome designed by R. Buckminster Fuller. She put photos of the day on Instagram.
That joyous event may have cost Ms. Baumann her job.
Ms. Baumann was forced to resign as director of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in Manhattan last week following an investigation by the Smithsonian's inspector general into potential problems regarding the procurement of the dress and the wedding space.
Her resignation was made public on Feb. 7, without explanation of the reason. Two people with knowledge of the Smithsonian's decision making, but who declined to be identified because the organization was not publicly commenting on the matter, said that the investigation had turned up evidence of an appearance of a conflict of interest.
The ousting of Ms. Baumann has angered members of the Cooper Hewitt board, which is separate from the Smithsonian leadership. Several board members said they were considering resigning because they disagreed with the decision and were not consulted in advance. A number of the board members have donated substantial sums to the museum in recent years, and their departure could affect its finances.
"I know the circumstances of the investigation that led to Caroline's dismissal and I must say I am appalled that this was its conclusion," Judy Francis Zankel, a prominent philanthropist who serves as the secretary of the board, wrote in an email to Lonnie G. Bunch III, the Smithsonian's secretary and top official. "I have been working with her long enough to know without a doubt that she has been unfairly accused and unjustly judged."
Even board members who acknowledged Ms. Baumann may have violated policy said they believed the punishment was too harsh.
It was unclear whether there were additional reasons for Ms. Baumann's forced resignation, and a Smithsonian spokeswoman, Linda St. Thomas, declined to discuss specifics. "We're transparent about a lot of things," she said, "but not personnel."
Ms. Baumann, 53, declined to be interviewed. She had been with the museum since 2001, having previously worked at the Museum of Modern Art, and was named director in 2013.
Despite its turn-of-the-century housing, an imposing Fifth Avenue mansion built for Andrew Carnegie, the museum is renowned as a repository of forward-thinking design in an array of fields, including art, architecture, graphics, electronics and products.
Several trustees said Ms. Baumann had been transformational for the Cooper Hewitt, overseeing its $ 91 million renovation, raising the museum's profile and attracting donations.
The investigation into her conduct was triggered by an unidentified staff member's complaint, and focused on her September 2018 wedding to John Stewart Malcolmson, a branding and graphic design consultant. (The wedding was featured in the regular "Mini-Vows" section of The New York Times.)
One issue was the dress Ms. Baumann commissioned from a young Brooklyn designer, Samantha Sleeper. Ms. Sleeper said in an interview with The New York Times that she provided the inspector general with emails showing that she had charged -- and Ms. Baumann had paid -- $ 750 for a cocktail dress. But since the designer's website says that "custom gowns begin at $ 3,000," that price discrepancy raised eyebrows at the inspector general's office, which sent agents to speak with Ms. Sleeper.
According to Ms. Sleeper, the agents suggested that Ms. Baumann had offered to use her stature as the head of Cooper Hewitt to wrangle a discount, perhaps by offering to promote Ms. Sleeper's work. Ms. Sleeper said she responded that she had given Ms. Baumann an appropriate price, since the dress was a sleeveless sheath and not a wedding gown. She said that she told the agents that she was not seeking publicity, as she had already been featured in major magazines.
"It was a super simple silhouette with no freelancers working on it besides me," Ms. Sleeper told the The Times. "I did not give her a discount nor did she ask for a discount. She asked the price of the dress, I sent her an email and she paid me that amount."
It is not clear what the inspector general concluded about the dress, but another focus of its investigation was the location of the wedding, the LongHouse Reserve in East Hampton. The reserve, a 16-acre property with carefully tended gardens and outdoor sculptures, is run by a nonprofit founded by Jack Lenor Larsen, a prominent textile designer who lives on the property and is a friend of Ms. Baumann. (In 2015, the Cooper Hewitt awarded Mr. Larsen one of its annual national design awards.)
Mr. Larsen welcomed Ms. Baumann's use of the property for the ceremony (the reception was held on Shelter Island) and did not charge her. According to the people familiar with the Smithsonian's decision, it took issue with the fact that Ms. Baumann allowed Mr. Larsen's nonprofit to hold its board meetings at no cost in a conference room at the Cooper Hewitt.
"How can it be inappropriate for a nonprofit to use a conference room for a board meeting?" said Matko Tomicic, the executive director of LongHouse. But the Smithsonian was apparently concerned about the appearance that favors had been exchanged and believed that Ms. Baumann should have reported the free use of the reserve as a gift.
The Smithsonian is not a federal agency, but it was created by Congress and is partly funded by the government. In accordance with its charter, its board of regents comprises three members each from the House and Senate, the vice president, the chief justice and members of the public.
In many ways, it behaves like an appendage of the government, and has a conflict of interest policy that mimics those of many public agencies: "Employees must not engage in private or personal activities that might conflict, or appear to conflict, with Smithsonian interests, such as using Smithsonian employment for private gain" or "giving preferential treatment to any person or company for any reason."
Like many federal departments, it also has an independent inspector general. But Ms. Sleeper said that she was troubled by the behavior of the agents who interviewed her. A few weeks later, she sent an email to the inspector general's office saying that the agents sounded biased against Ms. Baumann and predisposed to find fault.
She said one of the agents told Ms. Sleeper that he had heard that Ms. Baumann was "a 'Devil Wears Prada' type" and that she "was a bitch."
"I found this statement to be astronomically shocking and inappropriate coming from a man who was representing a federal investigation whose purpose was to be in a place of inquiry," Ms. Sleeper said in her email. "I expressed my opinion that it's not a respectful or appropriate way to speak about women, and that I don't think it's appropriate to be repeating that term to me." She wrote that the agent responded that he "didn't need a lecture."
Epin Hu Christensen, a counsel to the inspector general's office, said the office could not comment on the substance of its investigations. "As a general matter," she said in an email, "we adhere to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency's Quality Standards for Investigations."
Part of the Cooper Hewitt board's displeasure stems from the unorthodox structure of the Smithsonian, which oversees 19 museums and galleries and the National Zoo, almost all located in the Washington area. The Cooper Hewitt board oversees the day-to-day operations of the museum and contributes significant funds, but it technically has only an advisory role.
The share of Cooper Hewitt's budget that comes from the government is about half that received by the Smithsonian's other museums. It is the only one to charge admission, and it relies heavily on donations, including gifts from its board.
In 2014, for example, the museum received a $ 10 million donation from the family foundation of the longtime board member Barbara Mandel. And the interior designer Agnes C. Bourne, a current vice president of the board, donated $ 2 million toward the museum's 1996 renovation. Ms. Bourne commended Ms. Baumann's leadership, adding, "I can't imagine anything she would do that would be a problem."
Another board member, the author Kurt Andersen, said that Ms. Baumann "has done an extraordinary job, overseeing a great renovation and expansion and reinvigoration of the museum."
"If her alleged infractions are what I understand them to be, the punishment seems crazily disproportionate," he added. "I really hope they'll reconsider."

Texto completo: One reader calls his objection to the president's tweets a "Kabuki theater act feigning dismay." Another urges the attorney general to resign.
To the Editor:
Re "Barr Says Attacks From Trump Make Work 'Impossible"' (front page, Feb. 14):
Attorney General William Barr would have us believe that among the tens of thousands of criminal cases prosecuted annually in the United States, his reaching down to modify the sentencing recommendations in only one case, that of the president's friend Roger Stone, is a normal part of his job and not a corrupt favor to Mr. Trump.
His Kabuki theater act feigning dismay over the president's tweets criticizing the Justice Department is more likely a clever feint to divert attention away from his own malfeasance than an expression of real dismay over Mr. Trump's behavior.
Carl Mezoff
Stamford, Conn.
To the Editor:
Attorney General William Barr has been a bit slower than most of us to understand who Donald Trump is. But now he has apparently caught on: Mr. Trump, he says, is making it "impossible for me to do my job." So does Mr. Barr have the integrity to resign, as some other Justice Department officials have done? Or will he remain in office, collecting a paycheck for the duties he says he cannot perform?

Texto completo: Our interview with the woman defending Harvey Weinstein.
We asked Megan Twohey, one of the investigative reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein story in 2017, to tell us what it was like to interview Donna Rotunno, Weinstein's lawyer, for last Friday's episode :
When we reached out to Donna Rotunno in late January seeking an interview for "The Daily," it was a matter of fairness. We had already devoted two episodes of the podcast to explaining the criminal prosecution of Harvey Weinstein and the perspectives of his accusers. Now we wanted to hear from his top defense lawyer, the person representing his side of the case.
But the criminal trial was already underway. Would Rotunno have time to break away and meet with us?
Somewhat to our surprise, the prompt answer was yes. And on Jan. 28, shortly after court was adjourned for the day, Rotunno showed up in an audio studio at The Times, eager to talk.
There were so many questions I wanted to ask. As a cub reporter, I had covered the Chicago area courthouses where Rotunno began her career as a young prosecutor. Rotunno had created a professional niche representing men accused of sexual misconduct. I had spent years reporting on sex crimes before breaking, with my colleague Jodi Kantor, the story of Weinstein's alleged sexual harassment and abuse.
During the interview, I drew on my reporting background to question some of her claims. When Rotunno said that the criminal justice system favored alleged victims over the accused, I told her my investigations had turned up evidence of the opposite -- that all too often, victims had been ignored or mistreated by the police and prosecutors while perpetrators escaped punishment. When Rotunno suggested it was naive of women to agree to meet men in hotel rooms and not expect sexual advances, I pointed out that in the case of Weinstein, the producer often conducted business in hotel rooms, and many of his alleged victims were instructed to go there for official work meetings.
But it was one of my last questions, which I had almost forgotten to ask, that created the most tension: Had Rotunno ever been sexually assaulted?
"I have not," she said. "Because I would never put myself in that position."
In the exchanges that followed, Rotunno argued that victims of sexual assault should take equal responsibility for what happened to them, as I kept pushing her to clarify her position.
Judging by the outpouring of comments on social media and in emails that we received after the interview aired Feb. 7, listeners had strong reactions to what they heard. Some listeners said they valued hearing Rotunno's perspective. But many expressed outrage at what they saw as the lawyer's victim-blaming. Under the hashtag #WhereIPutMyself, victims of sexual assault have been sharing the settings in which they were attacked, rebuking the notion that they were in any way responsible for what happened to them.
The interview also caused a stir in court. When the prosecutor complained that Rotunno had violated the judge's order that they not discuss the Weinstein case publicly during the trial, Rotunno claimed that the "Daily" episode had been recorded "a long time ago," that she had not spoken to any reporters since the start of the trial and that she had no idea when the episode would air.
That was not the case, and a spokesperson for The Times had to confirm to media outlets that the interview was in fact recorded on Jan. 28, during the trial, and that Rotunno was made aware of the airdate.
On Thursday, Rotunno rested her defense of Weinstein. The prosecution will rest its case today. And the jury is scheduled to begin deliberations on Tuesday.
Talk to Megan on Twitter: @mega2e .
Two weeks in quarantine
In Thursday's episode , we heard from Amy Qin, a reporter who has been covering the coronavirus epidemic in China. Last week, she was evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. She sent us an update:
When I boarded the final cargo flight arranged by the U.S. State Department to evacuate American citizens from Wuhan, I had no idea where we were going, let alone what to expect.
It felt like crossing into a parallel reality to land in sunny California, at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. Here, we were told, was where we would be spending our next two weeks in a government-mandated quarantine.
Not long after we arrived, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a town hall-style meeting on the lawn to address the group's concerns. There are 232 evacuees from Wuhan on the Miramar base. Some had arrived on earlier flights, and I could feel them eyeing newcomers warily, wondering who was potentially carrying the virus.
Two of us, we've since learned.
I made the decision to spend as much time indoors as possible. Those of us without families are staying in what they call the "Consolidated Bachelor Quarters," a two-story complex of small suites with kitchenettes. We each have our own suite.
I've spent most of the past week in the suite, working on my laptop. I buy groceries and microwavable meals online, which are delivered to my door by the incredibly kind and generous staff. I also got a travel yoga mat, which I spend more time thinking about than actually working out on.
The few times I've ventured outdoors, I've worn a face mask. Wearing one isn't required on the base, but most people do. After seven years of living in smoggy Beijing, I'm used to it.
Today marks my eighth day in quarantine. Six more days to go.
The number of times I've had my temperature taken since I left Wuhan: 19.
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: "If this app were made publicly available, it would be the end of being anonymous in public." Kashmir Hill investigates Clearview AI, the little-known company behind a facial recognition app that law enforcement is already using.
Tuesday: Will the results of the Iowa caucuses impact voters in other early states? On an episode of "The Field," Lisa Lerer travels to New Hampshire to ask.
Wednesday: Alex Burns breaks down the results of the New Hampshire primary and what they mean for the rest of the race.
Thursday: "This is one of the few times I've heard raw anger toward the government publicly." Amy Qin on how the coronavirus epidemic in China is testing the state's social contract with the people.
Friday: The post-acquittal presidency: Peter Baker looks at President Trump's purge of impeachment witnesses and protection of allies after his victory in the Senate trial.

Texto completo: American negotiators had insisted on a decline in hostilities -- though not a complete cease-fire -- before signing an agreement with the Taliban.
MUNICH -- American officials said on Friday they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable. If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Trump is scheduled to travel to India. That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Esper met on Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president. But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart. Mr. Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is highly specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the American-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Mr. Trump. One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan -- though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the C.I.A.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down. But it is the closest they have come to President Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the American troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict. In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; United States officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place. It calls for a complete withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban -- something the Taliban has long refused -- on a long-term power-sharing settlement. Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.
In September, American and Taliban negotiators were close to an agreement, and Mr. Trump planned to meet Taliban leaders in person, before he dropped the deal because of a Taliban attack.

Texto completo: The decision to decline charges appears to be a move to distance the Justice Department from President Trump, who has long attacked Mr. McCabe.
WASHINGTON -- Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director and a frequent target of President Trump's, will not face charges in an investigation into whether he lied to investigators about a media leak, his defense team said on Friday.
The decision by prosecutors in Washington ends a case that had left Mr. McCabe in legal limbo for nearly two years. It also appears to be a sign that Attorney General William P. Barr wants to show that the Justice Department is independent from the president: The notification came a day after Mr. Barr publicly challenged Mr. Trump to stop attacking law enforcement officials on Twitter and said the criticisms were making his job more difficult.
The prosecutors informed Mr. McCabe's lawyers of their decision by phone on Friday morning, the lawyers, Michael R. Bromwich and David Schertler, said in a statement.
"We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought," they said. "We are pleased that Andrew McCabe and his family can go on with their lives without this cloud hanging over them."
The president's relentless criticism of the Justice Department probably complicated the prosecution of Mr. McCabe. His supporters viewed the investigation as politically motivated and inextricably tainted by Mr. Trump's relentless attacks.
The lack of charges is likely to anger the president, who has long believed he was targeted illegally by Mr. McCabe and other former senior F.B.I. officials who opened the investigation in 2016 into whether his campaign conspired with Russia's election interference operation.
Mr. Trump has most recently attacked the Justice Department and prosecutors for asking for a stiff prison sentence against Roger J. Stone Jr., the president's longtime friend and former adviser.
The investigation into Mr. McCabe grew out of findings from the Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz. He faulted Mr. McCabe in 2018 for misleading investigators when asked about the disclosure of information in 2016 to a Wall Street Journal reporter about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
Mr. Horowitz referred his findings to prosecutors in Washington, who investigated Mr. McCabe, presenting evidence to a grand jury.
Mr. McCabe's lawyers have vigorously denied that he intentionally lied to Mr. Horowitz's investigators. In a bid to convince law enforcement officials that they had no case, Mr. McCabe's lawyers met in August with the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, and the former United States attorney for the District of Columbia, Jessie K. Liu, whose prosecutors handled the case.
In September, the grand jury was recalled after going months without meeting but left the courthouse without revealing any signs of an impending indictment. The next day, Justice Department officials told Mr. McCabe's lawyers that they had rejected the last-ditch appeal to not charge him.
Hints of the case's weakness had emerged. One prosecutor assigned to the case recently left, an unusual step so close to a potential indictment. Another departed for a private law firm and has expressed reservations about how the case was handled.
A key witness testified that Mr. McCabe had no motive to lie because he was authorized as the F.B.I.'s deputy director to speak to the news media, so he would not have had to hide any discussions with reporters. Another important witness testified he could not immediately remember how the leak unfolded. Both would have been crucial to any prosecution.
Additionally, people who are charged with lying to the F.B.I. are typically accused of committing the offense in the course of a criminal investigation, not an administrative inquiry. For example, Mr. Horowitz determined last year that a senior Justice Department official committed wrongdoing by viewing pornography on his work computers and then providing false statements to investigators, but prosecutors declined to bring charges.
Mr. McCabe's lawyers made the case to Mr. Rosen that other former officials were not prosecuted after they were caught lying to the inspector general's investigators.
Mr. McCabe has been a consistent foil for Mr. Trump, who repeatedly attacked Mr. McCabe's wife, Jill, over her failed 2015 campaign for the Virginia Senate, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by a longtime ally of the Clintons.
Mr. Trump seized on her campaign as proof that Mr. McCabe wanted to take him down while protecting Hillary Clinton, whom the F.B.I. had investigated for her use of a private email server. Mr. McCabe said on Friday that he was glad the investigation was over but feared Mr. Trump would never let up. "I don't think I'll ever be free of this president and his maniacal rage that he's directed at me and my wife," Mr. McCabe said on CNN. For more than two years, he said, Mr. Trump "for absolutely no reason whatsoever" has been "lying about us and defaming me and my family."
When the president dismissed James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, he said it was in part for his decision to allow Mr. McCabe to be involved in the Clinton investigation, according to excerpts from a draft letter from the president to Mr. Comey that were read to The New York Times.
"Few events have represented a more profound breach of public trust than your decision to allow the Clinton email investigation to be overseen by deputy F.B.I. director Andrew McCabe, whose wife Jill McCabe received approximately $ 700,000 in campaign donations steered to her by a top Clinton surrogate," Mr. Trump wrote. "McCabe should not have been allowed to work on this matter."
Mr. Trump's aides intervened and sent Mr. Comey a more toned-down letter explaining his dismissal.
But little evidence bears out the president's view of Mr. McCabe. He oversaw the Clinton investigation as the bureau's deputy director only after Mrs. McCabe lost her race, and the Wall Street Journal article about Mrs. Clinton late in the presidential campaign was more damaging to her than helpful.
In the months after the inspector general report, the president pushed for the firing of Mr. McCabe. "F.B.I. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits," Mr. Trump tweeted in December 2017. "90 days to go?!!!"
Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, dismissed Mr. McCabe hours before he was eligible for those benefits, a move many saw as vindictive. It was also a possible conflict of interest because Mr. McCabe had opened an investigation into Mr. Sessions after receiving a criminal referral from Congress suggesting that he had lied to lawmakers about his contacts with a Russian diplomat. The case was later closed.
Mr. McCabe spent 21 years in the F.B.I., beginning his career in New York investigating Russian organized crime. When terrorists struck the twin towers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. McCabe deployed as a bureau SWAT team member. He later oversaw major international terrorism investigations and rose to run the bureau's national security division and its Washington field office. He was promoted to deputy director in January 2016 after the Clinton email investigation was underway.
After Mr. Comey was fired, Mr. McCabe took over the F.B.I. as acting director during a period of intense turmoil at the top of the bureau. The F.B.I. began investigating whether Mr. Comey's firing constituted obstruction of justice and opened a counterintelligence inquiry to determine whether Mr. Trump was being directed by Russia.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the investigation, concluding that he had insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Trump or any of his associates with secretly conspiring with the Russians. Mr. Mueller also declined to say whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, citing Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents, but laid out evidence of attempts by the president to impede the inquiry.
Rancor between the president and Mr. McCabe only grew after the publication of his book, "The Threat," in which he accused Mr. Trump of terrorizing his family and punishing him for the Russia investigation.
"He went after me because the F.B.I. opened the Russia case, which led to the appointment of the special counsel," Mr. McCabe wrote. Mr. Mueller's investigation raised "questions about the legitimacy of his presence in the White House -- questions that prompt fear" in Mr. Trump.

What Went Wrong in Iowa? We Checked the Math

Texto completo: Since the troubled Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, the state Democratic Party has revised the results for about 100 of the state's 1,765 precincts, and officials are still scrambling to verify dozens more precinct results after reports of widespread inconsistencies.
There has often been some fuzziness in the way the results of the Iowa caucuses were calculated and reported. But this is the first year that Iowa Democrats released raw vote counts. The transparency provided the public with its first opportunity to check the complex math that determines which candidates get the delegates they need to win the Democratic nomination.
And in many cases, the math did not check out. In such a close race -- Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is leading Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by a tenth of a percentage point -- even small mistakes can add up.
Here are some of the inconsistencies and errors The New York Times uncovered in an analysis of the Iowa Democratic Party's results.
Recorded vote totals do not add up: 79 precincts
WHAT'S WRONG The Iowa caucuses happen over two rounds of voting. People may leave after the first round, but there should not be more people voting in the final round than in the first.
In more than 600 precincts, the vote totals did not match perfectly, and in 79 the final-round votes were higher.
WHAT IT MEANS When the totals don't match up, it is difficult to determine which count is accurate.
The first count helps determine whether a candidate meets the viability threshold -- a set share of total caucus attendance -- and which candidates move on to the final round. The final count determines who wins delegates. If either of these counts is inaccurate, the results could be inaccurate, too.
An app designed to record caucus results would have flagged this discrepancy, a Times review of the app's source code shows. But many people were unable to use the app or chose not to.
Delegates awarded improperly: 21 precincts
WHAT'S WRONG Each precinct sends a set number of delegates -- real people chosen by caucus attendees -- to a county convention, where each delegate casts a vote for one candidate based on the outcome of the caucus.
Only candidates who meet the viability threshold should win county delegates, but this wasn't always the case this year.
WHAT IT MEANS In 21 precincts, candidates who did not earn enough support to win any delegates appear to have won them anyway.
In the example at right, from a precinct in Black Hawk County, the minimum votes required for viability was six. There were only five in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s group, but he still received one delegate.
Caucusgoers who initially chose Mr. Biden should have had to make another choice, or persuade a member of another group to join them. But since they did not, it's impossible to know which candidate they might have chosen or how those choices would have changed the results.
Too many delegates awarded: 8 precincts
WHAT'S WRONG In a handful of cases, precincts awarded more delegates than they were supposed to. This precinct in Webster County had three delegates to send to the county convention but awarded delegates to four candidates.
WHAT IT MEANS Since Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders were tied in the final alignment but both were viable, it should have come down to a coin toss over whose supporters should move to another viable candidate. Support for one of these candidates is overstated in the final results, but we can't know which.
In a handful of other cases, precincts awarded fewer delegates than they were supposed to, understating support for at least some of the candidates there.
Delegates calculated improperly: At least 28 precincts
WHAT'S WRONG The rules for calculating delegates are complicated and not always intuitive. There are additional rules for ties, and contests can come down to a coin toss. In this example from Dubuque County, because of errors in the delegate calculations, Mr. Buttigieg was awarded a delegate that should have gone to Mr. Biden.
WHAT IT MEANS These kinds of miscalculations are easy to make. The caucus math worksheet, which caucus volunteers use to record votes, does not offer instructions for every scenario, and volunteers must consult a handbook for advice on the less common ones. Moreover, the handbook does not appear to cover every potential situation, and delegates could mistakenly be awarded to the wrong candidates.
The Times checked the delegate math in more than 1,200 precincts. The vast majority of these appeared to follow the rules. But at least 28 precincts appear to have gotten it wrong, with consequences for the candidates. (About 500 precincts had some inconsistency or complication that precluded a check for delegate calculation errors.)
Steve Drahozal, the Democratic Party chairman for Dubuque County, confirmed that the 36th Precinct appeared to have made a mistake in its delegate math.
Mr. Drahozal said he was alerted on Sunday to errors in one other precinct in Dubuque County where delegates were awarded improperly. "I know with 100 percent certainty that was a good-faith mistake," he said.
He had not reached out to the state party about the error, assuming officials there would contact him instead. As of Thursday afternoon, he'd heard nothing.
Data entry mistakes: At least 100 precincts
WHAT'S WRONG When the reporting app failed on caucus night, the state party was flooded with calls from volunteers trying to submit their results. The people taking the calls had to copy down the results and enter the data by hand, leaving plenty of room for error.
In this example, in Indianola's Second Precinct in Warren County, the party released results showing that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Sanders had zero votes in the first round but picked up several dozen each in the final round, a highly unlikely scenario. Meanwhile, the billionaire Tom Steyer and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts met the viability threshold in the first round but lost all of their votes in the final round.
The precinct's worksheet shows vote counts that make more sense. It appears that whoever entered the data into the party's database switched the votes for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders with those for Mr. Steyer and Mr. Patrick.
WHAT IT MEANS There is no way to know how many of these errors occurred without a full recanvass of every precinct worksheet. The party had to revise results for dozens of precincts in an early release of results because of a transposition error.
The party agreed last week to review 92 precincts at the request of the campaigns and county chairs. On Sunday, it issued corrections to 54 of them -- including Indianola's Second -- to bring its reported results in line with what was written on precinct worksheets.
But if the worksheets showed any mistakes in counting votes or calculating delegates, the party did not correct them. The party said the worksheets were legal documents and could not be revised.
"We do not believe that we should be altering the official record of what happened in the room," Troy Price, the party chairman, said Monday at a news conference. On Wednesday, Mr. Price resigned.
The Sanders and Buttigieg campaigns have requested a further review of some precincts. If the campaigns decide the problems are enough to shift the race, they could request a recount.
Aaron Krolik contributed reporting. Methodology: The Times analyzed the most recent caucus results released by the Iowa Democratic Party on Feb. 9. The party's data has not always been reliable, and the party has already made corrections to about 100 precincts where its reported results did not match the data from precincts' caucus math worksheets. The party is still reviewing precincts at the request of the campaigns. The party did not make the caucus math worksheets available. The Times used the party's caucus guide, training materials and interviews with county chairs for guidance on caucus rules. We did not examine satellite caucuses or caucuses with only one county delegate to award because they follow different rules. The number of votes needed for viability for each precinct was calculated based on total votes in the first round. The county delegates awarded to each candidate were calculated from the Iowa Democratic Party's list of delegates allotted to each precinct and the state delegate equivalents reported in the official results. The part of our analysis looking at delegate math was conducted on a subset of precincts for which the first and final round votes were consistent. That analysis did not include situations where a tiebreaker may have been necessary to award delegates. Sources: Caucus results come from the Iowa Democratic Party. Caucus chairs and county chairs provided additional information about local results. Precinct locations are from the Voting and Election Science Team.

Texto completo: A Manhattan investigation had led to charges against Etienne Uzac, who co-owned IBT Media, and another media executive.
The Manhattan district attorney's office seized 18 computer servers from the headquarters of Newsweek magazine in Lower Manhattan on Jan. 18, 2018. On Friday, the raid yielded guilty pleas to fraud and money-laundering charges from two publishing executives in Manhattan Criminal Court.
Etienne Uzac, a former co-owner of IBT Media, the onetime owner of Newsweek, and William Anderson, a former chief executive of Christian Media, both pleaded guilty to one count of each charge, said the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
The pleas followed a yearslong investigation of ties between IBT Media and David Jang, a South Korean pastor, and Olivet University, a small Bible college he founded in Southern California.
Mr. Vance and a team of investigators working under him, including members of the Major Economics Crimes Bureau, uncovered misrepresentations of Newsweek's finances that included a fictitious accounting firm called Karen Smith L.L.P., prosecutors said. Money ostensibly borrowed for office equipment was used for other purposes, according to the charges.
Journalists at Newsweek, including two top editors and a reporter, were fired in 2018 after they looked into IBT Media's financial dealings and legal troubles in the weeks after the raid. Several others resigned. The district attorney's office filed criminal charges against Mr. Uzac and Mr. Anderson in October 2018, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud and money-laundering conspiracy.
The charges also named IBT Media, which bought Newsweek from IAC/InterActive in 2013. IBT Media pleaded guilty on Tuesday and agreed to forfeit $ 30,000.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Vance called the crime "a massive fraud scheme through which a group of sophisticated criminals illegally moved tens of millions through our Manhattan marketplace by brazenly overstating the financial health of their companies."
An attorney for IBT Media and Mr. Uzac, Marc Agnifilo, said in a statement on Friday, "IBT Media is pleased to close this matter and looks forward to continue to grow the business." He added, "We agreed to a resolution that does not involve jail and allows Mr. Uzac and all defendants the ability to put this chapter behind them."
An attorney for Mr. Anderson did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Newsweek was founded in 1933 as a newsweekly to rival Henry Luce's Time. In 1961, it was bought by The Washington Post Company. At its peak 30 years later, it had a circulation of more than 3.3 million. As late as 2007, it had 10 international bureaus.
In 2010, The Washington Post Company offloaded it -- for $ 1 -- to the billionaire investor Sidney Harman, who also assumed $ 40 million in liabilities. He merged it with The Daily Beast, the IAC web publication. Newsweek was sold to IBT Media for an undisclosed price.
The sentencing trial for Mr. Uzac and Mr. Anderson is scheduled for April 20.

Texto completo: FRANKFURT, Germany - So far, only scattered cases of the coronavirus have appeared in Europe, but the economic effects are proving harder to quarantine. The shock may be severe enough to push the vulnerable German economy, and perhaps the entire eurozone, into a recession.
That is the conclusion of a growing number of economists as it becomes clear that it will take weeks, at best, before the Chinese economy resumes its role as a prolific exporter of essential factory goods, and as an increasingly important consumer market for the rest of the world.
"The longer it takes for production to resume, the higher the risks," said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
For the chief executive of Daimler, one of Germany's most prominent companies with several auto plants in China, the crisis is one of uncertainty.
"I'm calling China every day," Ola Källenius said at a news conference in Stuttgart. "It's too early to say if and how other factories could be affected. We are talking about global networks."
The rest of the world could also suffer economically, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, warned lawmakers this week.
"We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell told House Financial Services Committee members.
The problems of German automakers' reverberate around the continent, because so many small and midsize parts suppliers in countries depend on them for sales. Italy's economy shrank in the fourth quarter in part because its industrial north is closely linked to Germany.
"For most countries, Germany is the most important trading partner," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. "If it starts to slow down, other countries will feel it."
Daimler and other carmakers were forced to keep their factories in China closed longer than planned after the Lunar New Year holiday, and the virus has kept people out of showrooms. On Monday, the company said it had begun gradually ramping up production.
But the situation remains tense and unpredictable. There is widespread concern that assembly lines around the world could be forced to shut down for lack of components made in China.
China has become a critical market for all German carmakers. Daimler sold nearly 700,000 Mercedes-Benz cars in China last year, more than twice as many as it sold in the United States.
Smaller companies are also affected. Many have factories in China that have been idle or operating far below capacity.
Ziehl-Abegg, a German maker of industrial fans, has a factory in Shanghai with 450 workers who produce air-circulation systems for hospitals, among other things. The high-performance fans have been in demand during the crisis.
Nevertheless, Chinese authorities allowed only a skeleton crew on the site last week to fill orders from newly built hospitals in Wuhan, Shandong and Shenzhen, said Rainer Grill, a Ziehl-Abegg spokesman.
Even after the Shanghai factory was allowed to reopen this week, fewer than half of the employees reported to work. They were under orders to stay home because they had visited affected areas of China during the Lunar New Year.
German machinery-makers like Ziehl-Abegg are coming off a terrible year and can hardly afford any more problems. New orders for products like machine tools or construction machinery slumped 9% in 2019 because of President Donald Trump's trade war, Brexit and auto industry woes.

US, Taliban take a step toward peace with truce Sides view 7-day cut in violence as a key test in Afghanistan

Texto completo: MUNICH - U.S. officials said Friday that they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war.
The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there.
The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are defending American policies.
But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed.
The timing is notable.
If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to India.
That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement.
A truce has been widely expected, and Pompeo and Esper met Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president.
But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart.
Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others.
The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire.
The violence reduction deal, the official said, is specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the U.S.-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks.
The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Trump.
One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan - though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence.
The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the CIA.
The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises.
All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down.
But it is the closest they have come to Trump's goals of withdrawing many of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States' longest war.
The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes.
A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict.
In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks.
The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; U.S. officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place.
The deal calls for a complete American withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes "complete withdrawal."
It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban - something the Taliban has long refused - on a long-term power-sharing settlement.
Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States' acceding to the Taliban's demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued.

Rihanna's line accused of deceptive marketing

Texto completo: When singer Rihanna started a lingerie collection in 2018, she teamed up with the startup behind Kate Hudson's athleisure line Fabletics.
But Fabletics and the startup TechStyle Fashion Group faced complaints about deceptive billing tactics, and now Rihanna's line, Savage x Fenty, is now facing the same criticism.
The line has been praised for using models of different body types and ethnicities in its marketing. But on Tuesday, Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization, said Savage x Fenty "ensnares consumers into unwanted monthly charges" through a membership plan that was difficult to opt out of. It said it had alerted the Federal Trade Commission to the line's business practices, which it believes violate the agency's rules and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.
When consumers buy items like bras and underwear from the Savage x Fenty website, the brand allegedly enrolls consumers in $50 monthly subscriptions "without disclosing all the material terms and conditions of the offer," Truth in Advertising said. The prices that appear when an item is added to a shopper's online cart - say, $19.50 for a pair of leggings - require a membership. For nonmembers, the price of the leggings would more than double. Truth in Advertising added that the brand also used "dissuasion and diversion tactics" when consumers tried to cancel memberships.
Savage x Fenty denied the claims. "These accusations are false and based on misconceptions of our business," Emma Tully, a representative for the line, said in an email.
"At Savage x Fenty, we believe strongly in transparency, which is why we provide multiple disclosures of membership terms throughout the shopping experience, within advertisements and through our ambassador engagement policies," she said.
The complaint from Truth in Advertising involves the pervasiveness of so-called negative-option billing online, which refers to the practice of companies charging consumers for a service unless it is specifically declined.
"A lot of consumers really love the fact that this brand is championing female empowerment and inclusiveness, and so they are very willing to purchase products from this website," Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth in Advertising, said. "What they don't understand is that the prices they're seeing on social media are prices for joining a membership, and because of the way the checkout process works, they are unwittingly being put into a subscription model."
When customers add items from the site to a shopping cart, a "Savage x Monthly Membership" is automatically added. To check out, customers have to proactively remove it, which may cause the price of items to rise sharply.
TechStyle has raised more than $500 million in funding and is valued at about $1 billion, according to Pitchbook, a data provider. The startup, formerly known as JustFab, and its founders have specialized in these types of subscriptions for years.

The 'radical middle' is an elusive thing Guest Columnist

Texto completo: My favorite rendering by the nonpareil cartoonist Julius Feiffer depicts a circa 1960s radio show host interviewing a spokesman for "the radical middle."
Asked to explain his views, the guest responds, "The radical middle thinks it's time we took the initiative in world affairs, while deploring the idea of change for change's sake. We oppose concessions to the Soviets. However, we favor negotiations and strongly support the U.N. We favor arms control and a continued buildup, a strong civil rights program without the undue haste which creates deep scars."
When the show's host urges the guest to sum up his philosophy, the latter fires back: "Bold times call for bold answers, within reason, in a manner of speaking. More or less."
Which brings us to the battle underway for the Democratic presidential nomination: a classic quandary only months from determining whether the current occupant remains in the White House for another four years. The choice seems to hinge on the question of whether a progressive or a moderate has a better chance of attracting sufficient undecided voters to defeat President Donald Trump.
Democrats are torn between candidates espousing sweeping social change - single-payer universal health insurance, forgiveness of college debt, free higher education - such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or others offering little more than a post-Trump reversion to some semblance of normality, like Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar.
At virtually every critical juncture in United States history, the electorate rejects back-tracking to the way things were in favor of risking the unknowable. As Justice OIiver Wendell Holmes wrote in his legendary Abrams dissent: "Every year, if not every day, we wager our salvation on some prophecy based on imperfect knowledge."
In 1860, with Civil War looming as a probable consequence, the nation elected anti-slavery President Abraham Lincoln.
In 1932, amid the Great Depression, voters chose Franklin D. Roosevelt over the opposition's fear that his New Deal programs would usher in the apocalypse.
Democrats of all stripes today regard Trump's reelection bid as yet another precarious epochal crossroads.
Their dilemma is reflected in The New York Times' refusal to take sides in what its editorial board acknowledges is a battle for the party's soul. The Times staked out its own middle ground by pronouncing Klobuchar as the best moderate presidential candidate and Warren as its preferred progressive hopeful.
"May the best woman win," the Old Gray Lady's non-endorsement editorial concluded.
No discussion of revolutionary centrism can overlook the fluidity of the middle, exemplified by the presidential candidacy of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
His very existence on the campaign trail - a gay Afghanistan war veteran and mayor of the fourth largest city in the 38th largest state - belies the notion that he represents the same old, same old in American politics.
Mayor Pete favors diminishing the probability of a conservative-leaning Supreme Court for a generation or more by increasing its membership. Never mind that, despite the aforementioned Roosevelt's overwhelming popularity, the electorate drew the line at the latter's similar effort to pack the Court. Buttigieg also calls for terminating the constitutionally mandated electoral college, the rigid anachronism that has given us two recent presidents - George W. Bush and Trump - who lost the popular vote.
When a presidential candidate seeking to overturn two 200-year precedents, one requiring a Constitutional amendment, is labeled as moderate - which Buttigieg has been - those viewing "radical middle" and "extreme moderate" as cheeky satire need to think again.

Art Laboe's got you covered. Still.
It seems impossible to have grown up in Southern California and not know Art Laboe, even if it might take a moment to place the name. That's how it is sometimes, with radio personalities.
The radio DJ is believed to be the first to take song requests to deliver from one to another and can you believe he coined the phrase "Oldies but Goodies"? Laboe, 94, was born when radio was only a few years old and he's spent more than 70 years in the industry.
As he heads to San Diego this weekend to host the Art Laboe Valentines Super Love Jam, enjoy this profile on the longtime voice still crooning out dedications after all these years.
Cheap love, expensive homes and rich people
Love don't cost a thang, and neither should your night out — or at least, it needn't break the bank. We've got suggestions.
Quintessential California love stories, in 100 words (my story is one of them!).
It took nearly two decades to get a mega-development approved and built in the Ventura Harbor. At last, the first residents have moved in (story is for subscribers only).
Guessing California's richest person may not be too hard. But can you guess who's No. 2? Answer's at the bottom.
Get your dogs vaccinated
Now would be a good time to check your pets' vaccination records. State officials are warning about the spread of canine distemper among wild animals that carry the potentially fatal virus.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife warned this week of an “unusually high” increase in cases among those that carry it, including skunks, foxes and raccoons.
Similar to the common cold, canine distemper can be transmitted through inhalation of respiratory droplets or saliva, and occasionally through other bodily fluids. If wild animals get into pets’ food and water bowls, the virus can be transmitted.
Unvaccinated dogs can also transmit the disease to other animals, though humans can't catch the disease.
Porcupine Creek and other interesting reads
The intriguing story of Porcupine Creek, which will host a big-ticket campaign fundraiser for President Donald Trump on Wednesday, less than two weeks before California's Super Tuesday primary election. But even before Trump's visit, the property owned by Larry Ellison had cemented its place in the Coachella Valley's "Presidents' Playground" folklore. Check out the story for how the estate got its interesting name.
A third of plant and animal species could be gone in 50 years, new research has found.
A man is killed after he falls into a piece of equipment at a mushroom growing, picking and packaging plant in Monterey County.
Democratic presidential candidates talk Native American issues
Perhaps more than ever before, presidential candidates are addressing issues of significance and importance to a group historically ignored or given scant attention: Native Americans.
Democratic challengers to President Trump have published lengthy tribal issues position papers, detailing their positions on sovereignty-related court cases and pinpointed how their broader platforms will affect the country's nearly 6 million Native Americans. And candidates for the first time participated in Native American presidential forums.
The Desert Sun reached out to all the Republican and Democratic candidates with questions about their platforms regarding Native American issues and reviewed the position papers candidates had published online.
The candidates tackled issues include missing and murdered indigenous women, Standing Rock, housing, health services and WiFi.
Here's what they had to say and where they stand. And here's what they said about:
California's housing crisis.
How to confront wildfires.
The state's fast-growing aging population.
Whether the state should set its own emissions standards.
As for Trump, he angered many when days into his presidency he approved the completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, which Native Americans and others opposed because it threatened water quality for the community and ran through land sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
He also declared November to, along with Native American History Month, be National American History and Founders Month.
And here's your answer to California's richest:
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg edged out Oracle's Larry Ellison. See who tops the other 49 states when it comes to the moola.
That's it for this week.
Enjoy Valentine's Day, no matter how you spend it, and enjoy a long weekend if you've got it! I'll see you on Tuesday.

Trump administration taps elite Border Patrol units to arrest immigrants inside the United States

Texto completo: The Trump administration said Friday that it is preparing to deploy elite Border Patrol tactical units to the interior of the United States to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement teams in “sanctuary cities” and other jurisdictions where authorities are seeking to boost arrests and deportations.
The deployment, which will send 100 agents from Border Patrol’s highly trained BORTAC teams to embed with ICE agents, comes as the Trump administration has threatened to retaliate against states and jurisdictions that eschew cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Immigration officials said the Border Patrol tactical agents will assist in routine operations and would be deployed to sanctuary jurisdictions as well as other areas where the agency needs help.
In a statement, ICE acting Director Matthew Albence said the BORTAC agents would help alleviate “resource challenges” produced by sanctuary policies.
“As we have noted for years, in jurisdictions where we are not allowed to assume custody of aliens from jails, our officers are forced to make at-large arrests of criminal aliens who have been released into communities,” said Albence. “This effort requires a significant amount of additional time and resources.”
The Border Patrol agents working with ICE will have the authority to make arrests, but immigration agents will direct the operations, officials said. Tactical agents working along the border are typically involved in operations targeting criminal suspects, smugglers, stash houses and other enforcement targets with elevated risks of violence.
One official with knowledge of the plans said the BORTAC agents were being sent to help ICE less for their quasi-military training than for the fact that their units are intended to be flexible and are not anchored to a specific Border Patrol sector or region.
The deployment was first reported Friday by The New York Times. [The Times report said Houston was one of the cities where units would be sent.]
Heather Swift, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the 100 agents would include other U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel, not just tactical units.
“The CBP agents and officers who are being detailed to help ICE come from a number of different sectors and job positions,” Swift said.
ICE has 5,300 enforcement officers nationwide, and Swift said the number of immigrants with “non-detained” cases living in the interior of the United States has surpassed 3.2 million. “ICE does not have sufficient resources to effectively manage the sustained increase in non-detained cases which is exacerbated by the rise of sanctuary jurisdictions,” she said in a statement.
A DHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said similar proposals have been under consideration before, as recently as last year, with a broader scope enlisting other federal agencies such as the FBI to assist with immigration enforcement.
The White House budget proposal released Monday also sought more than $500 million to hire thousands of additional ICE agents.
During the peak of the migration crisis at the U.S. southern border last year, ICE sent 350 immigration agents to help CBP cope with a historic influx of children and families crossing the border and seeking asylum.
Arrests at the border have dropped 75% since last May, amid increased enforcement in Mexico and at the southern border, freeing the Trump administration to redirect its enforcement efforts to the U.S. interior.
Trump had campaigned on promises to swiftly deport immigrants from the interior of the United States, but the border crisis and the increasing resistance of sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit ICE’s access to immigrants in their jails, have impeded his efforts.
ICE arrested 143,000 immigrants last year inside the United States, a 10% drop and the lowest number since Trump took office. Arrests of convicted criminals also fell 12%, to approximately 92,000.
Advocacy groups accused the Trump administration Friday of reassigning the tactical agents to the interior of the United States to frighten immigrants and “rile up” his base this election year. The announcement comes after Attorney General William P. Barr said Monday that the Justice Department would sue two so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions in New Jersey and Washington state.
Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said she feared the ramp-up is part of a “broad pattern of reprisal” against sanctuary jurisdictions. She warned that tactical teams accustomed to remote border regions could put citizens and immigrants at risk while working in unfamiliar, congested cities.
“We shouldn’t have SWAT-like teams participating in immigration enforcement across the country,” she said.
“The desire to terrorize immigrants, that is the point, ” said Lorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action, an advocacy group. “It’s no surprise that it comes at a time when the election season is well underway.”

The Agony of the Democrats; Bernie Sanders is riding the intellectual currents that the party and its elites have nurtured.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders's victory in New Hampshire on top of his tie in Iowa makes him a favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Hard to believe, but in a winnable race against President Trump the opposition may nominate a socialist who wants the government to control energy production and health care, who wants nationwide rent control, and who calls America a "racist society from top to bottom." No wonder Democrats like James Carville are in agony.
The Vermont revolutionary's victory portends a long primary battle, unless Democratic voters elevate a single mainstream candidate who can challenge him. Mr. Sanders will get his 25% to 30% primary after primary, racking up delegates on his way to the convention. If other candidates keep dividing the other votes, he will be hard to stop, as Mr. Trump was for Republicans in 2016. Even if a single alternative emerges, Mr. Sanders won't go down without a ferocious intra-party fight.
***
How did this happen? How did Mr. Sanders move from the socialist fringe to the brink of controlling the Democratic Party? The Senator's dogged persistence across decades and especially the last four years is part of the explanation.
Yet Mr. Sanders wouldn't be this close to the White House if not for the complicity of Democrats and the liberals who dominate the academy and media. Rather than fighting the ideas that animate him and his millennial voters, they have indulged and promoted them. They created the political environment in which he could prosper. Consider the intellectual currents he is riding:
• The attack on capitalism and markets. Like Tony Blair in Britain, Bill Clinton's New Democrats accommodated the economic lessons of Ronald Reagan. By the Obama Presidency, all that had changed. The left blamed markets for the 2008 panic and crash—not failed government regulation, subsidies for bad housing risks, or too loose monetary policy.
Then came the socialist intellectual comeback led by French economists Thomas Piketty ("Capital"), Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Inequality replaced growth as the top economic policy concern. The economists resurrected the anti-market ideas and tax policies of the 1930s, and they were celebrated by the Democratic press. Occupy Wall Street became the street version of this movement and was praised by no less than Barack Obama.
It's a short ideological hop from there to 60% marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, the demonization of billionaires, and equating business success with "corruption," as Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren do. Millennials heard Democrats assail "the rich" for years, but Bernie has the courage of their pretensions.
• The rise of left-wing intolerance on campus. From the late 1960s on, the political left flooded into the academy and rewrote the curriculum to fit its ideological fashions. American history was dogmatized, often according to the work of Howard Zinn. The Western canon was purged. Conservatives resisted but lost as liberals accommodated the revolution.
First the humanities, then the social sciences and now even the sciences have been forced to bend to identity politics. Race, gender, class and sexual orientation became preoccupations in scholarship and tenure. This is the academic culture that nurtured millennials and Gen Z to believe in microaggressions and the "cancel culture" that now torments Democrats who disagree.
• The critique of America as irredeemably racist. Identity politics took an especially sharp turn on race with the police shootings of 2014 and 2015. Black Lives Matter erupted and demanded that politicians bow to its concerns. No Democrat has dared to challenge it, or to defend 50 years of racial progress or the reduction in crime that has saved black lives.
Author Ta-Nehisi Coates became the darling of white liberals with his castigation of America as systemically racist. The New York Times has tried to replace 1776 with the 1619 arrival of the first slaves to North America as a racist America's founding event.
• Climate change as religion, not science. A generation of apocalyptic climate education has made what was a matter of temperatures and scientific modeling into a cultural identity. No dissent is tolerated, and the solutions must be radical and immediate. Mr. Sanders was quick to sense the political possibility and grab onto the Green New Deal.
***
These are among the beliefs feeding the radicalism and resentment of the Sanders campaign. Bernie started his political career as a Marxist focusing on the economic class struggle. But he has adapted to these other intellectual streams, and this year he has adopted identity politics with a fervor that out-woked Julián Castro and Kamala Harris.
Yet rather than challenge Mr. Sanders, the other candidates have given him a pass on everything besides Medicare for All. They have adopted his tax and redistribution arguments, if not all his policies. They mimic his denunciations of America as racist.
With the exception of Joe Biden, they have also accepted his anti-interventionist foreign policy. The press corps has almost seemed to cheer Mr. Biden's collapse in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet now the Democratic media find themselves fearing that Mr. Sanders might win the nomination and lose to Mr. Trump. Their refusal to challenge the political left makes them Bernie's accomplices.
The tragedy is that this year, even more than most years, the country needs a sensible and centrist opposition party and nominee. Millions of Americans like the results of Mr. Trump's policies but not his divisive brand of politics and personal behavior. They are looking for an alternative who doesn't scare them. The agony of the Democrats is that years of bowing to the left means they may nominate someone who makes Mr. Trump look like the safer choice.

Rihanna's lingerie line accused of deceptive marketing

Texto completo: When Rihanna started a lingerie collection in 2018, she teamed up with the startup behind Kate Hudson's athleisure line Fabletics.
But Fabletics and the startup TechStyle Fashion Group faced complaints about deceptive billing tactics, and now Rihanna's line, Savage x Fenty, is facing some of the same criticism.
The line has been praised for using models of different body types and ethnicities in its marketing. But this week, Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization, said that Savage x Fenty "ensnares consumers into unwanted monthly charges" through a membership plan that was difficult to opt out of. It said it had alerted the Federal Trade Commission to the line's business practices, which it believes violate the agency's rules and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.
When consumers buy items like bras and underwear from the Savage x Fenty website, the brand allegedly enrolls consumers in $50 monthly subscriptions ' without disclosing all the material terms and conditions of the offer," Truth in Advertising said. The prices that appear when an item is added to a shopper's online cart - say, $19.50 for a pair of leggings - require a membership. For nonmembers, the price of the leggings would more than double. Truth in Advertising added that the brand also usee "dissuasion and diversion tactics' when consumers tried to cancel memberships.
The group also said ihat ads for the line from social media influencers could be deceptive.
Savage x Fenty denied the claims. "These accusations are false ant based on misconceptions of our business," Emma Tully, a representative for the lire, s aid in an email.
"At Savage x Ferny, ws believe strongly in transparency, wh_ch is why we provide multiple disclosure s of membership terms throughout the shopping exp an ence, within advertisements, andthroLgh cur ambassador engagement policies " she said.
The complaint from Truth in Advertising involves the pervasiveness of so-called negative-option billing online which refers to the practice of companies charging consumers for a service unless iris specifically declined.
"A lot of consumers really leve the fact that this brand is championing female empowerment and inclusiveness, and so they are very willing to purchase products from this website," Tonn e Patten, the executive director of Tr eth in Advertising, said in an interview. "Whar they don't understand is that the prices theyTe seeing on social media are prices for joining a membership, and because oi "he way the checkout process works, ihev are unwittingly being put into a subscription model."
When customers add irems from the site to a shopping cart, a "Savage x Monthly Membership" is automatically added. To check out, customers have to proactively remove it, which may cause the price of items to rise sharply.
TechStyle has raised more than $500 million in funding and is valued at about $1 billion, according to Pitchbook, a data provider. The startup, formerly known as JustFab, and its founders have specialized in these types of subscriptions for ye ars.
In 2014, Adam Goldenberg, the company's co-founder, was named in a complaint against Sensa, a company he led that sold a bogus miracle weight-loss powder. The FTC fined Sensa nearly $50 million, one of the biggest it had ever given for deceptive advertising.
TechStyle paid $1.88 million the same year to settle a consumer protection lawsuit that claimed that its brands, including Fabletics, failed to "clearly and conspicuously" explain that its discounts required automatic monthly subscription fees.
Still, TecnStyle has been viewed as a Silicon Valley success and is expected to eventually conduct an initial public offering.
Consumers may be aware of the Savage x Fenty business model, but Patten said that Truth in Advertising had tracked hundreds of complaints around the company's billing and cancellation practices.

Texto completo: Paula Kelly, a tall, lithesome dancer who was one of the first African American women to make a successful transition to movies and television from Broadway, using the musical "Sweet Charity" as the bridge, died Saturday at a nursing facility in Whittier, California. She was 77.
Her niece, Dina McCarthy, said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Kelly burst into the movies in 1969 in "Sweet Charity," an adaptation of the stage musical about an ever-hopeful taxi dancer - a dance partner for hire - in a rundown Times Square dance hall. Kelly played the dancer Helene, one of two best friends of the title character, Charity Hope Valentine, played by Shirley MacLaine. Chita Rivera played the other.
Although lesser known than the movie's big stars - Sammy Davis Jr. also had top billing - Kelly more than held her own, especially in the seductive number "Big Spender" and the energetic "There's Got to Be Something Better Than This," in which the three dance-hall girls express their determination to get respectable jobs.
Onstage, Kelly played Helene in the London production of "Sweet Charity" (with music by Cy Coleman, lyrics by Dorothy Fields and a book by Neil Simon). The director, Bob Fosse, who also directed and choreographed the show on Broadway, asked Kelly to reprise the role for the movie, which was to be his feature-film directorial debut.
He called her "the best dancer I've ever seen."
Her performance in "Sweet Charity" landed her other acting roles in movies, among them the science-fic:ion thrillers "The Andromeda Strain" (1971) and "Soylent Creen" (1973). It also led to multiple parts on television shows including the dramas "Hill Street Blues" and "Policewoman" and the sitcoms "The Golden Girls" and "Night Court," in which she played a public defender, winning an Emmy Award nomination in 1984.
Kelly earned another Emmy nomination for playing one of television's first Black lesbian characters, in the 1989 ABC miniseries "The Women of Brewster Place." Adapted by Oprah Winfrey's production company from a novel by Gloria Naylor, the miniseries, also featuring Winfrey and Cicely Tyson, was praised for showcasing the complexities of the lives of Black women living in a tenement building. Kelly's character, Theresa, lived in the building with her partner, Lorraine, played by Lonette McKee.
Despite her many acting roles, Kelly's first love was dance.

Texto completo: A revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams, directed by Robert O'Hara (who recently staged "Slave Play" on Broadway) and starring Audra McDonald, Carla Gug no and Bobby Cannavale, will open the Williamstown Theater Festival's season this summer.
The season, announced Monday, will also include four new plays and a new musical, along with a new production of the Anna Ziegler p ay "Photograph 51." It will run from June 30 through Aug, 23 in Williamstown, Massachusetts.
"I think when you look at contemporary work by living playwrights, especially alongside some of the great canonical writers and their work, you're really looking at the American experience in both directions," Mandy Greenfield, the festival's artistic director, said in a phone interview. "You're looking at who we were at a moment in time, and you're looking at who we will be, who we can be, who we are currently."
That should be especially pronounced during the summer of an election year.
In addition to "Streetcar," which will run through July 19 and cast McDonald as Blanche DuBois, the Main Stage will host "Cult of Love," a dark comedy from Leslye Headland, a creator of the Netflix series "Russian Doll." The play had a brief run at a small theater in Los Angeles in 2018, but hasn't been seen elsewhere. This production will be directed by Trip Cullman; its cast will include Kate Burton ("Grey's Anatomy") and Taylor Schilling ("Orange Is the New Black"). The story centers on a family grappling with differences in religious, political and sexual identity while at home for the holidays. ( Greenfield called it a "family drama for our moment.") It runs July 22 through Aug. 2.

Joe Rogan endorsement is mixed blessing for Sanders

Texto completo: "Can Democrats win back Trump voters - without compromising their soul?"
That's the question asked by the left-progressive weekly The Nation. But I have a better one: Can Bernie Sanders win foe Rogan's audience without losing his dignity?
As you might have heard by now, the presidential candidate and democratic socialist senator from Vermont has won the widely coveted - and also widely reviled - endorsement of Joe Rogan, the actor-comedian who also ranks No. 1 on Forbes' inaugural list of the highest-earning podcasters.
Rogan, the former host of "Fear Factor" - a TV contest show in which he coaxed contestants to eat bugs, among other stunts, for money - made $30 million last year. Yes, there is life after television.
Rogan voiced support for Sanders during a Jan. 21 podcast episode featuring New York Times opinion columnist Bari Weiss after interviewing Sanders on an earlier episode: "I think I'll probably vote for Bernie.... I believe in him, I like him a lot."
And the news of Rogan's endorsement came just before a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week that, for the first time, found Sanders had inched ahead of the pack to be top choice of Democratic voters nationally. His 27% essentially tied Joe Biden, who scored 26% after weeks of having occupied the top spot by himself in previous Journal/NBC polls.
But after the Sanders campaign happily shared the video of Rogan's comments on social media, the progressive-wing candidate was bombarded with, of all things, complaints from a high-class assortment of the left-progressive voices who did not approve.
MoveOn.org, for example, said Sanders should apologize for highlighting Rogan's endorsement. The Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBTQ rights organization, said it was "disappointing" that Sanders had "accepted and promoted the endorsement."
Writer Donna Minkowitz spoke for many, I'm sure, in an essay in The Nation headlined, "Bernie Broke My Heart When He Embraced Rogan's Endorsement" and "I've been a lifelong socialist and a supporter of Sanders since the 1980s. I expected better from the senator."
I understand. On his freewheeling talkathon, Rogan has used the N-word, if only to chastise someone else for using it. He infamously described how visiting a Black neighborhood to see "Planet of the Apes" made him feel like he, too, was visiting the "planet of the apes."
He also occasionally has given a platform to far-out conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones and provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos. Although, as my son - who stays in tune with the morning-zoo sectors of the internet better than I do - pointed out, Rogan did the world a favor. He was the interviewer who drew out the pedophile-tolerant quotes of former Breitbart editor Yiannopoulos that sunk his invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, among other lucrative speaking gigs.
Rogan was accused in 2013 of making transphobic comments about UFC fighter Fallon Fox, a trans woman, who was criticized for beating two women in matches before announcing that she used to be a man. Rogan was hardly the only voice to criticize the shaky ethics of Fox's move.
But, before we roll out the tumbrels to cart Sanders off to cancel-culture jail, consider the provocative question raised later in The Nation by Chicago-based podcaster Edward Burmila: "Beating Trump is the goal. What if Joe Rogan fans will help?"
Burmila, described as working on a book about "why the Democrats are so bad at politics," says much of value, but to me this line stuck out: "Elections and politics are about winning power, and it requires selective memory to pretend that winning the White House in 2008 and 2012, or the House in 2018, did not require swallowing hard on a lot of compromises aimed at courting conservatives."
True that. I'm not the world's biggest Sanders fan. His insistence on eliminating private insurance companies in his "Medicare for All" vision is too far left for me. But politics should be a game of addition, not subtraction. Before Donald Trump came along, it usually was.
By focusing so narrowly, Trump offers Democrats a gift: a vast multitude of swing voters and disaffected nonvoters who are looking to be persuaded by a reasonable alternative. At least, Sanders is trying to fill that gap. He shouldn't be alone.

Nunes foe McClatchy files for bankruptcy

Texto completo: The owner of the biggest newspapers in California's Central Valley and dozens of other newspapers across the country is filing for bankruptcy protection.
But McClatchy Co.'s 30 newsrooms, including the Sacramento Bee, Modesto Bee, Merced Sun-Star and Fresno Bee in the Valley, will continue to operate as usual as the publisher reorganizes under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, company officials say.
"The Fresno Bee is operating as usual today. We remain fully focused on producing independent local journalism that serves the central San Joaquin Valley," said Joseph Kieta, Fresno Bee's executive editor. "Nothing about the news today changes our focus or mission. We appreciate the continued support of our readers and our community."
McClatchy also owns the Tribune in San Luis Obispo, The Miami Herald, Kansas City Star, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
The company hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection in a few months as a private company, with majority ownership by a hedge fund that's currently McClatchy's largest shareholder and debtholder, Chatham Asset Management. That would end 163 years of family control.
McClatchy's financial woes come during a difficult time overall for the newspaper industry. The estimated total U.S. daily newspaper circulation including both print and digital in 2018 fell 8% from the prior year to 28.6 million for weekday. Sunday circulation fell 9% to 30.8 million, according to the Pew Research Center for Journalism and Media.
Last year, New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet bleakly predicted the demise of "most local newspapers in America" within five years, except for ones bought by billionaires.
The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, both national publications, are thriving after being bought by billionaires. The Boston Globe, Minneapolis Star-Tribune and Las Vegas Review-Journal are among other major American newspapers that appear to have steadied themselves after being sold to local wealthy individuals.
Legal battles with politicians McClatchy's bankruptcy news also comes in the middle of a contentious $150 million legal battle with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), who sued the newspaper publisher in 2019 when the Fresno Bee published a story about a lawsuit surrounding an alleged drug-fueled sex party held on a yacht in the San Francisco Bay.
The newspaper reported a representative from a winery in which the congressman is a limited partner was on board.
Nunes argued the story unfairly hurt his reputation in an effort to torpedo his 2018 re-election campaign, which he easily won.
"Defendants' statements were knowingly false and grossly offensive," the lawsuit stated. "They evince a heedless, palpable and reckless disregard for the truth."
Nunes did not return messages to comment about McClatchy's bankruptcy, but he did share a social media post calling the financial maneuver "good."
"Newspaper giant McClatchy Co. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Good. Guess all those Fusion GPS generated stories didn't pay off in the end eh? This should be a lesson for newspapers that are willing to be used as propaganda outlets for Fusion GPS."
Fusion GPS is the firm first hired by GOP opponents to dig up dirt on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. After Trump secured the nomination, the Democrat National Committee and Clinton campaign hired Fusion GPS to continue the research.
Earlier this week, a Virginia judge delayed a ruling on a request by McClatchy lawyers to dismiss the Nunes lawsuit. The judge said she would make her ruling sometime in April or May.
Long history, murky future McClatchy's origins date to 1857 when it first began publishing a four-page paper in Sacramento, California, following the California Gold Rush. That paper became The Sacramento Bee.
The family-owned McClatchy, considered a regional player, vaulted into one of the biggest newspaper publishers in 2006 when it took over Knight Ridder, a larger competitor, for $4.5 billion in cash and stock and another $2 billion of Knight Ridder debt.
The deal was a disaster, made worse by 2007's Great Recession and changes in media consumption. McClatchy has suffered as readers give up traditional subscriptions and get news online, and like other publishers, it's tried to follow them there.
In 2005 before the takeover deal, McClatchy stock was $740 a share. Today, with McClatchy still reeling from the debt it took on to buy Knight Ridder, shares are worth 75 cents.
With the bankruptcy move, McClatchy has received $50 million debtor-in-possession financing from Encina Business Credit. That, combined with normal operating cash flows, will provide enough cash for the company, still based in Sacramento, to continue to function.
McClatchy did not announce any layoffs and tried to reassure employees, saying that while "we are always looking at opportunities to improve operational efficiencies," the Chapter 11 process is "not geared around cost take-outs."
"When local media suffers in the face of industry challenges, communities suffer: polarization grows, civic connections fray and borrowing costs rise for local governments," CEO Craig Forman said. "We are moving with speed and focus to benefit all our stakeholders and our communities."
Digital-only subscriptions have increased by almost 50% year over year, McClatchy said, and subscriptions are now roughly evenly balanced between total audience and advertising revenues, with digital accounting for 40% of those revenues and growing. The company has more than 200,000 digital-only subscribers and over 500,000 paid digital customer relationships.
"McClatchy remains a strong operating company with an enduring commitment to independent journalism that spans five generations of my family," said Chairman Kevin McClatchy, the great-great-grandson of the company founder, James McClatchy.
Layoffs, cost-cutting The company has also worked on its financials, trimming operating expenses by $186.9 million for the three-year period ended in December. It's also paid off about $153.5 million in debt in the same period.
McClatchy expects fourth-quarter revenues of $183.9 million, down 14% from a year earlier. Its 2019 revenue is anticipated to be down 12.1% from the previous year. That would mean that the publisher's revenue will have slid for six consecutive years.
The company expects to pull its listing from the New York Stock Exchange as a publicly-traded company and go private.
McClatchy filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Its restructuring plan needs approval from its secured lenders, bondholders and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
Forman said McClatchy doesn't anticipate any adverse impact on qualified pension benefits for substantially all of the plan's participants and beneficiaries.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week from Washington, a third place finish for Klobuchar in New Hampshire, former congressional candidate Clay Aiken picks a new candidate for president, and the Chair of the Iowa Democratic Party resigns. Let’s get on with this.
The surge is real
In December, one prominent Iowa state legislator declared: “The surge is real.” But now, just over a week after a fifth place finish in Iowa for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, there is a surge. It’s just in New Hampshire. Sen. Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary. And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg got second place.
But Klobuchar’s success was well beyond most people and poll’s expectations. She sailed past both Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, earning a third place spot. Her fundraising is on an uptick as well: after Friday’s debate last week, she raised $3 million. After polls closed in New Hampshire, another $2.5 million.
“Thank you, New Hampshire,” she said closing out her rally, the night of the primary. “We are on to Nevada, because the best is yet to come.”

Schriock on the DFL

Stephanie Schriock is the President of Emily’s List, the largest political action committee supporting pro-choice Democratic female candidates for office. This year, the organization plans to spend $20 million of 500 state legislative races around the country, including in Minnesota. On Thursday, they announced several endorsements: Rita Albrecht (SD-5), Sara Flick (SD-25), Bonnie Westlin (SD-34), Ann Johnson Stewart (SD-44), Lindsey Port (SD-56), Amanda Matchett (HD-37B), Kelsey Waits (HD-54B).
I spoke to Schriock about her roots working in DFL politics, being trained to work on a Minnesota congressional campaign by Emily’s List, and a bit about her time in Mankato. You can read more at MinnPost.
Here’s a bit from the interview:
Emily’s List was there fighting for Betty McCollum in her first election. We’ve been with Angie Craig every step of the way. We endorsed Amy Klobuchar for U.S. Senate, even over another woman, which was not an easy thing for us to do. And we’re on the phone with Tina Smith getting her to say yes, which I’m so grateful for. And, and so I just feel like the Emily’s List and Minnesota story is tied together and it goes all the way into the legislature and it’s going to continue for a long time.
A bill becomes a law?
Rep. Angie Craig will soon have a bill on President Donald Trump’s desk — the first bill in the current Congress sponsored by a member of the Minnesota delegation to make it anywhere near being signed into law. The bill, The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, aims to curb billions of dollars of improper payments made by federal agencies to government contractors.
Craig told me it fits in a much larger portfolio of bills she’s working on that aim to increase public trust in government.
“I literally had a former member of Congress come pull me off the House floor once to try to get me to meet with his clients after I’d turned down the meeting,” Craig said.
“And you know, that kind of crap, is what makes my constituents not have faith in this place.”

By the numbers
* 58,796: The number of votes cast for Amy Klobuchar in New Hampshire, more than twice the amount of votes cast for either Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden.
* 50 : The number of staff a Klobuchar staffer says the campaign has in Nevada.
* 9 : The number of days until the Nevada Caucus.
The president next door
Clay Aiken wants you to vote for Sen. Amy Klobuchar . In an op-ed for USA Today, the early 2000s American Idol runner-up says: “It was difficult for me to move my support from Joe Biden. But Amy Klobuchar is simply a better candidate for the 2020 race against Donald Trump.”
Klobuchar has had several memorable exchanges this week. For example, after being booed at an event in New Hampshire, when she took the stage, Klobuchar exclaimed: “Hi, Bernie people!”
There’s also this exchange with The View’s Sunny Hostin, who told Klobuchar that the Myon Burrel case was botched: “It gives me no pleasure to say this because as you know, I was a prosecutor as well … it is one of the most flawed investigations & prosecutions that I think I have ever seen.”
On a similar note, as people are digging up candidate’s past statements and actions as they relate to black Americans, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in the spotlight this week for comments he made in 2015: “People say ‘Oh my god, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true … because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods … because that’s where all the crime is.”
Bloomberg is also trying to “move past” his legacy with stop and frisk, saying he’s disavowed the practice. But his entire tenure as mayor reflected differently.
Finally, one Nevada poll. In this recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of 500 likely voters, Biden maintains a lead within the margin of error. The poll was taken before Yang dropped out.
* Joe Biden: 19%
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 18%
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 11%
* Tom Steyer: 8%
* Pete Buttigieg: 8%
* Andrew Yang: 4%
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 4%
* Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: 1%
In other news
* Rep. Ilhan Omar unveiled the Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), a package of seven bills aimed at reorienting U.S. foreign policy.
* Nobody can explain why a meeting of the entire Minnesota Legislature is closed to the public. Read more from MinnPost.
* After problems with the Iowa Caucus, the head of the Iowa Democratic Party will resign.

Texto completo: SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, plans to open a Maine facility to hold people suspected of immigration violations, according to an email obtained by the Bangor Daily News.
ICE would share the industrial building in Scarborough at 40 Manson Libby Road with a marketing firm and a federal veterans health agency that has signed a lease to relocate there. ICE's use of the building was referred to in a December email obtained late Thursday under the Freedom of Information Act.
"[T]his space will be lowkey and not brightly advertised as an ICE location," Alisha Wofford, a leasing specialist with the U.S. General Services Administration, said in an email to other government officials. GSA is an agency that builds, manages and leases real estate for the federal government.
The email was heavily redacted, but the full version said ICE authorities will process, fingerprint and detain people suspected of immigration violations there. People apprehended by ICE agents could be kept in onsite holding rooms for hours but would be transported in unmarked vans to an overnight detention facility elsewhere, if necessary, according to the email.
A source who requested anonymity for fear of retribution provided the unredacted email to the BDN in which Wofford described the holding facility as similar to a "police station" -- not a "jail." Wofford said it would not have steel bars. It was not clear when it was expected to begin operating.
She added that ICE's operations are not expected to "trigger any of the visiting veterans" who would come to the neighboring health agency for treatment.
"You should not have to worry about ICE having any negative impact on the vet center," she told health agency staff in her Dec. 3 email.
The news comes four months after ICE faced protests following an announcement that it would open an administrative office in Portland's Monument Square. ICE has no other holding facilities in Maine. The nearest Enforcement and Removal Operations field office is in Boston, according to the agency's website.
The facility also comes as ICE has arrested more people nationwide. The agency said it apprehended more than 1.1 million people in 2019, an increase of more than 68 percent from the previous fiscal year.
ICE did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the number of people apprehended in Maine during that time. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the facility.
The Scarborough industrial building is owned by Maine Realty Advisors. Principal Josh Soley said that his firm offered the space for the government's use by bidding on a contract from the Department of Homeland Security via an online system. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which was seeking leasable space in New England.
He said that he told tenants in the building that a Department of Homeland Security agency could locate operations there.
Maine Realty Advisors owns real estate and manages properties throughout the state. It announced in January it would be converting a 200-year-old former monastery in Portland into low-income housing for asylum see kers.
Immigration enforcement has ramped up under the Trump administration.
The New York Times reported Friday afternoon that federal ICE agents who typically confront border smugglers are being redeployed to cities across the country known for immigrant-friendly policies. These "sanctuary" cities have largely refused to cooperate with federal authorities who are targeting immigrants for deportation. Portland is not a sanctuary city.
Some say there's evidence that federal authorities have targeted Portland, where local law enforcement is expected to cooperate with ICE despite an ordinance that prohibits city workers from asking the immigration status of individuals who are seeking city services.
Those who work in Portland's social service circles blame a policy change they say was designed to intentionally overwhelm networks in liberal cities that offer aid and assistance to immigrants. These policies could be setting up a "release-and-catch" system where Portland is inundated with improperly processed immigrants who then become easy targets for deportation.
Since June of last year, the city of Portland found housing for more than 800 asylum seekers -- most of them fleeing violent persecution from Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- who sought emergency shelter for more than nine weeks in the gym of the Portland Exposition Building.
Maine's recent influx of migrant families -- who came here legally to seek asylum -- first began to arrive in Portland from San Antonio, Texas with little warning last summer. In an effort to reduce dependence on taxpayer money, the city has relied on private donations and social service organizations for volunteer services to aid them.

What is a Second Amendment sanctuary? Conoy Twp. is drafting a resolution to become one.

Texto completo: On Thursday night, Conoy Township supervisors in Northwest Lancaster County voted 3-1 to have the township's solicitor draft a resolution to become a "Second Amendment sanctuary." So what does that mean, and what is the potential impact?
What is a Second Amendment sanctuary?
A Second Amendment sanctuary occurs when a governmental body - municipal, county, state - passes an ordinance expressing support of the Second Amendment and pledges not to comply with proposals or legislation that is seen as a violation of constitutional rights, such as bans of certain models of guns, like assault weapons, or through so-called "red flag" laws.
These red flag laws, called "extreme risk protection orders," have been passed in 17 states and proposed in Pennsylvania to allow law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from someone in danger to themselves or others by court-order in response to mass shootings.
Gov. Tom Wolf again mentioned his support of passing one of these laws in the commonwealth during his budget proposal last week, which Conoy Township supervisor's chair Stephen Mohr said was his motivation to make the municipality a Second Amendment sanctuary.
These Second Amendment sanctuaries share the same idea as sanctuary cities, which are often cities that pass a resolution directing its local law enforcement to refuse cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The Trump Administration has been trying to crack down on these cities, from trying to block their federal funding and deploying an elite Border Patrol squad to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement make arrests and deportations, the New York Times reported.
Are there other municipalities that have passed resolutions for this?
If Conoy Township passes this resolution, it would be one of the first Second Amendment sanctuaries in the state. Other parts of the state, such as West Manheim Township in York County, are also drafting resolutions. Clinton County declared itself a Second Amendment territory on Jan. 30.
Some municipalities in Virginia passed Second Amendment sanctuary ordinances after the state Legislature passed a red flag law.
Does Conoy Township have legislative support in doing this?
Two Pennsylvania state lawmakers have publicly said they support municipalities that pass these ordinances.
State Rep. Aaron Bernstine, R-Lawrence, wrote a letter to local officials in his district encouraging them to pass their own Second Amendment sanctuary ordinances and therefore "be voting to protect the constitutional rights of thousands of constituents in your municipalities," according to the letter.
Rep. Stephanie Borowicz, R-Clinton, was the first state lawmaker to come out in support of these ordinances, and called on Clinton and Centre counties to become Second Amendment sanctuary counties.
Efforts to reach Rep. David Hickernell, who represents Conoy Township, for comment on whether he supports this area's efforts to become a Second Amendment Sanctuary were unsuccessful.
The leader of Firearms Owners Against Crime, a statewide gun rights advocate, opposes Second Amendment sanctuaries because they might encourage some local governments to pass laws to do the opposite and pass their own local gun restrictions, Kim Stolfer told PA Post.
If Conoy Township becomes a Second Amendment sanctuary, would it have any impact?
Gun-control proposals like red flag bills are highly unlikely to become law in the state's Republican-controlled Legislature.
But if there were gun-control measures approved -- and Conoy Township passes the resolution -- the resolution could possibly be enforced.
This would also require the Susquehanna Regional Police to decide whether it would comply with the Conoy Township ordinance, as this regional police department shares a police force with East Donegal Township and Marietta Borough.

Matt vs. Mitt: Attack of the swamp creatures

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When conservative ringmaster Matt Schlapp officially didn’t invite Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to his annual ultra-right confab — the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) — eye-rolling was suddenly trending.
If little else is transparent in this tiny village where word gets around, Schlapp’s motivations surely are. Rather than simply not inviting Romney, which one does by not inviting him, Schlapp tweeted a photo of the senator looking like a corpse-eating zombie along with the CPAC logo and the words: “Not invited: Mitt Romney.”
Ostensibly, Schlapp was concerned that Romney might be subjected to physical violence at the conference because of his solitary Republican vote to convict Trump on one of two charges, abuse of power, in the impeachment trial. This concern could have remained buried in Schlapp’s furrowed brow but for his apparent determination to say it aloud in the context of a mean-spirited non-invitation.
It’s not for nothing that Schlapp has seen his lobbying and public relations firm, Cove Strategies, win massive earnings in the Trump era. He boasted to The New York Times that lobbying revenues increased from $600,000 in 2015 to more than $1 million in 2017, and that “strategic communications” revenues were even higher. In the swampiest of swamps, “strategic communications” obviously pays.
What’s clear, of course, is that Schlapp was never going to invite Romney to CPAC. Not only has Schlapp been a Donald Trump man since Day One, as he told me back in 2017, but he also sensed at the onset that Trump would win. This is because Schlapp knows the conservative base perhaps better than anyone, as he should.
As for CPAC, Schlapp typically invites only political stars who might make headlines. Sometimes he might include lesser-known politicians eager for the exposure and, who knows, maybe Schlapp’s services.
Proactively snubbing Romney was a win-win for Schlapp that showcased his messaging skills and, inadvertently, revealed his character. When a man is down, by all means kick the daylights out of him. In so doing, Schlapp ingratiated himself to his base, received bounteous media attention, and maybe even earned a little grace for his wife Mercedes “Mercy” Schlapp.
Mercy was White House director of strategic communications until last July when she joined Trump’s reelection campaign. Meanwhile, the past overlap of Schlapp’s CPAC sponsors and his clients — including Comcast, Altria, and the Motion Picture Association of America — has not gone unnoticed by a contingent of critics who refer to the conference as “The Matt and Mercy Show.”
Schlapp knows as well as anyone that Romney is an honorable man and is surely believable when he says his Senate vote was a matter of principle and not, as some have suggested, revenge. (After publicly courting Romney for secretary of state, Trump chose someone else, seemingly to humiliate his at-the-time former critic.) Even if Romney might derive a tiny bit of satisfaction from the fact that his faith-driven principles didn’t allow him to acquit Trump, what does he really get out of being an outlier — other than the respect of liberals who would admire Hannibal Lecter if he feasted on Republicans?
Poor Romney — right as rain, yet nobody can spare an umbrella. As a presidential candidate, people said he was too squeaky clean. Or, he didn’t pass the beer test. When he said during his 2012 presidential campaign that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe, people scoffed.
Who’s scoffing now?
An argument could be made that Schlapp really was concerned about violence, but what kind of show is he directing? At the 2018 CPAC, conservative columnist Mona Charen had to be escorted out of the conference by security when she was booed for scolding Republicans for not condemning Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct. But more likely, such alleged fears were an excuse rather than a reason to justify his tweet.
By essentially encouraging the mob, Schlapp made his bed on the wrong side of conservative principles and, ultimately, of history. Luckily for him, the Romney we both know would probably accept an apology.

Children will achieve as much as we expect of them

Texto completo: "1776" is an assembly of independent voices who uphold our country’s authentic founding virtues and values and challenge those who assert America is forever defined by its past failures, such as slavery.
“‘We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,’” Obama began, quoting the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. “Two hundred twenty-one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America’s improbable experiment in democracy.”
Standing in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Obama argued that despite America’s original sin, the abomination of slavery, he was optimistic that future generations would continue to make progress toward “a more perfect union,” precisely because our nation was founded on the principles enacted in the Constitution in 1789.
Obama’s speech is relevant amid today’s fierce debate as to what to teach young Americans about the nation’s origin story and true birthdate. Like Obama, some posit that it is 1789, the year the Constitution went into effect, establishing the American form of government. Most Americans believe it was 1776, upon the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the enumeration of the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Some historians say it is technically 1507, when a map, known as “America’s Birth Certificate,” first bore the name “America.”
Against this backdrop enters the 1619 Project, an initiative from the New York Times that commemorates “the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery, and aims to reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.”
In addition to convincing New York Times magazine readers that “our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written,” the 1619 Project is making a concerted effort to warp the next generation’s view of America as well. Random House Group has acquired the rights to the 1619 Project and will develop a graphic novel and a series of four publications for young people. The Pulitzer Center has become the project’s education partner. According to its annual report, the Pulitzer Center has provided free reading guides, extension activities, lesson plans, and physical copies of the magazine to hundreds of schools and teachers across all 50 states, who have brought curricular resources to some 3,500 classrooms.
Indeed, some of the poorest school districts in the country, with the lowest performance levels in reading and math, have adopted the 1619 Project as mandatory curriculum for their high school students. In cities such as Chicago, Newark, and Buffalo, with high concentrations of minority students, what will these young minds now be learning?
Central to the thesis of the project is that this nation was founded not as a democracy but as a “slavocracy,” that white racist supremacy is irrevocably intertwined in the country’s DNA, that plantation slave-labor camps were the catalyst for an enduring system of brutal American capitalism, and as Nikole Hannah-Jones, the person who spearheaded the 1619 Project, asserted in this video, that it is “time for this country to pay what is owed.” She explains that reparations, in the form of cash payments, would be due to anyone who can “trace a descendant back to American slavery” and who can “prove that 10 years prior to the discussion of the reparations bill, you actually lived as a black person.”
Since 2010, I have run a network of public charter schools that now educates more than 2,000 predominantly black and Hispanic students in the heart of low-income communities in the South Bronx and Lower East Side of Manhattan. Because of frustration with their zoned schools, parents must enter a random lottery to gain entry to our open enrollment schools.
Although parents themselves have faced structural barriers around race and fear that their children will as well, they know that a great education can make all the difference. They do not believe that their children are doomed to be shackled by the horrors of America’s legacy of slavery. On the contrary, they want our teachers to provide the kind of quality education that equips children with the skills, knowledge, and habits of mind to thrive in America.
That is what is so disturbing and dangerous about the 1619 Project’s aspiration for children: to create in the minds of students and teachers of all races a vision of America that is imbued with a permanent malignancy that is hostile to the dreams of students of color.
It is simply wrong.
As educators, we must reject these tired ideas, which lead to the soft bigotry of low expectations. We do our scholars no favors by treating them as victims because of a group identity or teaching them to become dependent on a government system such as reparations to succeed in their lives.
As Burgess Owens once wrote in the Wall Street Journal: “At the core of the reparation movement is a divisive and demeaning view of both races. It grants to the white race a wicked superiority, treating them as an oppressive people too powerful for black Americans to overcome. It brands blacks as hapless victims devoid of the ability, which every other culture possesses, to assimilate and progress. Neither label is earned.”
Black students growing up in low-income communities are inundated with messages from many adults in their lives that they will be preyed upon because of their race. Rather than reinforce this false idea of powerlessness in the face of a system rigged against them, why not educate young people of color about the forces within their control that are most likely to put them on a path to power and economic success?
For example, in 2014, a team of researchers led by Harvard’s Raj Chetty investigated the intergenerational mobility of more than 40 million children and their parents. What factors led to communities having high rates of economic mobility across generations and others in which few children escape poverty? The Land of Opportunity study they produced found that “the strongest predictors of upward mobility are measures of family structure such as the fraction of single parents in the area.”
A growing body of research underscores the transcendent role that individual decisions about the timing of family formation can play in achieving the American dream. Indeed, a staggering 97% of millennials who followed the “success sequence” (getting at least a high school degree, working full time, and marrying before having any children, in that order) avoided poverty. And “Black Men, Making It in America: The Engines of Economic Success for Black Men in America,” reveals that a number of factors, including education, work, marriage, church participation, military service, and a sense of personal agency, are all highly correlated to black male economic success in America.
Shouldn’t our young people be taught to understand the pathways more likely to have them flourish financially, rather than perpetuate the noxious notion that black children are owed something and that their path to success must be paved by a massive government handout?
It is ironic that Hannah-Jones created opportunity for her children simply by sticking to this middle-class script in her life. In the autobiographic New York Times story, “Choosing a school for my daughter in a segregated city,” and in discussion about busing and desegregation, Hannah-Jones courageously shares the fears that she and her husband had about enrolling 4-year-old Najya in a segregated, low-income school in Brooklyn.
After describing all of the machinations that went into their decision, Hannah-Jones makes a revealing statement: “I also knew that we would be able to make up for Najya anything the school was lacking.”
Consider the confidence and privilege that Hannah-Jones expressed in her and her husband’s ability to ensure their daughter succeeds. No amount of anti-black racism and no amount of poverty or lack of diversity in her daughter’s school could overcome the power of the stable, two-parent home that she and her husband provide.
Ultimately, I know that the black and brown children from the schools I lead are entering a world in which factors related to race, class, and gender will force them to confront extraordinary challenges while simultaneously being exposed to extraordinary opportunities. The question is, what will make the difference in whether these young scholars succumb to challenge or thrive on opportunity; whether they develop a mindset of enslavement or of empowerment?
We cannot deprive young black children, or children of any race, of the knowledge of the series of decisions that Hannah-Jones, millions of black Americans, and I have pursued on our pathway to economic prosperity and the American dream.
Many of us in the black community must preach what we have practiced to achieve our own levels of professional success — and, more importantly, share what we are teaching our children to help them have the greatest likelihood to achieve their chosen path of fulfillment. For many of us, this goes well beyond just having “The Talk” with our black sons about avoiding police brutality.
It also means communicating to our sons and daughters that they have power in their individual choices, and that those decisions can shape their destiny despite structural barriers associated with race, class, and poverty.
As the 1619 Project correctly points out, America’s history will forever be scarred by the horrific stories of chattel enslavement. But where are the empowering stories of progress? What the project completely misses is the peculiar duality of America. As Hendrik Hertzberg and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. wrote in the 1996 New Yorker special edition, Black in America, “For African-Americans, the country of oppression and the country of liberation are the same country.”
In closing his 2008 speech on race, Obama described the path toward a more perfect union:
For the African American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances, for better healthcare and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans: the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who has been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family. And it means taking full responsibility for our own lives — by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe that they can write their own destiny.
Regardless of where the pushpin falls on America’s timeline of discovery, what really matters is its future and the power of black Americans, and all Americans, to shape this shared destiny.

Texto completo: html> "1776" is an assembly of independent voices who uphold our country’s authentic founding virtues and values and challenge those who assert America is forever defined by its past failures, such as slavery.
So as I read the New York Times’s “1619 Project” — a series of essays intended to reframe American history by placing “the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans” at its center — I kept returning to one question: Which episodes from history teach lessons that are most relevant to black children today? This question is not merely of intellectual interest. The CEO of the Chicago Public School system has pledged to send at least 200 copies of the project to every high school in the city.
The essays in the project answer this question in one voice: slavery. Bryan Stevenson argues that slavery is behind the cruelty of our criminal justice system; Jeneen Interlandi says that slavery explains why America lacks universal health care; Matthew Desmond claims that slavery explains the brutality of American capitalism; and so forth.
I support teaching people of all ages about the horrors of slavery. Textbooks that whitewash this history — for example, by portraying slavery as a “side issue” in the Civil War — are a moral embarrassment. But the 1619 Project is not an honest attempt to educate Americans about our history. It is an attempt to weaponize that history to fight ideological wars in the present.
There’s no doubt that slavery is among the most important chapters in the American story. The 1619 Project exaggerates only slightly when it says that “no aspect of the country … has been untouched by” the peculiar institution. Yet by claiming that slavery has touched everything, the project raises a question about its own prejudice: If slavery is linked to every aspect of America, why single out certain institutions and not others?
The project could have argued, for example, that labor market regulation is rooted in slavery because the Black Codes used occupational licensing to keep blacks in menial positions. Or it could have argued that attacks on free speech are rooted in white supremacy by citing the destruction of the black-owned anti-lynching newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech, by a white mob in 1892. Yet these arguments, despite being just as plausible as those offered in the project, would have targeted two progressive-friendly values: market regulation and speech restrictionism. The absence of any such arguments in the project is, at best, suspicious, and at worst, proof of the ideological prejudice at its core.
If the central historical claim made in the 1619 Project is that slavery has touched everything, then the lesson they want readers to learn is that, to quote the project’s director Nikole Hannah-Jones, “anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country.” As popular as this refrain has become, it’s an imperfect analogy at best.
For one thing, DNA, by definition, remains with you for your entire life. To say that white supremacy is in America’s DNA is, therefore, to suggest that it will remain with us forever. As James Oakes, a leading Civil War historian, observed, this attitude leads to “political paralysis.” By ruling out the possibility of progress, it makes nihilism the only logical option. “What do you do,” Oakes asked, “alter your DNA?”
More importantly, to the typical black kid today, how relevant is the idea that racism is in our DNA? Without doubt, a variant of this idea was relevant to intellectuals such as Martin Delany and Frederick Douglass in the 19th century, when the debate over whether blacks should emigrate from America hinged on whether legalized white supremacy would be permanent or temporary. But that debate has long since ended, and blacks born in America are staying put.
So we must ask ourselves: What good does it do to tell a black child in 2019, based on nothing but thoughtless pessimism, that the only country he’ll ever live in will forever reject him?
If we are going to import heavily editorialized essays about black history into the minds of our children, then we should at least arm them with historical lessons that are relevant to the challenges they face today. One such challenge is posed by the widening gap between those with and without a college degree. Accordingly, we might highlight the heroic efforts made by formerly enslaved blacks to become educated: Almost completely illiterate at the end of the Civil War, by 1910 about two-thirds of former slaves could read and write. Observing such efforts — which included forming secret schools, pooling together money to pay teachers’ salaries and, at times, voluntarily forgoing recess and holiday breaks — the national superintendent of schools for the Freedmen’s Bureau remarked: “What other people on earth have ever shown, while in their ignorance, such a passion for education?”
Another challenge we face today is low geographic mobility. As high-income opportunities increasingly concentrate in specific cities, Americans in general, and blacks in particular, are moving less frequently than ever before. In The Complacent Class, economist Tyler Cowen notes that the overall interstate migration rate is down 51% from its 1948-1971 average. This is partly because moving to cities has become so expensive, but as Cowen argues, it also may be because American culture has lost a certain dynamism. In this vein, another episode of history we might highlight is the Great Migration, during which blacks moved en masse to the north, midwest, and west. In 1916, over 90% of American blacks still lived in the south, where opportunities for upward mobility were virtually nonexistent. By 1970, only 53% remained there.
Instead of teaching black children lessons they can use to improve their lives, such as the importance of education and geographic mobility, the 1619 Project seems hellbent on teaching them to see slavery everywhere: in traffic jams, in sugary foods, and, most surprisingly, in Excel spreadsheets. As Desmond puts it, “When a mid-level manager spends an afternoon filling in rows and columns on an Excel spreadsheet, they are repeating business procedures whose roots twist back to slave-labor camps.”
Without a doubt, America would be a very different place, in ways both large and small, if not for slavery. Yet the arguments marshalled in support of this fact too often rely on an intellectual sleight of hand that would be plain to see if applied to any other historical event. For example, the legacy of World War II includes the creation of penicillin. But few would take seriously the argument that antibiotics are “rooted in” violence.
Because arguments about history can seem pedantic, it’s worth pausing to reflect on what’s at stake. Most people can agree that we want to raise the next generation of Americans to be more enlightened than the last, less likely to make assumptions about others based on their race, and more focused on what unites us than what divides us. We want them to be smarter, more productive, more prosperous. In sum, we want them to be less distracted by trivial conflicts and more focused on solving problems of existential importance. Fulfilling these goals will be no simple task, and I do not pretend to have all the answers.
But one thing is certain: If a century from now America has made massive strides in any of these areas, it will not be because we taught our progeny to see the remnants of slavery hiding in the rows and columns of an Excel spreadsheet.
For black Americans in particular, the stakes are equally high. In the history of multi-ethnic societies, it is difficult to find a single example in which a minority group rose from poverty to affluence by pursuing a strategy that focused primarily on nursing historical grievances (however valid), seeking atonement for them, and stigmatizing those within its ranks that advocated an inward-looking strategy. By contrast, history is replete with examples of minority groups, even ones who have suffered routine political repression and violence, rising to affluence by pursuing the opposite strategy: avoiding politics entirely and focusing single-mindedly on entrepreneurship and education.
Rarely does history offer a lesson as unambiguous as this one.

Texto completo: In celebration of Frederick Douglass’s birthday, the Washington Examiner has published a number of special essays on the topics of race, slavery, and the achievement of the United States’s highest ideals. This represents our collaboration with the Woodson Center to promote its new educational series “1776.”
This project has brought together “an assembly of independent voices who uphold our country’s authentic founding virtues and values.” The writers of these essays, most of them black and all of them serious thinkers, come from ideologically diverse backgrounds. They are liberals, conservatives, academics, journalists, and activists. What they share in common is an aversion to the increasing infantilization of black America or the denial of blacks’ agency throughout their history. These writers share with one another a distaste for attempts at pseudoscholarship that would reduce all of U.S. history to a history of racism and all of black America to the permanent status of helpless victim.
The name they chose, “1776,” consciously echoes that of the New York Times’s 1619 Project, as it is intended to be an alternative. The flawed premise of that other enterprise was that slavery is not just the original sin that the U.S. has worked to overcome but actually makes up the nation’s foundational character and explains all of the social maladies in black America today.
There are many problems with this concept, as the 1776 authors note. For example, slavery cannot become an explanation for social maladies that didn’t even exist as recently as the Civil Rights era.
The evil of slavery in the early U.S. and its modern legacy must not be ignored. Slavery was an abomination and, for the founders of this nation, a daily reality. It had existed not since 1619 but from time immemorial. Some of the Founding Fathers embraced and defended this vile institution as it slithered its way into modernity as a form of permanent, race-based subjugation; others tolerated it, some very reluctantly, in the interest of forming what they hoped would become a more perfect union.
This nation has since become just that: more perfect. It was not an easy journey from ownership of blacks to the election of a black president, but the progress is real, as strangely loath as some are to admit it. The journey included the most destructive war in U.S. history in terms of both economic and human costs. It included the vicious lie of “separate but equal,” which abrogated the rule of law for a century. It included terrorism, intimidation, lynchings, and violent resistance to civil rights by the very authorities that were supposed to be protecting the rights of all.
But this story also has its heroes and its triumphs. It includes black and white abolitionists who stood and spoke out tirelessly on principles of freedom. It includes black families who were forced to build their own schools and community institutions. Blacks built up entrepreneurial enterprises and fortunes, and, sometimes, they rebuilt them after racist terrorism destroyed them. They built their own colleges and universities of the sort that produced key figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr. And, finally, after overcoming so many obstacles, they laid claim to the full set of rights that no one can deny them today, taking up their rightful place as first-class citizens.
The U.S. is now a more perfect union than it was. It is still not perfect, but it is a highly functional, dynamic, and successful nation and the most diverse nation in history.
Immigrants from every part of the world aspire to come to the United States, not because they want to share in ill-gotten wealth from slavery but because people all over the world tacitly understand and acknowledge that no one outdoes Americans in their welcoming attitude toward foreigners and their commitment to fairness and the rule of law.
We hope you will enjoy these essays, beginning with the introduction to the series by Robert Woodson. He holds up the oft-forgotten achievements of blacks even against the grain of Jim Crow as “a powerful refutation of the claim that the destiny of black Americans is determined by what whites do or what they have done in the past.”
We are also proud to host the "1776" essay by Clarence Page, the famed liberal columnist for the Chicago Tribune, whose work has now appeared in print in seven different decades. Page, distressed by “the long-held stereotypes of black people as helpless bystanders in their own history,” urges readers to “desegregate our poverty discussion.” The causes of black and white poverty, he notes, are often strikingly similar.
We have published 10 other essays, as well, which all appear on our "1776" landing page, and we will be adding more as we continue our celebration of Black History Month. Each of the essays at the above link contains valuable arguments, new perspectives, and nuggets of forgotten black history. They are well worth your attention.

Daily on Energy: Climate change is gaining on the economy as a top issue

CLIMATE CHANGE IS GAINING ON THE ECONOMY AS A TOP ISSUE: As the economy has improved, Americans feel better about kitchen table issues and are prioritizing protecting the environment and combating climate change.
Nearly as many people say protecting the environment should be a top policy priority (64%) as those who say this about strengthening the economy (67%), according to a Pew Research Center poll of 1,504 adults nationwide released Thursday. That’s the first time that gap has been so narrow between the economy and the environment as measured by Pew surveys since nearly two decades ago.
A smaller share, 52%, rate global climate change as a top priority, but that is 14 percentage points higher than three years ago.
Notably: Climate change now ranks above jobs (49%) as a top priority.
Republicans are less worried: Republicans are less concerned about environmental issues and climate change than Democrats are.
Dealing with climate change ranks at the bottom of the list of 18 policy priorities for Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (just 21% call it a “top priority, unchanged from a year ago).
This is despite other polls showing growing concern about climate change among young Republicans, a development that has prodded the congressional GOP to put forward climate change policy proposals.
Fewer than half of Republicans (39%) consider environmental protection as a “major priority,” according to the Pew poll, which is actually the largest share of Republicans saying this in the research center’s surveys over the past decade.
By contrast, climate change is near the top of important issues among Democrats and Democratic leaners (78% call it a top priority). That mirrors what voters are saying in the Democratic presidential primary, where climate change has ranked as a top two issue in the first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire.
Thought bubble: The responses by Republicans show that President Trump’s new rhetoric about protecting the environment, while still avoiding mentioning climate change, may be sufficient for most GOP voters.

NOTE TO READERS: Daily on Energy will not be published Monday, Feb. 17 in observance of Presidents’ Day. We will back Tuesday, Feb. 18. Until then, Happy Valentine’s Day, from the legendary Andre 3000.
NATURAL GAS PRICES DROP TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2016: Natural gas prices fell to their lowest level since 2016 this month, representing the lowest February prices in 20 years.
This Monday, the near-month natural gas futures price at the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $1.77 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), the lowest price in any month since March 8, 2016, the Energy Information Administration reported Friday. In addition, the daily spot price at the Henry Hub national benchmark was $1.81/MMBtu on Monday, the lowest price in real terms since March 9, 2016.
Prices are so low generally because warm winter weather (last month was the hottest January on record) has reduced demand for natural gas for home heating, the EIA says. Natural gas production growth has outpaced demand growth.
In January, the U.S. experienced the third-highest monthly natural gas production.
DELTA FLIES AHEAD WITH CARBON-NEUTRAL PLEDGE: Delta is pledging to spend $1 billion over the next decade to become the first carbon-neutral airline, the company announced Friday.
That means it wants to cancel out its future emissions starting from March by purchasing carbon emission reductions offsets and investing in environmental projects such as planting trees or other carbon capture techniques to compensate for emissions produced from its flights.
Most airlines rely on offsets to reduce emissions because there is not a widespread lower-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. Another major airline, JetBlue, announced last month it plans to be carbon-neutral on all domestic flights by July by increasing its purchase of offsets. Airlines represent about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
“We will continue to use jet fuel for as far as the eye can see,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s CEO, told CNBC on Friday. “We’ll be investing in technologies to reduce the impact of jet fuel, But I don’t ever see a future where we’ll eliminate jet fuel from our footprint.”
However in an acknowledgement that technologies funded by offsets need to be improved, Delta is also pledging to allocate some of its $1 billion to research innovations such as carbon removal.
“Carbon offsets are not the solution, we need to be investing in projects that make a difference,” Bastian said. “That’s not really helping our planet.”
FEDS LEAVING WATER UTILITIES HIGH AND DRY ON CLIMATE: Water and wastewater utilities are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but the federal government isn’t doing much to help them plan ahead for it.
A new report released Thursday by the Government Accountability Office says four federal agencies — including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — are in a position to do much more, including providing more financial assistance and coordinating long-term planning efforts for new and existing water infrastructure.
To date, federal efforts, mostly from the EPA, have been limited to small-scale and pilot assistance, and EPA officials told the GAO a water sector council the agency chairs has focused mostly on short-term threats to water infrastructure such as disasters and counterterrorism rather than climate resilience.
The consequences: Not helping water utilities plan for a warming future will cost the government more money. Already, from 2011 to 2018, the government spent at least $3.6 billion to help drinking water and wastewater utilities after natural disasters, according to the GAO.
EPA’S LATEST ENFORCEMENT NUMBERS ARE A MIXED BAG: The number of civil enforcement cases the EPA has initiated and concluded dropped for the third year in a row, to its lowest level in a decade, according to new data released by the agency on Thursday.
The EPA also conducted the fewest inspections and evaluations for the decade in fiscal year 2019. That number has been falling since 2012, according to the EPA data.
Criminal enforcement is a different story: The EPA boasted opening an increasing number of criminal cases for the second year in a row. It also required facilities to address the highest level of pollution, around 347 million pounds per year, in the last four years.
More industries are self-disclosing violations, too, a push that has been a priority for the Trump EPA team. In fiscal year 2019, more than 600 entities came forward voluntarily to disclose violations with environmental laws, a 20% bump from the year prior.
PRESS SECRETARY LEAVING EPA: The agency’s press secretary, Michael Abboud, is leaving EPA to join the State Department, he told reporters in an email Friday.
Abboud joins fellow EPA alum James Hewitt, a former communications staffer who left the agency for the State Department in June.
CONSERVATIVE TEAMS UP ON LONG-DURATION STORAGE BILL: Republican Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona joined Democrats Thursday to release a bill bolstering long-term energy storage.
The Joint Long-Term Storage Act, also sponsored by Chris Pappas of New Hampshire and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, would establish a program between the Defense and Energy Departments to integrate their efforts to develop storage technologies that can hold excess wind and solar power for a longer period of time.
“We continue to see innovative technologies that benefit both our national security and the environment, and I am pleased to be a part of this effort to further collaboration between the DOD and DOE that have the potential to scale up this technology,” said Schweikert, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who is leading figure shaping the House GOP’s climate change agenda.
Companion legislation has already been introduced by Senators Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Texto completo: U.S. Attorney John Durham is reportedly reviewing John Brennan’s analysis of Russian election interference, including scrutiny of the former Obama CIA director’s handling of a secret source said to be close to the Kremlin.
Durham, who was selected by Attorney General William Barr in 2019 to look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the government’s response to Moscow’s meddling, is investigating whether Brennan’s CIA was attempting to keep other agencies in the dark as he pushed for a specific, preconceived analytic assessment about Russia’s true intentions in 2016, the New York Times reported Thursday.

The top Connecticut prosecutor’s team reviewed emails from the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency analysts who came together to assess Russia’s interference, the new report revealed, and Durham’s investigators pressed for answers about why some agencies at least temporarily denied other agencies access to secretive intelligence about the Kremlin’s active-measures campaign.
Durham interviewed agents and analysts from all three agencies, and the report said he was scrutinizing whether the clash over intelligence-sharing was the typical sort of bureaucratic turf battle over jealously guarded secrets or an effort to cover something up.
Much of this revolves around how the United States government eventually reached its January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian meddling and whether Brennan was pushing for a biased result.
One major battle was about the identity and credibility of a CIA source allegedly close to the Kremlin. The NSA wanted more details about him, which the CIA resisted before providing them. The NSA then disagreed with the CIA and FBI about how much confidence to place in the source.
At least some intelligence officials were disturbed by a law enforcement officer such as Durham inquiring into the assessments made by intelligence agencies, though Durham played a similar role in his Obama-era investigation into the CIA's destruction of tapes showing the harsh interrogation of detainees.
Durham hasn’t yet interviewed Brennan, though the report said his emails and other records have been requested from the CIA by the U.S. attorney. Retired Adm. Mike Rogers, who was head of the NSA at the time, was interviewed by Durham last summer and fall.
The January 2017 intelligence community assessment in question concluded with "high confidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin “ordered an influence campaign in 2016” and that Russia worked to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency” and “developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.” The NSA diverged on one aspect, expressing only “moderate confidence” that Putin actively tried to help Trump’s election chances and harm those of Clinton by contrasting her unfavorably.
“I wouldn’t call it a discrepancy, I’d call it an honest difference of opinion between three different organizations, and, in the end, I made that call,” Rogers told the Senate in May 2017. “It didn’t have the same level of sourcing and the same level of multiple sources.”
It was Brennan’s still-classified “wake-up call” intelligence that prompted the Obama administration to reconsider how it viewed Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed last week. The specifics of the intelligence that jolted Barack Obama's national security team into action is detailed in a blacked-out section, titled “[Redacted] Intelligence Was The ‘Wake Up’ Call.”
Within an hour or two of being briefed on the intelligence, then-national security adviser Susan Rice said Obama needed to know.
Rice said “the president's reaction was of grave concern,” which “prompted her to call the first of a series of restricted small-group Principals Committee meetings on the topic.”
“During the meeting with the President, Director Brennan also advised the President of a plan to brief key individuals, including congressional leadership, but not to disseminate the intelligence via routine reporting channels,” the Senate report stated.
The committee noted “the receipt of the sensitive intelligence prompted the National Security Council to begin a series of restricted Principals Committee meetings to craft the administration's response” and said the discussions “were atypically restricted” and “excluded” key officials who were normally clued in.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said that “the extraordinarily restricted nature of the meetings and departure from routine methods of disseminating intelligence were reminiscent” of how they handled preparations for the Osama bin Laden raid. Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates called it “very cloak-and-dagger.”
The list even initially excluded the secretary of state, the defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Treasury secretary.
“Several NSC officials who would normally be included in discussions of importance, such as the NSC Senior Director for Russia, the Senior Director for Intelligence Programs, and the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, were neither included in the discussions nor exposed to the sensitive intelligence until after the election,” the report said.
The Brennan-relayed intelligence was likely detailed in a June 2017 Washington Post article, which stated that in early August 2016, the CIA sent an “eyes only” envelope addressed to Obama that contained an “intelligence bombshell … from sourcing deep inside the Russian government” that detailed Putin’s “specific instructions” to help Trump and hurt Clinton in 2016. The material was said to be so sensitive it was kept out of the President’s Daily Brief.

One day after Trump gave Barr “full and complete” declassification authority to examine the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation in May 2019, the New York Times published a piece on this source “long-nurtured by the CIA” whom the outlet hinted was now in danger of being exposed in Russia — but he had already left the country. The source’s initial resistance to being pulled out reportedly led some to question whether he might be a double agent.

Hotly disputed reporting by CNN and others in September 2019 about the reasons for the alleged source’s apparent 2017 exfiltration from Russia eventually exposed his identity and revealed he was living in the D.C. area. He’s since been moved, and it is not known whether Durham has questioned him.

Trump sending dozens of Border Patrol agents to sanctuary cities

Texto completo: The Trump administration is deploying Border Patrol officers to aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 10 sanctuary cities.
The federal government is assigning 100 Customs and Border Protection tactical officers to temporarily join ICE agents in sanctuary cities that have passed laws ordering local law enforcement to ignore federal immigration laws, according to the New York Times.
The CBP deployment will last from February to May and will "enhance integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security," CBP spokesman Lawrence Payne said.
The CBP officials will be assigned to Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, New Orleans, New York City, and San Francisco.
"As we have noted for years, in jurisdictions where we are not allowed to assume custody of aliens from jails, our officers are forced to make at-large arrests of criminal aliens who have been released into communities," ICE acting Director Matthew Albence said in a statement. "When sanctuary cities release these criminals back to the street, it increases the occurrence of preventable crimes and, more importantly, preventable victims."
CBP officers enforce U.S. immigration laws at ports of entry, such as airports, and within 100 miles of the border. Immigration enforcement in the middle of the country is usually left to ICE.
Former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske criticized the decision, calling it overkill and a significant risk.
"If you were a police chief and you were going to make an apprehension for a relatively minor offense, you don’t send the SWAT team, and [the Border Patrol Tactical Unit] is the SWAT team," Kerlikowske said. "They’re trained for much more hazardous missions than this."

Marina Gomberg: I hope to raise a son who sidesteps the toxic aspects of masculinity. But how?

Texto completo: We were going to have a boy, at least biologically.
When my wife, Elenor, and I learned this it unleashed an unexpected swirl of emotions. It was like a weighted blanket: warm, cozy and yet heavy on every part of my body.
We were going to be partially responsible for the actions of a man.
Now, I don’t mean to sound second-wave feminist with “all men are bad” sentiments (my experiences alone prove that wrong), but the reality that most crime, war and violence has been perpetuated at the hands of men hasn’t escaped me.
Nor have I escaped the painful manifestations of toxic masculinity myself.
But if my gender studies education taught me anything, it’s that the ways we perform our gender, whether stereotypically or non-binary, are important ingredients that make up our individualized flavors. But as meaningful as those expressions are, they are not all innate, and so much is influenced by our environments.
Think about Western cowboys versus New England gentlemen. Or machismo versus drag culture. The ways we’ve defined how men should act and look are as numerous as there are different places and cultures, although some characteristics seem to span the vast majority of masculinities.
The notion that expressions of manhood can be shaped from the outside gives me hope, but also, the blanket feeling. It’s on us to help create the environment in which a compassionate, equity-minded, respectful dude person can bloom. But what kind of soil and how much light does it take to nurture non-toxic masculinity?
Elenor and I have had conversations about this since before our son, Harvey, was born. And when I recently had the most serendipitous experience of hearing Sarah Jane Johnson’s story on “The Moth | Radio Hour” (she spoke of surviving sexual assault in college and the triumphant work of reconciling that past as she planned to birth a son — who she and her wife named Harvey!! — through the same place she was so violated), I decided to dig a little deeper into the topic.
I researched and reached out to some of my favorite feminists (including my new “life doppelgänger,” as she puts it, Sarah Jane Johnson) and the wellspring of wisdom that is my Facebook community, seeking to understand how others approach raising sons.
Four ideas became fortified for me:
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
The golden rule says to treat others as you want to be treated, but the platinum rule is what we go by in our house: Treat others as they want to be treated by you.
To borrow a line about respect from the great Aretha Franklin, “find out what it means to me.”
This idea is the foundation of consent and it applies to all things: showing affection including when and how, taking photos, allowing privacy, etc.
Be curious and courageous enough to ask how someone wants to be treated in any given moment, and respect their wishes. Full stop.
Expanding possibility
Feminist powerhouse Gloria Steinem said, “I’m glad we’ve begun to raise our daughters more like our sons, but it will never work until we raise our sons more like our daughters.” I’ve long wondered what she meant and then I found Claire Cain Miller’s piece in The New York Times called “How to Raise a Feminist Son” that shows how “we raise our girls to fight stereotypes and pursue their dreams, but we don’t do the same for our boys.”
We’re now investing significant resources (and rightly so) into teaching girls that the traditional notions of femininity need not always be applied — that girls in the 21st century can be and do anything they want. Celebrated athletes? Yep. All-female spacewalks? Now that we’ve got enough suits that fit, you bet. President of the United States? I believe it’s possible.
For example, tomboys and female pantsuits are now celebrated, but on the flip side, the Scottish and actor Billy Porter are among the small minority of men embracing dresses (and I’m not even sure kilt-wearing men consider their attire as feminine-inspired).
If we expand the possibilities for our boys from clothing to toys to emotional expressions, we can shatter the confines that keep them feeling like they shouldn’t cry, nurture, feel fear, be gentle or twirl like a princess.
Plan International’s State of Gender Equality for U.S. Adolescents survey of more than 1,000 boys ages 10-19 found only 2% said society values honesty and morality in men, 33% said they are expected to hide or suppress their feelings and 44% said society expects them to be aggressive or violent when they get angry.
Ah, there are the seeds of toxic masculinity we might reconsider sowing.
Purposeful exposure
Much of the great advice from my peers was about modeling positive behavior, using inclusive language (like, not all bugs are male) and providing repeated exposure to ideas that challenge old norms.
Several folks talked about highlighting women’s triumphs and challenges, and introducing their children to successful and powerful women. The same is true about showing and revering men who share in household work, get in their feels and who use their privilege to empower women.
I asked queer/feminist activist Kate Kendall how she’s managed to raise a feminist son, and she said in a reply tweet: “Talking about sexism, values, kindness early and often. Wide ranging political convos as he gets older, exposure to books and media that frames your values. Good men in his and your life, aka, Grandpa....” She’s referring to my dad who has dedicated his life to leveling the playing field for marginalized folks of all walks of life. Good idea.
Elenor and I also curate our kidlet’s media library pretty carefully to include books with female heroes and stories of lions who write poetry. Constant, thoughtful, diverse, representational fun.
Engaged kindness
If respect is born from the same place as doctors’ Hippocratic oath (in essence, do no harm), then engaged kindness is respect elevated.
Johnson described what she hopes for her now 2 ½ year-old son, Harvey. It’s not that she’s expecting a savior or superhero, but she wants him to be an active part of making the world a safer, more compassionate place. She wants him to “walk through the world seeing when someone needs help, and taking action.”
I like that.
I see my Harvey and I want him to be the man he is — whatever that may be — and I also plan to do my best to show him the power and possibility of compassionate masculinity.

First vote by Utah woman under equal suffrage law 150 years ago wasn’t big news in local newspapers

Texto completo: When a Utah woman became the first in the country to vote under an equal suffrage law in 1870, local newspapers didn’t splash it across the front page.
“You don’t see anything in the paper at the time saying, ‘Rah! Rah! We’re the very first ones to go to the polls!’ I don’t know if they even recognized that historic significance of it at the time,” said Katherine Kitterman, historical director for Better Days 2020, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting this history.
But this week, Utah newspapers, television and radio news, websites and posts on social media are highlighting celebrations of the 150th anniversary of that historic vote.
On Feb. 12, 1870, Utah’s acting governor signed a bill giving women the right to vote in the territory. Two days later, Seraph Young, a grandniece of Brigham Young, cast a ballot in a Salt Lake City municipal election, becoming the first woman in the country to vote under an equal suffrage law.
[ Read more: Once a footnote, the Utah woman who was first to vote is being celebrated 150 years later ]
Utah women received the right to vote twice before the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920. After federal anti-polygamy legislation disenfranchised women in 1887, they regained suffrage when Utah became a state in 1896.
The Deseret Evening News reported on Utah women’s first vote in 1870 with an article on page three of the newspaper the following day.
“The Municipal Election of yesterday ought to satisfy everybody, unless there were some desirous of a ‘row,'” the article states. “... Everybody voted as he or she desired and none troubled themselves about it. A few ladies exerted their right to vote under the law published on Saturday; and we believe the first one who recorded her vote was Miss Seraph Young, daughter of B.H. Young Esq.”
Local newspaper coverage didn’t name any of the other women who voted in that first election, but roughly 25 or so women are estimated to have participated, Kitterman said. There’s a commemorative postcard in the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints history library featuring “Five Generations of Voting Mormon Women,” which claims that Mary Gibbs-Bigelow and Lucy Bigelow-Young also voted on that day. But Kitterman said she hasn’t been able to find much more information than that.
The New York Times ran the headline “Women Vote in Utah," with an article that questioned whether Utah women would vote against the church’s interest and cast down polygamy, as some U.S. Congressmen and eastern suffragists hoped.
“The result of the first experiments in women’s voting will be watched for with the greatest interest and curiosity,” the newspaper reported.
On Feb. 16, 1870, The Deseret News stated, “On the plural marriage question we are as firmly convinced as we are of our own existence that were its continuance or abolition put to the vote of the female portion of our population to-day it would be sustained by a nine-tenths majority; and upon this score, which has enlisted the mock sympathy of so many, no disadvantage to Zion’s cause will ensue.”
There’s no coverage of that first vote by The Salt Lake Tribune because the newspaper didn’t publish its first issue until the following year.
But other area newspapers reported on the lead up to the Utah Territorial Legislature passing the bill enfranchising women. “A preponderance of the members seemed in favor of the proposed extension of suffrage,” according to a Feb. 2, 1870, article in The Ogden Junction.
The article went on: "What will those folks east and west, who are so worried about the women of Utah being enslaved, say to this step, which places Utah a long way ahead of the most radical New England State in extending to woman equal political rights with man? There is little doubt that ... it will be an effectual squelcher to those luxuriant romancists who have pictured so vividly the slavish and degraded condition of woman in Utah.”
As the bill was considered days later, the newspaper reported, “A number of ladies were accommodated with seats in the Council Chamber, and were evidently much interested in the discussion. The debate was spirited and amicable, sound arguments being advanced with a genial flow of wit and humor.”
On Feb. 12, 1870, the Deseret Evening News congratulated acting governor S.A. Mann for signing the bill into law, “which we have no doubt will afford much satisfaction to all the citizens of the Territory, and will be a lasting honor to his name.”
Mann wasn’t so sure. “I have very grave and serious doubts of the wisdom and soundness of that political economy which makes the act a law of this Territory,” he wrote in a letter included with the article. But he deferred to the “the unanimous passage of the act in both the House and the Council,” and the “judgment of many whose opinion I very much respect.”

Texto completo: Two years ago Friday, 17 people were shot to death at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., by a man who should not have had a gun. When a friend reminded me of this “anniversary” a couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he believed that was an appropriate word for the occasion. “I hadn’t thought about it,” he said.
The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that our gun violence problem is also a language problem — euphemisms, distortions, misdirections. But it turns out the Parkland students are addressing this problem in their own unique way.
My anniversary is July 7, the day my wife, Anne Marie, and I were married. It was one of the happiest days of my life. She was pregnant with Galen, who was born on Sept. 27, 1974, another happiest day. Eighteen years later, on Dec. 14, 1992, Galen was killed in a school shooting. It always felt obscene to associate that event with an “anniversary.”
It gets worse. Our son wasn’t “taken,” as common parlance has it. He was shot and killed by a man who should not have had a gun. People sometimes tell me how tragic it was that Galen happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is intended as consolation, but it’s no help to me. It was Galen’s killer who was in the wrong place — in every sense.
But is that even what people mean? Doesn’t “wrong” imply some kind of fault? Galen’s entire life brought him to that last fatal place at the last fatal moment. Are people implying that he’d lived it in error?
Galen had never been in “the wrong place.” He was murdered, not “lost,” another way of misstating this hideous circumstance. And who, as well-meaning people sometimes do, would issue a “trigger warning” to survivors of gun violence? Or advise me to give “my best shot” at telling Galen’s story? Or even ask me if I’d be willing to “share” it? I’m always happy to help, but that kindly locution gives me pause. If someone put a bowl of vomit in front of you, would that be considered “sharing?”
And what about the scripted manner in which the news media portrays mass shootings? The 911 call transcript, Humvees disgorging SWAT teams, witnesses hugging and weeping, ambulances rolling away, candles lit at “memorials.” We never see a body. We never see what a .223 round of ammunition can actually do to a human. It has all been sanitized. When I hear a congressman call for a “moment of silence,” I hear him saying, “I don’t want to talk about this.”
We respond to gun violence in such a manner because the thing of which we speak is so hideous that we need to normalize it. Our word choices conceal the true nature of gun violence in an effort to make it go away. And that’s precisely the problem.
One hundred people die from the coronavirus and the world freaks out. One hundred people are killed by guns each day in America and it’s business as usual. The ugly fact is that gun violence can happen wherever there are guns, and guns are everywhere: There are nearly 400 million civilian-owned guns in this country, and they’re not going away.
Perhaps if we acknowledged this fact, if we found ways of addressing the situation as it truly is, we’d be closer to solving the one problem on which Second Amendment nuts and gun-grabbers can agree: How do we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them?
And one other thing. It’s heartbreaking to see and hear, over and over again, stories told by parents whose children have been killed, and by children whose classmates have been slaughtered before their eyes. After a while, however, we burn out on these stories. They cease to inspire us to action; they make us want to turn the channel.
This is what so encourages me about what those Parkland survivors have been doing. They’re “sharing” their stories, sure. But they’ve also been using their teenage smarts and snark to leverage those stories, to “weaponize” them. They are nudging the narrative away from the old ideological stalemate and focusing on a moral question: What kind of society allows such unfettered access to the tools of slaughter?
At the March for Our Lives rally in Washington in 2018, they pinned bright orange price tags to their shirts with the numbers $1.05. That’s how much money they say the National Rifle Association spent to support the campaigns of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida divided by the number of students in the state.
When one student, David Hogg, took the stage, he said, “I’m going to start off by putting this price tag right here just to remind you guys just how much Marco Rubio took for every student’s life in Florida: one dollar and five cents.” The Parkland survivors are getting through to us more effectively because they’ve found ways of talking about their situation that are startlingly and refreshingly direct.

David Brooks: Education is how Scandinavia got great

Texto completo: Almost everybody admires the Nordic model. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have high economic productivity, high social equality, high social trust and high levels of personal happiness.
Progressives say it’s because they have generous welfare states. Some libertarians point out that these countries score high on nearly every measure of free market openness. Immigration restrictionists note that until recently they were ethnically homogeneous societies.
But Nordic nations were ethnically homogeneous in 1800 when they were dirt poor. Their economic growth took off just after 1870, way before their welfare states were established. What really launched the Nordic nations was generations of phenomenal educational policy.
The 19th-century Nordic elites did something we haven’t been able to do in this country recently. They realized that if their countries were to prosper they had to create truly successful “folk schools” for the least educated among them. They realized that they were going to have to make lifelong learning a part of the natural fabric of society.
They look at education differently than we do. The German word they used to describe their approach, bildung, doesn’t even have an English equivalent. It means the complete moral, emotional, intellectual and civic transformation of the person. It was based on the idea that if people were going to be able to handle and contribute to an emerging industrial society, they would need more complex inner lives.
Today, Americans often think of schooling as the transmission of specialized skill sets — can the student read, do math, recite the facts of biology. Bildung is devised to change the way students see the world. It is devised to help them understand complex systems and see the relations between things — between self and society, between a community of relationships in a family and a town.
As Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman put it in their book “The Nordic Secret,” “Bildung is the way that the individual matures and takes upon him or herself ever bigger personal responsibility towards family, friends, fellow citizens, society, humanity, our globe and the global heritage of our species, while enjoying ever bigger personal, moral and existential freedoms.”
The Nordic educators worked hard to cultivate each student’s sense of connection to the nation. Before the 19th century, most Europeans identified themselves in local and not national terms. But the Nordic curriculum instilled in students a pride in, say, their Danish history, folklore and heritage.
“That which a person did not burn for in his young days, he will not easily work for as a man,” Christopher Arndt Bruun wrote. The idea was to create in the mind of the student a sense of wider circles of belonging — from family to town to nation — and an eagerness to assume shared responsibility for the whole.
The Nordic educators also worked hard to develop the student’s internal awareness. That is to say, they helped students see the forces always roiling inside the self — the emotions, cravings, wounds and desires. If you could see those forces and their interplay, as if from the outside, you could be their master and not their slave.
Their intuition was that as people grow, they have the ability to go through developmental phases, to see themselves and the world through ever more complex lenses. A young child may blindly obey authority — Mom, Dad, teacher. Then she internalizes and conforms to the norms of the group. Then she learns to create her own norms based on her own values. Then she learns to see herself as a node in a network of selves and thus learns mutuality and holistic thinking.
The purpose of bildung is to help people move through the uncomfortable transitions between each way of seeing.
That educational push seems to have had a lasting influence on the culture. Whether in Stockholm or Minneapolis, Scandinavians have a tendency to joke about the way their sense of responsibility is always nagging at them. They have the lowest rates of corruption in the world. They have a distinctive sense of the relationship between personal freedom and communal responsibility.
High social trust doesn’t just happen. It results when people are spontaneously responsible for one another in the daily interactions of life, when the institutions of society function well.
In the U.S., social trust has been on the decline for decades. If the children of privilege get to go to the best schools, there’s not going to be much social mutuality. If those schools do not instill a love of nation, there’s not going to be much shared responsibility.
If you have a thin educational system that does not help students see the webs of significance between people, does not even help students see how they see, you’re going to wind up with a society in which people can’t see through each other’s lenses.
When you look at the Nordic bildung model, you realize our problem is not only that we don’t train people with the right job skills. It’s that we don’t have the right lifelong development model to instill the mode of consciousness people need to thrive in a complex pluralistic society.

Austin Bay: National security structure dangerously exploited

Texto completo: Two months have passed since Dec. 9, 2019, the day Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz exposed the profound damage done to a judicial institution vital to successfully defending America in a world of complex threats: the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISC.
The damage done to American public trust in the court is not incidental. Trust is a source of strength, among friends or in the world’s most powerful nation. Trust promotes cooperation, which enhances systemic strength. When trust disappears, expect discord seeding division and weakness.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656846" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Austin-Bay-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
The FISC was created to protect a citizen’s constitutional rights while permitting intelligence community surveillance of legitimate suspects. To protect necessary cloak-and-dagger secrets, the FISC meets in secret. A secret court in a free society requires two things: (1) legitimate existential threats to citizens and assets: (2) trust in security agency professionalism and integrity, and trust in the judgment of the court judges.
Unfortunately, the abuse of the FISC by corrupt members of U.S. security and legal agencies — specifically within the FBI and DOJ — may have squandered that trust forever. Evidence is emerging that other corrupt actors, perhaps in the CIA, conducted illegal surveillance.
With the documented abuse acknowledged, America needs an FISC-type legal tool to combat covert threats like terrorism, transnational crime and enemy espionage. Twenty-first-century digital and financial connectivity, and commercial jet transportation, reduce police and Pentagon response time.
A FISC with integrity must also protect an American citizen’s constitutional rights from crooks and crony government. Horowitz discovered premeditated fraud on the FISC by a DOJ attorney. In 2016, the attorney “altered” email from “the other U.S. government agency” (CIA) and submitted a fraudulent application for a warrant to the court. So the FISC approved the warrant.
The target: Carter Page, a Naval Academy graduate and a former Trump presidential campaign associate. Spying on Page — an innocent man — opened a door to spying on President Donald Trump.
Following Horowitz’s report, the FISC’s then-presiding judge, Rosemary Collyer, issued a public order regarding the Page application and the FBI’s lack of “candor”: “The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable. The FISC expects the government to provide complete and accurate information in every filing with the Court.”
Collyer should chastise herself as well. She and her colleagues failed to responsibly question the application. The FBI alleges a Naval Academy grad associated with a presidential campaign in an election year is a Russian asset? Judge, wake the hell up. Page was actually a CIA asset.
Trump administration Attorney General William Barr knows the court is a national security asset and wants to save it. On Feb. 6, he put his personal reputation on the line and issued a memo requiring the FBI to have him sign off on FISC applications. Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz pegs the FISC’s structural weakness: Alleged perpetrators have no defender. So assign a lawyer to question government evidence.
To restore public trust, the individuals who abused the court must be investigated, arrested, tried, convicted and sent to prison. They committed an array of crimes — including criminal mishandling of classified material. The FISC is a classified court.
In the past, the public expected responsible reporters to scrutinize government operations. In the FISC saga, contemporary mainstream media served as a PR tool for crooked cops and spies. So-called elite press outfits like The New York Times and The Washington Post unquestioningly touted intelligence leaks that have proven to be false.
Though mainstream media outlets take scant notice, angry calls to disband the court have not faded. The decibels will increase when federal prosecutor John Durham’s investigation into the origins of the Russia collusion hoax becomes headline news.
I wager Durham will expose crony government at its worst — dirty government officials, bureaucrats and agents who are politically exploiting and criminally manipulating the U.S. national security structure to harm their political opponents.
We shall see.

Cottle: Vengeance is mine, saith the president

Texto completo: John Bolton, Joe Manchin, Adam Schiff, Hunter Biden, Doug Jones, Gordon Sondland, Alexander Vindman, Yevgeny Vindman, Mitt Romney, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Jerry Nadler, Debbie Dingell, New York air travelers, federal prosecutors, the FBI. It has been barely a week since Senate Republicans acquitted President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial — assuring him once and for all that he needn’t fret about congressional accountability — but he has already made significant progress on his enemies list.
Members of Congress, administration officials, law enforcement officials, residents of blue states — anyone who has ever displeased Trump is a potential target. Heads may not wind up on literal pikes, but the president is already neck-deep into his reprisal tour.
The president’s targets can be sorted into multiple different categories, some better equipped than others to endure his wrath. Democratic senators such as Jones of Alabama and Manchin of West Virginia, both of whom have drawn Trumpian ire for their votes to convict the president, understand that politics is a blood sport. Ditto House members like Dingell, whom Trump randomly attacked again over the weekend, and Schiff, who was the point person on impeachment. These professionals know how to brush off — or brush back — the taunts.
After a particularly childish screed, in which Trump called Manchin “Joe Munchkin,” the West Virginia lawmaker returned fire Monday on CNN: “I guess he’s confused on that, because I am a little bigger than him. He’s got me about 30 pounds on weight. But I am a little taller than him.”
And the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, can certainly hold her own against a presidential tantrum.
Romney, the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump of abuse of power, is more exposed. It’s not just the president mocking him and denigrating his religious faith. The White House also blasted out nasty talking points for surrogates to disseminate. Title: “Romney (Once Again) Ditches Principles to Seek Far Left’s Adulation.”
That said, Romney is a former presidential combatant. He knows how to take a punch. He also isn’t up for reelection until 2024, plenty of time for all this to pass. In the meantime, he’ll enjoy some brand burnishing in non-Trump circles for having followed his conscience.
Trump is also grumpy with Bolton, the former national security adviser who, the New York Times reported, wrote in his forthcoming memoir that the president told him that there was a link between Ukraine aid and the announcement of investigations of Joe Biden and his son. In addition to calling Bolton a liar, Trump has sought to block the release of his book, and there is talk of stripping him of his security clearance.
But Bolton, too, is nobody’s victim. He is a seasoned Washington knife-fighter who played his own coy game with impeachment investigators.
It’s also hard to feel too sorry for Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union whom Trump fired last week. Sondland essentially bought his diplomatic post with fat donations to Trump’s inauguration. He changed his testimony mid-impeachment, rendering him a less than exemplary witness. He is, above all, a cautionary tale for those willing to sell their souls for power and prestige.
Far more troubling is the assault on not-so-political public servants, such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key impeachment witness. Vindman was ousted from his post on the National Security Council.
Creepier still, the president also fired Vindman’s twin brother, Yevgeny, a lawyer at the National Security Council who was not an impeachment witness. Such gratuitous score-settling carries a whiff of the Cosa Nostra, in which talking to the feds results in one’s family being targeted — in part to send a message to other potential rats.
Trump is making perfectly clear the high cost of questioning his questionable behavior or cooperating with Congress.
Also this week, federal prosecutors are back in the president’s cross hairs. On Monday, prosecutors recommended sentencing Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political fixer who was convicted in November on charges stemming from Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian influence, to seven to nine years behind bars. This did not sit well with the president, who was up in the wee hours on Tuesday tweeting his displeasure. “Disgraceful!” he erupted shortly before 1 a.m. Not quite an hour later, he elaborated: “This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!”
By Tuesday afternoon, the Justice Department had dutifully announced it would revisit the “grossly disproportionate” sentencing recommendation. All four prosecutors handling the case promptly withdrew.
Far from denying Operation Vengeance, the White House has been justifying it. In the run-up to the president’s acquittal address last Thursday, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, assured Fox News viewers that he would be talking about “just how horribly he was treated and, you know, that maybe people should pay for that.”
Trump is now hard at work making that happen. And who’s to stop him?

Texto completo: We have two stellar new additions to the fast-growing Texas Tribune staff. Mitchell Ferman will become our first Houston-based reporter, focusing on energy and the economy, and Jon Garza has joined us as audience analyst.
Ferman has most recently been a reporter at The Monitor in McAllen, where he has covered cross-border trade, politics and the city of McAllen (including how taxpayers funded lavish requests by Enrique Iglesias). He has also been regularly freelancing from the Rio Grande Valley and beyond for The New York Times, Texas Monthly and Reuters, writing about topics including the family separation crisis and unexpected consequences of the border wall. He is a graduate of the University of Missouri.
At the Tribune, Ferman will cover everything from oil booms and busts to innovations in renewable energy — and he’ll also take a broader look at the Texas economy. He’ll do much of this from the Energy Capital of the World, though his reporting will also take him outside of Houston. He will be based at the offices of our partners at Houston Public Media.
Ferman starts March 9. A food lover, he is looking forward to exploring Houston’s much-lauded culinary offerings.
Garza joined the Tribune this month. He most recently worked at Integrate Agency, a digital marketing and public relations company in Austin, where he was a marketing analyst. He previously worked for the University of Texas at Austin’s Information Security Office. He is a graduate of UT-Austin.
Garza's work at the Tribune focuses on analyzing data to help inform strategic decisions about reaching our audience. Outside of work, he’s a U.S. history enthusiast who has a goal of visiting every presidential library.
Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors. Financial supporters play no role in the Tribune's journalism. Find a complete list of them here.

Amid coronavirus fears, our relationship with masks remains complicated

Texto completo: If both the deepest and shallowest repercussions of walking around with a surgical mask in a time of coronavirus can be experienced by one single person, Jeannie Ding, a Boston University junior with an It girl vibe, is that person.
It was a Friday afternoon in early February and she'd recently returned to BU from her native province in China, Jiangxi. It's about a four-hour drive from Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and because she had the sniffles, and was worried about the disease, she's been wearing one of those cheap surgical face masks, sometimes covering her mouth and nose, sometimes, admittedly, looped behind her ears and resting under her chin (but more on this in a moment).
First, the serious incident: Dingwas on the B Line, she said, when a Chinese-American man began yelling at her in Chinese, screaming that she shouldn't wear a mask because it would spread the ugly stereotype of Asian people spreading disease. “He said I was bringing shame to all the Chinese people," Ding said.
Now the more frivolous side, which explains why her mask was not currently covering her nose and mouth. “I feel like it's not polite when I'm wearing my mask and talking to people," she said. And: “If I put on makeup but no one can see my face it doesn't make sense." Her lipstick was covet-worthy MAC.
More than a month into the coronavirus scare, our relationship with masks is complicated. Unsure if they actually work at keeping us safe, we're nonetheless hoarding them and at the same time suspicious of anyone who actually wears one. Not so many people are wearing masks that it's common, but at the same time, enough people are wearing them that it's become a thing around Boston.
When a mask appears, in a packed T car — or even just passing by on the sidewalk — you can almost hear the unasked questions: Are you sick? Or trying not to get sick?
The masks and fear of the coronavirus are fueling anti-Chinese racism, and also increasing suspicion of people with compromised immune systems whose mask use predates the outbreak.
Nicki Kattouf, a colon cancer survivor, is in the latter category. She wore a mask when undergoing treatment, and although she's a confident person, the looks from strangers didn't make her feel great.
“I didn't want people to think I had the plague," said Kattouf, a field marketing manager for a staffing agency in Boston, “but I couldn't go person to person saying, 'I'm going through chemo, you will not catch what I have.' "
Molly Kruko, an administrative assistant at MIT who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, wears a mask because medication she takes suppresses her immune system.
Unwilling to jeopardize her health “for the judgment of others," she nonetheless chooses masks intended to look nonthreatening.
She's got one decorated with unicorns, another with dogs, a third with a floral print. All come from a San Francisco firm called Vogmask, where the emphasis is on serious protection from airborne particles — but in an Instagram-friendly style. “Vogmask speaks unpretentious Californian," the mission statement reads, “and always strives to be a positive voice for the environment and humanity."
Kruko worked for years in Japan, she said, where people regularly wear masks to filter out germs and pollutants. And as someone susceptible to chest infections even before taking medicine for MS, she loved the trend.
“I was always a little jealous," Kruko said. “Here it's not socially acceptable."
A face mask just made the red carpet at the Grammy Awards when the teenage singing star Billie Eilish rocked a sheer black Gucci number. But it's safe to say that craze-wise, in this country, masks will not be the next athleisure.
That's in contrast to countries such as China, according to a medical anthropologist, where masks are much more than simply a way to protect yourself from infection.
“In the West, the image of Asian people with masks is sometimes wielded, deliberately or not, as a signifier of otherness," Christos Lynteris, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, wrote in The New York Times. “But in East Asia, the act of wearing a mask is a gesture that communicates solidarity during an epidemic — a time when a community is vulnerable to being divided by fear, between the healthy and the sick."
The Centers for Disease Control is not recommending that the general public in the United States wear masks to protect themselves from respiratory viruses. But with the director of the World Health Organization calling the coronavirus a “very grave threat to the world," people nonetheless are on heightened germ alert.
On a recent day in Coolidge Corner, for example, Trader Joe's beloved food-sample station was sampling hand sanitizer, and it was “going like hot cakes," according to the employee at the station.
Back at BU, where the Chinese Students Association recently handed out masks, Kaiwen Qian, a junior from Shanghai, was decidedly not wearing a mask. Why not? Didn't his parents back home want him to wear one? “Yes," he said, before making a confession: to make them happy, he bought a box, and, to prove it, showed it to them on WeChat, China's most popular messaging app.
Alas, filial concern did not extend to actually wearing the mask. “I don't think I'll get sick," he said. “But I want my parents to feel safe."

Victoria's Secret is out; women want comfortable underwear that fits

Texto completo: On a recent day off from school, teenagers Ellie Sung and Isabella Mas were wandering the Copley Place mall. As she paused for a break, Sung took out her phone and began searching for bras online — ignoring the Victoria's Secret store a few feet away.
Sung, 15, is just not a fan of the brand, which she said doesn't reflect her values. “I know they're transphobic and not inclusive," she said, echoing a prevailing criticism of the retail giant. “If young girls are shopping, they need to see every body type."
Young women like Sung have helped upend Victoria's Secret's status as the lingerie industry's juggernaut. The company once synonymous with sexy is now seen by many as passé, out of step with what modern women seem to want: comfortable bras and underwear that fit properly on a range of body types. Its parent company, L Brands, has seen its stock sag 75 percent since 2015 as it's faced a litany of troubles, including investigations into chief executive Lex Wexner's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and a scathing report this month from The New York Times alleging its executives created a “culture of misogyny, bullying, and harassment." According to CNBC, a possible sale of the company could happen soon.
The chaos at Victoria's Secret has been a boon for new entrants into the $11.9 billion intimate apparel category, and local retailers and lingerie designers are now eager to steal their share of the underwear drawer.
Lisa Mullan, who in a previous life helped usher HubSpot through its IPO, got her start making “beautiful, functional" silk undies because she didn't want to choose between style and comfort. The cofounder of Uwila Warrior now sells her underwear on Neiman Marcus and Free People websites and in her store on Charles Street in Beacon Hill.
“I have young kids and I'm working," she said. “I don't need underwear that is giving me a wedgie."
Local lingerie purveyors say they are seeing a lift in part thanks to the blitz of Instagram ads from direct-to-consumer brands like ThirdLove, Lively, and Cuup that use algorithms, quizzes, and “fit therapists" to help women find their perfect size. They also point to the messaging of brands like American Eagle's Aerie and Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, which feature full-figured women on full display.
Meredith Amenkhienan and Rachel Wentworth, owners of the Forty Winks boutique in Harvard Square, will celebrate a decade in the lingerie business in April, and say they had their strongest year in 2019. The “better fit" messaging that ThirdLove promotes is actually driving shoppers into their store. You can't get one-on-one fittings when you're getting a bra in the mail, Amenkhienan joked.
“It's good for the industry, it's pushing a lot of people to rethink what lingerie means," she said. “But we have had customers who come in who tried ThirdLove and it didn't work for them. They want to come in and touch and feel. It's helping us."
Now in her 40s, Lauren Beitelspacher, a marketing professor at Babson College, said she used to be the target audience for Victoria's Secret. “But I've gotten older, and it hasn't gotten older with me," she said. "I don't want to shop there anymore, and the younger generation doesn't want to shop there because they don't want the things that it stands for."
The prospect of receiving a frilly, lacy little number for Valentine's Day doesn't jibe with the current cultural climate, Beitelspacher said. Customers are less concerned with the male gaze, she said, and are instead responding to marketing messages promoting self-love and empowerment.
“I don't see it as being a gift that people want to give anymore," she said. “My husband is not going to buy that for me, I want to buy it myself."
Victoria's Secret just "didn't change with the times," said James West, who's worked as a Boston-based lingerie salesman since the '80s and now represents several European brands. Other lingerie brands like Chantelle and Cosabella have proven more nimble, and are increasingly pushing T-shirt bras, wireless bralettes, and larger cup sizes.
“Most of the US brands used to go to a triple D — most of them now are going G and H cups," he said. “Women want to be comfortable."
Younger shoppers are seeking out American Eagle's Aerie line for bras, panties, and sleepwear. The company's #AerieREAL campaign ads feature a full spectrum of body types and use unaltered photos of models like athlete Aly Raisman and actress Busy Philipps.
Noelle Scarlett, 24, who works as an associate at Wayfair, said she's been shopping at Aerie since she was a teen. Their ads “have really authentic, beautiful women of all different shapes and sizes," she said, and their garments are both cute and comfortable.
“I don't want things that are wedged up there," she joked.
When she thinks of Victoria's Secret, said Scarlett, it's all “thin bombshell models with angel wings." Even if they are taking steps to be more inclusive, she said, “they don't showcase it."
L Brands has tried to broaden Victoria's Secret's appeal, hiring transgender and plus-size models and adding two additional women to the parent company's board, which until recently was dominated by white men with a median age of 71. In November, the company canceled its televised fashion show, saying it was rethinking the format. The company's board of directors said in a statement that it's made “significant strides" in recent years in providing “a safe, welcoming, and empowering workplace" for its employees and remains “fully committed to continuous improvement and complete accountability."
In the meantime, upstarts are rushing into the breach. Masha Titova broke into the bra business after working in apparel manufacturing for Los Angeles-based brands like BCBGMAXAZRIA and Kanye West's Yeezy line. But she was frustrated with the substandard options for underwear.
“I kept feeling like I could be doing something better," Titova said. So last June, she moved home to Massachusetts to launch Titov, a line of sexy yet supportive bralettes and underwear designed to fit larger sizes.
Her line, which is manufactured in East Boston, is already gaining traction: It's featured in the UnderClub monthly lingerie subscription box, and Titova held a Valentine's Day pop-up shop this week in Rebecca Minkoff's SoHo store. Titova, 26, has a specific audience in mind for Titov: women of a certain age.
“Women over 45 are neglected in this space. They don't see themselves reflected in any brand because every model is a 22-year-old," she said. She's now partnering with the company Divorceify — which offers support for people ending their marriages — to offer a giveaway for women who are seeking a fresh start.
Women now rank “sexiness" eighth when asked about why they purchase intimates, according to research from The NPD Group. Instead, support and comfort top the list.
"I don't think that Free People or Neiman would have even talked to us unless their teams were like: 'We need to move away from sexy, constrictive garments,' " said Mullan, of Uwila Warrior.
“Our line is all about comfort and fit. The whole idea is that it doesn't come off in five minutes."

McClatchy files for bankruptcy protection

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - McClatchy, the publisher of the Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star and dozens of other newspapers, has filed for bankruptcy protection as it struggles to pay off debt while revenue shrinks because more readers and advertisers are going online.
McClatchy said Thursday that its 30 newspapers will continue to operate normally as it reorganizes under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, helped by $50 million in financing from Encina Business Credit.
The company hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection in a few months as a private company, with majority ownership by a hedge fund that's currently McClatchy's largest shareholder and
Debtholder, Chatham Asset Management. That would end 163 years of family control.
It's also looking to unload its pension obligations to a federal corporation that guarantees pensions, so that employees would get the benefits they were entitled to.
McClatchy did not announce any layoffs and tried to reassure employees, saying that while "we are always looking at opportunities to improve operational efficiencies," the Chapter 11 process is "not geared around cost take-outs."
The newspaper industry has been deeply hurt by changing technology that has sent the vast majority of people online in search of news. Media companies have tried to shift online, with varying degrees of success, as their print ad revenue and circulation declined. Complicating matters, internet companies Facebook and Google receive most online ad dollars.
While some national newspapers, like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, are adding digital subscribers, helping them navigate advertising declines, many
Local outlets have had a difficult time. That has led to a string of consolidation, much of it
Involving investment firms, deepening concerns about declining quality as newsrooms shrink and papers close.
Gannett, the USA Today publisher, was bought last year by GateHouse, a chain managed by private equity firm Fortress, in a deal helped by a high-interest, $1.8 billion loan from another financial firm, Apollo. It is the largest newspaper chain in the
U.S. Another large chain,
MediaNews, is owned by a hedge fund with a reputation for cutting costs and jobs,
Alden Global.
McClatchy said it remained committed to journalism.
"When local media suffers in the face of industry challenges, communities suffer: polarization grows, civic connections fray and borrowing costs rise for local governments," CEO Craig Forman said. "We are moving with speed and focus to benefit all our stakeholders and our communities."
In a statement, Chatham said it was "committed to preserving independent journalism and newsroom jobs." Chatham said it has been "a supportive investor" in McClatchy since 2009.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders's victory in New Hampshire on top of his tie in Iowa makes him a favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Hard to believe, but in a winnable race against President Trump the opposition may nominate a socialist who wants the government to control energy production and health care, who wants nationwide rent control, and who calls America a "racist society from top to bottom." No wonder Democrats like James Carville are in agony.
The Vermont revolutionary's victory portends a long primary battle, unless Democratic voters elevate a single mainstream candidate who can challenge him. Mr. Sanders will get his 25% to 30% primary after primary, racking up delegates on his way to the convention. If other candidates keep dividing the other votes, he will be hard to stop, as Mr. Trump was for Republicans in 2016. Even if a single alternative emerges, Mr. Sanders won't go down without a ferocious intra-party fight.
***
How did this happen? How did Mr. Sanders move from the socialist fringe to the brink of controlling the Democratic Party? The Senator's dogged persistence across decades and especially the last four years is part of the explanation.
Yet Mr. Sanders wouldn't be this close to the White House if not for the complicity of Democrats and the liberals who dominate the academy and media. Rather than fighting the ideas that animate him and his millennial voters, they have indulged and promoted them. They created the political environment in which he could prosper. Consider the intellectual currents he is riding:
• The attack on capitalism and markets. Like Tony Blair in Britain, Bill Clinton's New Democrats accommodated the economic lessons of Ronald Reagan. By the Obama Presidency, all that had changed. The left blamed markets for the 2008 panic and crash—not failed government regulation, subsidies for bad housing risks, or too loose monetary policy.
Then came the socialist intellectual comeback led by French economists Thomas Piketty ("Capital"), Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Inequality replaced growth as the top economic policy concern. The economists resurrected the anti-market ideas and tax policies of the 1930s, and they were celebrated by the Democratic press. Occupy Wall Street became the street version of this movement and was praised by no less than Barack Obama.
It's a short ideological hop from there to 60% marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, the demonization of billionaires, and equating business success with "corruption," as Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren do. Millennials heard Democrats assail "the rich" for years, but Bernie has the courage of their pretensions.
• The rise of left-wing intolerance on campus. From the late 1960s on, the political left flooded into the academy and rewrote the curriculum to fit its ideological fashions. American history was dogmatized, often according to the work of Howard Zinn. The Western canon was purged. Conservatives resisted but lost as liberals accommodated the revolution.
First the humanities, then the social sciences and now even the sciences have been forced to bend to identity politics. Race, gender, class and sexual orientation became preoccupations in scholarship and tenure. This is the academic culture that nurtured millennials and Gen Z to believe in microaggressions and the "cancel culture" that now torments Democrats who disagree.
• The critique of America as irredeemably racist. Identity politics took an especially sharp turn on race with the police shootings of 2014 and 2015. Black Lives Matter erupted and demanded that politicians bow to its concerns. No Democrat has dared to challenge it, or to defend 50 years of racial progress or the reduction in crime that has saved black lives.
Author Ta-Nehisi Coates became the darling of white liberals with his castigation of America as systemically racist. The New York Times has tried to replace 1776 with the 1619 arrival of the first slaves to North America as a racist America's founding event.
• Climate change as religion, not science. A generation of apocalyptic climate education has made what was a matter of temperatures and scientific modeling into a cultural identity. No dissent is tolerated, and the solutions must be radical and immediate. Mr. Sanders was quick to sense the political possibility and grab onto the Green New Deal.
***
These are among the beliefs feeding the radicalism and resentment of the Sanders campaign. Bernie started his political career as a Marxist focusing on the economic class struggle. But he has adapted to these other intellectual streams, and this year he has adopted identity politics with a fervor that out-woked Julián Castro and Kamala Harris.
Yet rather than challenge Mr. Sanders, the other candidates have given him a pass on everything besides Medicare for All. They have adopted his tax and redistribution arguments, if not all his policies. They mimic his denunciations of America as racist.
With the exception of Joe Biden, they have also accepted his anti-interventionist foreign policy. The press corps has almost seemed to cheer Mr. Biden's collapse in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet now the Democratic media find themselves fearing that Mr. Sanders might win the nomination and lose to Mr. Trump. Their refusal to challenge the political left makes them Bernie's accomplices.
The tragedy is that this year, even more than most years, the country needs a sensible and centrist opposition party and nominee. Millions of Americans like the results of Mr. Trump's policies but not his divisive brand of politics and personal behavior. They are looking for an alternative who doesn't scare them. The agony of the Democrats is that years of bowing to the left means they may nominate someone who makes Mr. Trump look like the safer choice.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , for president, and will be working as a surrogate of the campaign, a source familiar told USA TODAY Friday.
The New York Times was first to report the endorsement.
De Blasio had a short stint of his own on the campaign trail running for president in 2019 when he sought the Democratic nomination.
However, he ended his bid just a few months after announcing his candidacy, saying, "I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election and it's clearly not my time so I'm going to end my presidential campaign. "
'A plan to fight back': How Elizabeth Warren stumbled in New Hampshire and her plan for 'the long haul'
The mayor will be traveling to Nevada with the Sanders' campaign this weekend, ahead of next week's caucuses, including at a Sunday event in Carson City.
The source also told USA TODAY that the plan is for de Blasio to travel with the campaign to other parts of the country, but those places are "undetermined" at the moment.
In a statement obtained originally by CNN, Sen. Sanders said of the endorsement, "Jane and I grew up in Brooklyn and we are so proud to have the support of a New York City Mayor fighting every day to improve the lives of New Yorkers. Bill is a leading example of what bringing the Democratic Party together around so-called 'radical ideas' like universal pre-K, paid family and sick leave, and defending immigrant neighbors can do for our country. "
In 2019, while he was still running for the Democratic nomination, De Blasio said he thought Sanders would have won the presidential election in 2016 if he were the party's nominee instead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"In my heart, yeah," the mayor answered to POLITICO at the time. "You know, hindsight’s 20/20, but I think when we look at it now, that was a moment where there was such desire for change. "
A statement sent to supports from the Sanders' campaign said that de Blasio is "standing with Bernie because he stands with working families, and always has. ”
"New Yorkers know all too well the damage caused by Donald Trump’s xenophobia, bigotry and recklessness, and Bernie is the candidate to take him on and take him down. I have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that’s exactly what Senator Sanders has championed for decades. I am proud to endorse a true progressive leader who will fight for working New Yorkers and families across the country,” the statement continued.
The two have kept in communication since the mayor ended his campaign in September, and have had a public relationship the past few years. In 2018, de Blasio was sworn in for his final term with Sanders administering the oath of office.
The endorsement of Sanders comes on the heels of the Vermont senator having strong showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.

Bloomberg Buys the Democratic Elite; Putting dollar signs in the eyes of activists is not the same as catching fire with the voting public.

Texto completo: If one news outlet had the manpower and mind-set to dig cynically into the many ways Mike Bloomberg is spending his money to become president, it would be Bloomberg News—if it weren't owned by Mike Bloomberg.
Bloomberg News has always been a follow-the-money kind of news organization. It never needed a common-man theme to justify it. Mr. Bloomberg's giant spending isn't just buying ads, it's driving up ad rates to make it harder for other Democratic candidates to get their messages out, it's buying up campaign talent so they can't, it's corralling Democratic Party influentials to endorse his candidacy or at least mute any noisy criticism of his effort.
When a recording leaked of Mr. Bloomberg defending stop-and-frisk in New York, Andre Fields of the liberal voting-rights group Fair Fight Action rushed out a tweet hitting him as a "true terrorist" but promptly deleted it. Fair Fight Action had received $5 million in funding from Mr. Bloomberg. Three members of the Congressional Black Caucus helped out with timely endorsements of a man who spent at least $90 million on House Democratic races in the last 19 months.
New York Times columnist Tom Friedman on Wednesday joined in with 1,500 words implying that other Democratic candidates should make way for Mr. Bloomberg. He ended his piece with a disclosure that his wife's charity was supported with Bloomberg donations.
Mr. Bloomberg has said he will spend $1 billion through Election Day. If so, he will have to curb his outlays to meet his target. At $344 million, he's already spent more on advertising than the Clinton and Trump campaigns did in all of 2016.
I wouldn't put it the way his left-wing critics do—that he's trying to buy the nomination or the presidency. He's trying to buy the Democratic Party elite. He's distorting the incentives of activists, officials and campaign fixers who suddenly are thinking less about a presidential victory and more about getting on or staying on the Bloomberg gravy train.
He entered the race, remember, because Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were too left-wing to beat Donald Trump, but he only strengthens Mr. Sanders by giving him a foil for his message of billionaire corruption of politics. Mr. Bloomberg's dominance of the airwaves will not help things shake out in the centrist lane. A tiny fraction of his current spending might be intelligently employed to give Amy Klobuchar a boost. Instead, he's in danger of becoming a pro-Sanders spoiler.
Mr. Bloomberg would make a competent president but the question is moot. Mr. Trump's voters aren't going to abandon him. The Democratic left would see Mr. Bloomberg as a repudiation of everything it hoped to achieve in 2020. Mr. Bloomberg's belief that there's an anti-Trump majority just waiting to coalesce around his earnest self is a variation on the miscalculation that has so many Democrats thinking this is the year for Medicare for All. Democrats have consistently overestimated what Mr. Trump's "unpopularity" can deliver them in 2020. Mr. Bloomberg is making the same mistake.
His ads might have moved him from 3% to 10% in the polls but ads have sharply diminishing returns. They make people aware of a product. They don't make them buy it. After three viewings, viewers tune them out. Mr. Bloomberg could try handing $10 bills to voters but U.S. law and tradition frown on this. It's the other element of his spending, meanwhile, that has toxic potential for the Democratic Party—the sight of so many party stalwarts dropping everything for a financial opportunity for themselves.
The idea that Mr. Bloomberg has any catch-fire potential in the larger electorate is the ultimate flaw in the scenario. At least if they lose with Bernie, Democrats will be able to respect themselves in the morning.
The potted story line is that Mr. Trump envied Mr. Bloomberg his genuine entrepreneurial accomplishments and his bigger fortune, but it turned out it was Mr. Trump who got up and did what Mr. Bloomberg has been mooning about for two decades—run for president and win.
Mr. Bloomberg is the man who wants to be invited, who wants to be seen stepping forward because the people summoned him. Mr. Trump invited himself—and was surprised by the result. His imitators shouldn't kid themselves about this. A genuinely enthusiastic section of the electorate ran away with the GOP in 2016. Mr. Trump provided the message; in no sense was its reception orchestrated by him. On the contrary, he didn't have to spend money on ads.
If Mr. Bloomberg can run away with the Democratic Party in 2020, it will be for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Trump's was a revolution of the grass roots. Mr. Bloomberg's would be a revolution of a paid-off elite.

Author Gives Presentation On Handling Bullying At Nativity

Texto completo: POTTSVILLE - For many students, bullying is something that they have to deal with in addition to the normal curriculum of the school day and outside world, many times with pain and loneliness.
The cafeteria at Nativity BVM High School had many people attending a one-hour talk on the important subject of bullying on Tuesday evening from Jodee Blanco, one of the country’s preeminent voices on the subject, something that she speaks not only as an expert, but also as a survivor of bullying.
She is the author of The New York Times bestselling memoir “Please Stop Laughing At Me… One Woman’s Inspirational Story,” which chronicles her years as the student outcast and has inspired a movement among bullying victims everywhere of all ages - in middle and high schools, on college campuses, at the workplace and at home.
Blanco has been giving a series of presentations for parents and children at Catholic schools around the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown. All programs are free and open to the public.
During her presentation, Blanco said parents must approach their children about bullying in ways that can be best understood to them, not necessarily as an adult would understand, referring to her own experiences.
“Every time a well-meaning grown-up would say that to me, I would scream inside my head, ‘Who cares about why I don’t fit in? Who cares the reason why? I don’t want anymore dumb grown-up explanations. All adults ever do is think and explain. I don’t want explanations, I want actions. Just tell me what to do so I can get invited to that party on Friday,’ ” Blanco said.
She added that the victims are told that they need to be better than the bullies, that they should rise above them and be better without expecting better behavior from the bullies.
“How come nobody ever expects the mean kids to rise above anything,” Blanco said. “Isn’t it bad enough we’re under all this pressure just going to have to go to school and hope we’re not going to get humiliated? Now on top of it, we have to rise above what is happening to us or at least pretend to, and if we don’t, we’re going to disappoint the adults on top of the kids not liking us. Why is all of that pressure on us and not them?”
According to the National Bullying Prevention Center:
 More than one out of every five (20.8%) students report being bullied (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2016).
 The federal government began collecting data on school bullying in 2005, when the prevalence of bullying was around 28% (U.S. Department of Education, 2015).
 Rates of bullying vary across studies (from 9% to 98%). A meta-analysis of 80 studies analyzing bullying involvement rates (for both bullying others and being bullied) for 12-18-year-old students reported a mean prevalence rate of 35% for traditional bullying involvement and 15% for cyberbullying involvement.
 Studies show that 33% of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that they were bullied at least once or twice a month during the school year.
 Of those students who reported being bullied, 13% were made fun of, called names or insulted; 12% were the subject of rumors; 5% were pushed, shoved, tripped or spit on; and 5% were excluded from activities on purpose.
According to the Center for Disease Control, students who are bullied are more likely to experience low self-esteem and isolation, perform poorly in school, have few friends in school, have a negative view of school, experience physical symptoms, such as headaches, stomach aches or problems sleeping and to experience mental health issues, such as depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.

High-tech Tires Roll From Pit Lane To Your Garage

Texto completo: Add one more to the list of “smart” things we’ve come to know in recent years: the smart tire.
For the longest time - more than a century - tires were just rubber doughnuts. In later years, tires got an edge, called a bead, that held it to the wheel’s rim. But conventional tires are not without their flaws. With little if any warning to the driver, tires puncture, rip, skid on water and ice, lose pressure or abruptly go flat in the left lane on the George Washington Bridge. At rush hour. They are anything but smart.
Enter the Pirelli Cyber Tire, a high-tech component stuffed with advanced sensors that can radio information and warnings to an electronic receptor in an automobile’s cockpit. If the car is slipping in a puddle, the tire knows. If traction is being lost, the tire knows. The information can warn the driver to make corrections, or, in some cases, “tell” the car’s control unit to adjust engine speed, traction control or other settings.
The devices are capable of “talking” to a 5G wireless network, allowing them to communicate with drivers in other receiver-equipped vehicles or, for example, a wireless infrastructure at a racetrack.
And if there’s no driver in the car?
“Our system would add the ‘touching’ dimension to the visual in autonomous driving,” said Corrado Rocca, head of research and development for Pirelli’s smart tire project. “For example, you can imagine that an auto is receiving information from the road about how to avoid an obstacle or pedestrian, telling it, ‘Slow down.’ It will complement the visual data from cameras - from lidar, sonar, radar. It is the next step.”
The implanted sensor, as Rocca describes it, is shaped like a small sombrero, about the size of a quarter, and contains a processor, a radio and communications electronics. Using sophisticated software, it relays data to the car’s engine control unit, also known as an engine control module. Pirelli is planning to offer performance-car owners in the United States an aftermarket cockpit-mounted device that, paired with sensors in the company’s high-end Trofeo tires, can communicate information about tire condition, lap timing and track positioning.
“We are also talking with a number of car manufacturers about integrating the systems, but it’s a lengthy process, three to five years,” Rocca said. “It’s not only adding our technology but integrating it with all the software” in place in the cars.
Pirelli recently tested an Audi fitted with the Cyber Tires. Rocca said it was able to transmit information through a 5G network to another car about wet road conditions.
At the moment, plans for the Cyber Tire in racing environments are vague, although it would seem that Formula One cars would be the ideal test bed. For the next three years, Pirelli is the sole supplier of tires for all Formula One teams under a contract with the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, Formula One’s governing body. Such an arrangement is not unusual: Michelin supplies tires for all teams in the Formula E electric-car racing series, and the company is working with a tire sensor for those cars that monitors air pressure.
“There are stringent rules in Formula One, rules of the game that are outside our scope today,” Rocca said. “We are not focused on that now. But in the future ... .” He let the sentence hang.
Pirelli is pursuing other advancements in tire development for mainstream vehicles, including issues of materials, weight and road noise, and thermal behavior. One instance of racing tech migrating to road use is the simple bead that fixes the rubber to the rim.
“There are huge stresses on the rim and the tire in Formula One,” said Mario Isola, who heads Pirelli’s racing program.
At the end of the day, winning a race is one thing; putting that technology to work in road cars - and selling lots of those cars - is quite another.
“I can tell you that companies like Mercedes, Renault, they’re not in Formula One just because they love the sport,” said Mario Andretti, who stopped to chat while walking the pit lane at the recent Formula One race in Austin, Texas. Andretti won the 1978 Formula One World Championship, as well as four IndyCar titles, including the Indianapolis 500.

Texto completo: Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from across the Golden State and the country. From Palm Springs, Calif. , I’m Mark Olalde.
Recently, we’ve had a few chilly days out here in the desert. (It is winter, after all. ) But it turns out I could’ve gone to Antarctica to warm up. With the temperature hitting 65 degrees Fahrenheit, Antarctica saw what is likely its highest temperature ever recorded. USA Today has more on this frightening development and how formerly unthinkable temperatures have 87% of glaciers along the region’s west coast retreating over the past half-century.
Did you think last week had too much news for one newsletter? Well, this week has been just as hectic, but here’s a quick overview of some other important reporting….
MUST-READ STORIES
Thirsty for growth. Buckeye, a suburb of Phoenix, is the country’s fastest-growing city, but such urban sprawl comes at a steep price when you’re in the desert. The town’s mayor admitted to The Arizona Republic that he doesn’t know from where the necessary water will come. So, what happens when a short-term stopgap becomes a long-term answer it was never meant to be? Take a read.
Remember my name. The Los Angeles Times’ Emily Alpert Reyes is out with a chilling profile of a teenage activist named Nalleli Cobo who has spent half her life fighting for environmental causes after she developed nosebleeds as a child, potentially from leaking oil wells across the street from her home. Now she’s been diagnosed with cancer, although her fight goes on. She recently told a rally to remember her because one day she’ll be asking for their votes.
A fertile market. In a new deep dive, The Washington Post reveals how the illegal pesticide trade has exploded over the past 20 years. These chemicals, and their sales and overuse, are a slow-moving environmental and health catastrophe that has proven to be especially pernicious in the developing world.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
A plan full of holes. Nearly a year ago, the head of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency promised an imminent rollback of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards on new cars. But, Coral Davenport of The New York Times reports, drafts of the yet-to-be-published rule are, shall we say, a mess. I would do a disservice to paraphrase, so I’ll leave it to her reporting. “Six people familiar with the documents described them as ‘Swiss cheese,’ sprinkled with glaring numerical and spelling errors (such as ‘Massachusettes’), with 111 sections marked ‘text forthcoming,’” she wrote.
What’s going on in there? The U. S. Department of the Interior has repeatedly found itself in hot water during President Donald Trump’s tenure. With Democrats controlling the House, the fight continues to investigate controversial decisions in the agencies that manage the country’s public lands. The House Natural Resources Committee conferred subpoena powers on its chair, Arizona Democrat Rep. Raul Grijalva, on Wednesday, Bloomberg reports.
Blowing up the border. U. S. Customs and Border Protection has been blasting apart a mountain on protected land in Arizona as it clears the area, including stripping part of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, to make way for an extension of the border wall. The Intercept reports on the developments that some members of Congress are decrying as “sacrilegious. ”
POWER TO THE STATES
Painting the state green. California already has an aggressive clean energy mandate — carbon neutral by 2045 — and efforts are underway to meet that goal. In Palm Springs, for example, the city is rolling out a plan that’s asking residents to accept a hike on their electricity bill in exchange for a big change to their carbon footprint. But, not all decarbonization plans are moving forward in the Golden State. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $1 billion fund to dole out green loans, but in a report released Thursday, Kevin Stark of KQED reports, a nonpartisan state advisory agency came out against the idea.
Appalachian power play. From coal deposits to the Ohio River, Appalachia has a complex history that’s inextricably intertwined with its natural resources. In Tennessee, InsideClimate News and the Knoxville News Sentinel report, a fight over a coal mine permit “pits Republicans against Republicans” because many stakeholders believe it would be illegal to grant the permit. The Trump administration is considering approving it. Virginia, however, has been shifting blue in recent years, and its energy policy reflected that this week. Both houses of Virginia’s Legislature passed the Clean Economy Act, which sets a goal of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2045 or 2050, depending on which chamber’s bill prevails, the AP reports.
AND ANOTHER THING
Howl at the moon. Our friends over at The Arizona Republic take us on a detailed tour of the annual Mexican gray wolf count, which is a collaboration among federal, state and tribal authorities. The apex predators, which are known to roam Arizona and New Mexico, are endangered but slowly rebounding.
Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We’re above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor to review the criminal case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing in federal court after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, an official familiar with the matter said Friday.
Barr has tapped Jeffrey Jensen, the chief federal prosecutor in St. Louis nominated by President Donald Trump in 2017, to conduct the review.
The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly, said Jensen was selected weeks ago. As part of his review, Jensen will look into concerns raised by Flynn's defense team about the investigation of the former Army general.
Flynn and his attorneys have sought to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming the FBI and federal prosecutors engaged in misconduct. But Jensen's review is not to be considered an attempt to undermine Flynn's prosecution, the official said.
“This should not be taken as a signal that there is an investigation of the prosecutors. They are working together,” the official said.
Flynn's case was one of the first criminal charges brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.
Defender-in-chief: With DOJ's intervention in Roger Stone case, William Barr cements his role as Trump's ally
Barr's decision to review the case, first reported by The New York Times, caps off a contentious week for the Justice Department. The department already faces allegations of succumbing to political pressure from Trump; the development in the Flynn case is certain to raise more questions about the agency's independence.
The Justice Department unleashed an uproar earlier this week after it intervened to reduce its recommended prison sentence for Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of Trump who was convicted of seven felonies, including lying to Congress.
Career prosecutors who handled the case had asked for a sentence of seven to nine years in prison, which Trump said was a "miscarriage of justice. "
The Justice Department overruled the attorneys, saying the prison recommendation was too harsh. The prosecutors withdrew from Stone's case in apparent protest. One resigned from the Justice Department.
In an interview with ABC News, Barr pushed back against criticism that he was doing Trump's bidding. The president "has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case," he said.
But the developments have placed the Justice Department's leadership, particularly Barr, under a harsh spotlight. Democrats have accused Barr of meddling in criminal cases for political purposes and have called him to testify before Congress.
With a new prosecution team assigned to Stone's case and Flynn's prosecution under review, it was not immediately clear how many other cases would be pulled for additional scrutiny.
Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his communication with Sergey Kislyak, a former Russian ambassador to the U. S. , in the weeks before Trump took office.
Barr speaks out: Trump's tweets make it 'impossible for me to do my job'
Flynn's case has been stalled in federal court for two years as his defense team alleges he was framed in a government conspiracy. Last month, Flynn withdrew his guilty plea, accusing prosecutors of acting in "bad faith" during their investigation.
His defense team, led by conservative lawyer and Fox News commentator Sidney Powell, declared his innocence. Flynn's attorneys accused the government of forcing him to admit to crimes he didn't commit and hiding evidence that would've exonerated him.
A federal judge has rejected those claims. In court filings this week, prosecutors said Flynn has failed to identify any specific government misconduct that would call for his case to be dismissed.
Flynn's attorneys did not respond to calls seeking comment Friday.
The government initially recommended Flynn be sentenced to six months in prison, citing his attempts to "thwart" prosecutors and his "apparent failure to accept responsibility. "
Federal prosecutors later softened their position, suggesting that probation is also an "appropriate" sentence for Flynn.
Roger Stone: Four career prosecutors are the target of Trump's anger. Here's how they came up with a stiff sentence for Roger Stone.
Barr's decision to tap Jensen to review the case comes as the Justice Department conducts another politically charged inquiry into the origins of the Russia probe, which cast a cloud over the first years of the Trump presidency.
That inquiry, which Barr launched last year, focuses on whether federal investigators abused their surveillance authority in the initial stages of the Russia investigation. John Durham, Connecticut's chief federal prosecutor, is leading the review.
Jensen served as an FBI agent for 10 years and as an assistant U. S. attorney for another 10 years before going into private practice in 2009. Trump nominated him to be St. Louis' top federal prosecutor in July 2017. He was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017.
Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asked Barr to make Justice Department employees available for interviews as part of the committee's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe and the FBI's surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.
In a letter to Barr on Friday, Graham listed several FBI and Justice Department officials the committee wants to interview.
Also this week, the Justice Department decided not to file criminal charges against former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, one of several former FBI officials who have been the target of Trump's attacks.
The investigation into McCabe stemmed from a Justice Department inspector general’s report that found he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Justice Department will not file criminal charges in a leak investigation of Andrew McCabe, ending an investigation that has hung over the former deputy FBI director for two years.
"Based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the Government at this time, we consider the matter closed," the U. S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia told McCabe's attorneys in a letter Friday.
The decision comes amid allegations that the Justice Department has bowed to pressure from President Donald Trump, most recently by reversing course on the recommended sentence for Trump ally Roger Stone.
Trump attacked the career prosecutors who handled Stone's case after they asked a judge to sentence the longtime GOP operative to seven to nine years in prison. The Justice Department backtracked, and the entire prosecution team quit in apparent protest.
On Thursday, Barr said Trump did not ask him to intervene in the case.
Roger Stone sentencing: With DOJ's intervention in Roger Stone case, William Barr cements his role as Trump's defender-in-chief
"I am not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody . . . whether it's Congress, a newspaper editorial board or the president," Barr said in an ABC News interview. "I'm gonna do what I think is right. I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me. "
Trump has called for the prosecution of several former FBI officials, including McCabe. He opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump in 2017, after the president fired FBI director James Comey.
At the time, Comey was leading an investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.
McCabe, a CNN contributor, told the cable channel he's looking forward to celebrating with family and friends.
More: Andrew McCabe 'confident' top lawmakers understood FBI had launched probe into President Trump
"It's been so unbelievably tense and just such an incredible pressure on all of us," McCabe said. "We're all very, very happy. I'm just so glad my kids don't have to live with this anymore. "
He said the announcement would allow him to continue to comment on government actions.
"I am enjoying finally having the opportunity to speak publicly about things that I believe deeply in, about concerns that we all have about our country, and the way things are going," said McCabe, whom former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired just hours before his retirement in March 2018.
McCabe has since sued the Justice Department over his firing, accusing officials of unjustly demoting and terminating him to cater to Trump's "unlawful whims. "
Defender-in-chief: With DOJ's intervention in Roger Stone case, William Barr cements his role as Trump's defender-in-chief
McCabe inquiry focused on leak about Clinton Foundation investigation
The investigation into McCabe stemmed from a Justice Department Inspector General’s report that found he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.
McCabe, who became acting FBI director after Trump fired Comey in May 2017, has been a frequent target of the president's attacks. Trump contends law enforcement officials launched partisan investigations of him, his campaign and his administration. Those probes have led to convictions of a half-dozen of Trump's onetime aides and advisers.
Trump applauded Sessions' decision to fire McCabe, calling it "a great day for democracy. ” Trump has argued McCabe's conduct was akin to treason, claiming he favored Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic opponent for president in 2016.
One of several investigations into wrongdoing by top FBI officials
Friday's decision caps a series of accusations of wrongdoing by the FBI's top leaders in 2016. Internal investigators have faulted McCabe and Comey for violating Justice Department rules in the final months of an election in which federal agents were investigating both major-party candidates. Lower-level FBI staffers were fired or reassigned.
The Justice Department announced in August that Comey had violated FBI policies for keeping private memos about his conversations with Trump and then having a friend describe the contents of some of them to The New York Times. But the department didn't charge Comey with a crime.
McCabe was fired after the inspector general investigated whether a Wall Street Journal story about the Clinton Foundation resulted from an unauthorized leak and if so, who leaked it. The story appeared online Oct. 30, 2016, and in print the next day, which was a week after another story reported that McCabe had terminated the foundation probe under pressure from the Justice Department.
Investigators determined that McCabe authorized associates to tell The Wall Street Journal about an Aug. 12 call between him and the principal associate deputy attorney general. The call effectively confirmed the existence of the Clinton Foundation investigation, which Comey had refused to do.
McCabe allowed the release of that information in order to show he was impartial regarding the Clinton Foundation investigation, even as his wife accepted a campaign contribution from a Clinton ally.
More: Former FBI official Andrew McCabe sues over his firing, says he was ousted to satisfy Trump's 'unlawful whims'
The inspector general found McCabe “lacked candor” when he said he hadn't authorized the disclosure and didn't know who did. This happened several times, including when McCabe talked to Comey, when he was questioned under oath by FBI agents, and when he was questioned under oath by investigators for former special counsel Robert Mueller.
Trump called McCabe “a major sleazebag” and has said he took “massive amounts of money” for his wife’s unsuccessful Democratic campaign for state Senate in Virginia.
Trump was referring to contributions Jill McCabe received from a political action committee tied to former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally.
But internal FBI documents showed that McCabe didn't oversee the Clinton Foundation investigation while his wife was running for office, and he didn't have a conflict of interest.
The decision about McCabe follows inquiries into how the Justice Department and the FBI initiated investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Barr assigned one internal probe in May.
In December, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded the FBI's surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page was riddled with errors, but said the FBI was justified in launching its inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Texto completo: After the Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire, The New York Times asked 10 of its opinion writers to score the candidates’ performances. The hands-down winner: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
But you wouldn’t know that from news reports. Across print, digital, broadcast and cable, coverage of the debate overwhelmingly focused on the battle of the bros: Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden. Klobuchar barely merited a mention. The Times itself treated her as a footnote, declaring in a front-page article that “there were no standout moments” in a debate that might be Klobuchar’s “final” chance (though the next day it belatedly noted her “Klomentum” — on page A27).
When Klobuchar finished strong, with a third-place finish closing in on the top two winners, news outlets trumpeted her “sudden surge” as a “big surprise. ” Actually, no, it wasn’t. It was a failure of basic news reporting.
Sexism in the news media
Why the disconnect? The news media still has a woman problem. Female candidates routinely get less attention and are taken less seriously than male candidates.
A recent Wilson Center study found that “the coverage women in politics receive is still heavily biased against them, both in quantity and in quality. ”
The coverage they do get tends to be more negative: Northeastern University School of Journalism last spring analyzed almost 1,400 news articles from mainstream outlets and found that “female candidates running for president are consistently being described in the media more negatively than their male counterparts. ”
Perhaps this shouldn’t be surprising. News coverage decisions are overwhelmingly made by men, who lead the vast majority of newsrooms. Women make up two-thirds of journalism and communications grads, yet men write or produce 63% of all news coverage, according to the Women’s Media Center. On television, male journalists outnumber female journalists by almost 2 to 1. On Twitter, male political reporters ignore female reporters altogether; they retweet fellow male journalists three times more often than they retweet female journalists.
In other words, the male perspective is the default in the news business. The female is the outlier — which often translates into women simply being ignored. A British analysis concluded that more than 75% of “experts” quoted in digital news accounts are male. In the United States, more than 70% of Sunday morning politics and policy talk show guests are male.
One study of English-language news sites globally found that 77% of those mentioned in articles are men, and that women are “routinely marginalized or ‘symbolically annihilated’ in the news. ”
Clay Aiken on 2020 primary: Why I'm changing my vote from Biden to Klobuchar
Think about that for a moment: Women are “symbolically annihilated” by the media. Klobuchar isn’t the only example of this; she’s simply the most recent one.
After the Iowa caucuses, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was “virtually erased” from news coverage despite beating Biden for the third-place spot, Joan Walsh argued in The Nation. “I have watched cable news panels mention Warren only in passing, if at all. ”
The issue cuts across political lines. Female journalists started The 19th, a new nonpartisan publication covering the intersection of gender and politics, because women are “underrepresented in politics and policy journalism and in newsroom leadership. ”
Women are either ignored or pilloried
The problem is, the news media — of which I’ve been a part for more than three decades — actually knows it’s kind of sexist but can’t seem to help itself. When women aren’t being ignored in news coverage, they’re being pilloried.
Back when former secretary of State Hilary Clinton was a presidential contender, coverage by mainstream news outlets was relentlessly gendered. She was “unlikable. ” She was an “angry woman. ” She had “cankles. ” She was “shrill” and “castrating” and reminded men of their “nagging wives. ”
You would think the media has learned since then to scrub the sexism from its prose. It hasn’t. Witness descriptions of Klobuchar as the “boss from hell,” and Warren as “unlikable” and a “moralizing scold. ”
Clearly, there are other issues at play here, beyond gender. Political coverage, like reporting on Hollywood, is by nature pack journalism, populated by an often tight-knit group of reporters who talk with one another, travel with one another, and compete for the coveted access to the highly scripted people they cover. Too often, the end result is group think: A mass-derived conventional wisdom that blocks out noncomforming views, and sometimes — as in 2016, when the media missed the rise of Donald Trump — even blinds us to what we are seeing in front of our faces.
Klobuchar's empathy: Trump is fueling an empathy crisis in America. Can Klobuchar win by running on the e-word?
We suffer as well from an overreliance on polls. The polls were wrong in 2016, when almost all predicted a Clinton landslide, and there is no evidence that they are any more accurate now. If anything, they might be even less so. Before the Iowa caucuses, polls showed Sanders and Biden running neck and neck, with Sanders given the edge. Of course, neither won, with Buttigieg besting them both and Biden tanking in fourth place.
None of this is to suggest that Klobuchar will, or won’t, continue her “surge. ” That isn’t the point. This is: Her strong finish shouldn’t have been a “surprise. ” Journalism is the first draft of history, which we all know is imperfect — but we can, and must, do better. We need to be cognizant of biases that continue to infect our reporting. We need to move beyond a world where the default newsworthy person is male, the default expert is male, the default leader is male.
Women make up the majority of U. S. voters. It’s time they have a proportional say in news coverage, too.

Texto completo: HOT PICK
Saturday Funk: The Riverside County Fair & National Date Festival in Indio will be headlined by a funk legend.
Originally a soul group in Plainfield, New Jersey in the late '50s, The Parliaments had a hit with "(I Wanna) Testify" in 1967. But they shifted to playing a style of music similar to rock 'n' roll artists Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa — combined with R&B groups Sly and the Family Stone and James Brown — and became Parliament Funkadelic.
Clinton took on an eccentric personality similar to jazz musician Sun Ra of being from outer space, complete with dreadlocks, and the band also created unique personalities and stage costumes of their own. A stage full of musicians, backup dancers and vocalists along with a spaceship became part of their live shows.
"Beavis and Butthead" and "King of the Hill" animator and writer Mike Judge featured an episode on Clinton during the second season of his Cinemax-animated music-biopic series "Tales From the Tour Bus." Clinton openly discussed his wild stage shows, his struggles with drug addiction and the origin story of his popular song "Atomic Dog."
In 2018, Clinton said he would retire from touring but has continued to perform beyond his original target date of last year.
George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Saturday, 7:30 p.m., Riverside County Fair & National Date Festival, 82-503 Highway 111, Indio. $10 for adults, $9 for seniors, $8 for youth, $8 for group tickets and bus tours (minimum of 25). 800-811-FAIR
Best Bets
Friday-Saturday Sinatra: Bob Anderson, who is noted as the No. 1 celebrity impersonator in the world by VH1 and People Magazine, is a master of spot-on impressions. He'll bring his show "Frank - The Man...The Music," honoring the musical legacy of Frank Sinatra and his contribution to the Great American Songbook, to the McCallum Theatre this weekend.
One of Anderson's famous stories is that he snuck into a dress rehearsal of Nancy Sinatra's two-week run of shows at Sahara's Congo Room in Las Vegas in 1973. Her opening act, the Everly Brothers, got into an argument and Anderson stepped in and told the musical conductor he was a singer. The conductor handed him a microphone to prove himself and he replaced the Everly Brothers for the entire two weeks.
"Frank - The Man...The Music," Friday, 8 p.m., Saturday, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., McCallum Theatre, 73-000 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert. $38 to $98. 760-340-2787
Friday Title: If you combined Janis Joplin, Florence Welch and Courtney Barnett, you'd have Lauren Ruth Ward. She's won accolades from Noisey, Consequence of Sound and the Los Angeles Times as she's played to sold-out crowds in the U.S. and overseas.
She's performed with Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Shirley Manson of Garbage and country star Keith Urban.
Lauren Ruth Ward, 7 p.m., Friday, Pappy and Harriet's, 53-688 Pioneertown Rd., Pioneertown. $16. 760-365-5956
Saturday R&B: Charlie Wilson, along with his two brothers Charlie and Ronnie, rose to fame as The Gap Band during the '70s and '80s, playing a form of R&B mixed with funk music. They're most remembered for their 1982 song "You Dropped a Bomb on Me," which is played at sporting events.
The Gap Band retired in 2010, but Wilson had started a solo career in the early '90s that took off in 2000. He has 10 No. 1 singles and 13 Grammy Award nominations, and he released his New York Times bestselling memoir "I Am Charlie Wilson" in 2015.
Charlie Wilson, Saturday, 8 p.m., Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, 84-245 Indio Springs Pkwy., Indio. $49 to $89. 760-342-5000
Saturday Tribute band: Black Crystal Wolf Kids aren't just an indie-rock tribute band. They're an over-the-top indie-rock tribute band covering songs from LCD Soundsystem and The Killers to Lizzo and Billie Eilish. Members of Cage the Elephant and Lord Huron have even sat in with the Los Angeles band during performances.
Also on the bill is the Queen of the High Desert, Jesika von Rabbit, playing her blend of calypso, sci-fi, psychedelic, rock, electro and funk
Black Crystal Wolf Kids, Saturday, 8:30 p.m., The Alibi Palm Springs, 369 N. Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs. $15. 760-656-1525

Texto completo: Whenever I would teach Guam history, the name Janet Benshoof would always come up. It was a name that was notorious for a short period in the early 1990s, and one that probably deserves more attention.
Benshoof was the ACLU attorney who came to Guam to lead the fight against the then strictest anti-choice, anti-abortion law (Public Law 134-20) within the U.S. and its territories.
She was the only person arrested under this law, which made national headlines for not only restricting the rights of a woman to a legal abortion, but also criminalizing speech about abortion. Benshoof passed away in 2017. Her obituary from the New York Times even features a quote from former Gov. Joseph Ada.
This event represents a fascinating moment where we can see the potential conflicts between different ideological frameworks for understanding rights and identity.
Guam commonly sees itself as just an extension of the U.S., so the debates in the U.S. over gun rights, Trump, climate change, etc, might naturally extend to Guam. They have Democrats and Republicans and so do we right?
This isn't always the case. These debates sometimes become contorted as they cross the Pacific. Sometimes they will move and align differently, forming new coalitions of identity, where what is liberal there is now conservative here. The prism of political discourse will form in a different way.
The anti-abortion law and the issue of abortion itself can be one of those things. I am someone who aligns easily with the pro-choice-abortion-rights-feminist side. However, this historical moment pulls me in different directions.
I disagreed with the cultural arguments made by anti-choice advocates such as then-Archbishop Anthony Apuron and then-Sen. Elizabeth Arriola saying that abortion was against CHamoru culture.
For me, I don't see Catholicism as the alpha and the omega of CHamoru culture. It has been a very important part for centuries, but I do not think that it should dictate what is CHamoru or not. For instance, I do not feel that the Catholic idea of the church (or a government) being able to dictate what is right or not right for women's bodies is in line with CHamoru matrilineal notions of female empowerment.
But the debate doesn't end there.
The arguments that Apuron and Arriola also made about American colonialism through abortion rights laws were not without merit. Even if I agree with a particular edict from Washington D.C., I do not necessarily agree that our relationship to the U.S., where Supreme Court decisions, acts of Congress or executive orders apply to Guam despite our being a colony.
This is the nexus of that conflict when debates move into the territories. Is it really a victory for Guam when colonial authority is enhanced?
It is when you assume that whatever is good for the U.S. must be good for Guam. But what happens when the U.S. moves in a direction that you don't agree with or don't want, but your voice never even counted in the decision?
Michael Lujan Bevacqua is an author, artist, activist and assistant professor of CHamoru studies at the University of Guam.

Commodities markets on edge Ripple effect from deadly coronavirus also disrupting supply chains

Texto completo: In Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine before being able to reload.
BHP, which has headquarters in London and Melbourne and is one of the world's largest copper mining companies, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.
And from Qatar to Indonesia, exporters of liquefied natural gas face the prospect of disrupted shipments after a crucial importer in China is reportedly turning back deliveries after invoking clauses in long-term contracts that blame a "greater force."
The coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking global commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.
"We're seeing a rippling out," said Ed Morse, the global leader of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. "And we don't see it stopping."
Prices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquefied natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged. Currencies of countries that export these goods at high rates, including Brazil, South Africa and Australia, are near their lowest levels in recent memory. And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.
The woes of the commodities markets - arguably the worst-performing asset in financial markets this year - reflect the basic reality that China's industry-heavy economy is the most important consumer of raw materials on Earth.
And drastic efforts to quell the outbreak, including a lockdown of the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and severe curtailment of transportation nationwide, have slowed the Chinese economy sharply.
JPMorgan economists now think China's economy will grow at a pace of just 1% in the first quarter, well down from an initial forecast that anticipated a 6.3% rate.
The slowdown will be most pronounced in the industrial sector. Most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Monday in an effort to contain the virus. Some have reopened, but it could be weeks or months before production can fully ramp up.
That is a challenge for the supply chains that have developed in recent decades to deliver a constant supply of the materials that make Chinese factories hum.
Commodities markets have tumbled as those factories idled. Iron ore is down more than 10% this year. Copper is down about 8%, as is nickel, a key ingredient for stainless steel. Zinc and aluminum are both down more than 5% in 2020.
Whether the downturn is a blip or a serious shock is as much a question of epidemiology as economics.
If the spread of the virus starts to slow, as many expect it will, commodities will most likely rebound as production returns to normal and inventories that have been built up over the past few weeks gradually shrink.
Others are not so sure.
Citigroup's Morse said several key markets - like crude oil - had already been showing softness, suggesting that the global economy was weak even before the virus hit. That could complicate any quick rebound for commodities prices.
"The market has been thinking that there's going to be a V-shaped recovery at some point," he said. "And we don't think that's in the cards."
Caption: China's economy will grow 1% in the first quarter, down from an initial forecast of 6.3%, economists say amid the virus outbreak.

Texto completo: With the two early states down, many Democrats, anti-Trump independents and a few rogue Republicans are depressed — panicked that none of the candidates can beat Trump, convinced that the Democratic Party isn’t up to the challenge.
Hopefully, they aren’t so paralyzed that they’ll miss a newfound bonanza.
Since Michael Bloomberg has promised to foot a Gotham-sized chunk of the bill for the Democratic general election campaign, no matter who the eventual nominee is, it would be wise for the Democrats to adjust their planning immediately. If they delay or stay the course, they may miss a golden — actually, platinum — opportunity at a moment of political crisis.
Bloomberg’s bankroll should liberate vast resources usually spent on the political-marketing-industrial-complex hired by candidates, party organizations and giant Super PACs, an entrenched repertoire that consists mostly of polling, advertising of all sorts and marshalling paid or out-of-town “grassroots” field workers.
Bloomberg has basically said he’ll bankroll all that.
Swing states, local organizations and Senate races are the keys
So, what should Democrats and anti-Trumpers do?
Three criteria should guide.
First, of course, the ultimate goal of all new activism should be defeating Trump in 2020. That means if you live in an ironclad red or blue state, this year you must find ways to help out in swing states even if you can’t be there.
Second, resources should be directed to truly local organizations that will endure for elections past 2020. If Trump does win, then at least there will be a better Democratic (and democratic) infrastructure to fight the coming, bloody battles.

Third, Bloomberg’s bounty means Democrats can enlarge the map and throw more support to Senate races and presidential states that currently look like a stretch for Democrats.
According to a story in The New York Times, Bloomberg recently told his boosters that he didn’t want their money and they should give it to the D. N. C. and grassroots groups like Swing Left and GALvanize.
The D. N. C. can be dumped from the list; it will have plenty money and it has proven quite capable of squandering it.
But Bloomberg is spot on about the grassroots groups. Supporting them is perhaps the best way Democrats and anti-Trumpers of all stripes can contribute right now.
In the current environment of hardened polarization, there isn’t a huge, silent cadre of wavering voters. Minds are mind up for Trump or against. Motivation and mobilization are more important than persuasion this year. Human contact does that better than TV ads and spam.
How to win 2020 election
Two recent books by academics, "Politics is for Power" by Eitan Hersh and "American Resistance" by Dana Fisher, along with several articles by University of Pittsburgh historian Lara Putnam argue that the Democrats have consistently underinvested in local party and community organizations at a great cost. They also argue that a garden of activist groups that sprang up or ripened after Trump’s 2016 election was instrumental in feeding the movement that gave the Democrats control of the House in 2018. They need a massive infusion of fertilizer as soon as possible for maximum impact in November.
One of the most well-known and active groups is Indivisible which started as a Google Doc how-to manual for resisters soon after the 2016 elections. Other groups include Sister District, Flippable, Women’s March and Swing Left. The Movement Voter Project lists and supports scores of smaller “resistance” field groups in key 2020 states.
Post-Bloomberg bounty Democrats would also be smart to put time and money into key state parties rather than candidates. When candidates lose, their organizations evaporate; that happens with winners, too. State parties have the capacity to build enduring structures that help whole tickets top to bottom in the future, even if they haven’t done very well recently.
As for expanding both the Senate map — and simultaneously the presidential one in a few cases, groups, including Indivisible, are focusing on Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas.
For this approach to work, big donors will have to change their tunes and forego the kinds of contributions that buy access to candidates, politicians and fancy events. And they will have to support groups that are more progressive than they like.
People who are obsessed with politics but aren’t actually doing anything will have to wean themselves off the addictive “slacktivism” of Facebook, Twitter and online yodeling and figure out ways to help real activist groups near and far with volunteer time, expertise and/or well-targeted contributions.
Some grassroots groups might have to hold their noses and support nominees that are less progressive than they are.
And some pundits might have to switch from moral persuasion and brilliant analysis to supplying practical, how-to advice.
An easy target: Sanders has a bizarre radical past that Trump and Republicans would use to destroy him
Despite despondency in the ranks, many Democrats and anti-Trumpers are desperate to do something — anything — to help the cause and to do it right now. We’d better. It’s not looking good.

Texto completo: In Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine before being able to reload.
BHP, which has headquarters in London and Melbourne and is one of the world's largest copper mining companies, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.
And from Qatar to Indonesia, exporters of liquefied natural gas face the prospect of disrupted shipments after a crucial importer in China is reportedly turning back deliveries after invoking clauses in long-term contracts that blame a "greater force."
The coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking global commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.
"We're seeing a rippling out," said Ed Morse, the global leader of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. "And we don't see it stopping."
Prices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquefied natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged. Currencies of countries that export these goods at high rates, including Brazil, South Africa and Australia, are near their lowest levels in recent memory. And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.
The woes of the commodities markets -- arguably the worst-performing asset in financial markets this year -- reflect the basic reality that China's industry-heavy economy is the most important consumer of raw materials on Earth.
And drastic efforts to quell the outbreak, including a lockdown of the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and severe curtailment of transportation nationwide, have slowed the Chinese economy sharply.
JPMorgan economists now think China's economy will grow at a pace of just 1% in the first quarter, well down from an initial forecast that anticipated a 6.3% rate.
The slowdown will be most pronounced in the industrial sector. Most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Monday in an effort to contain the virus. Some have reopened, but it could be weeks or months before production can fully ramp up.
That is a challenge for the supply chains that have developed in recent decades to deliver a constant supply of the materials that make Chinese factories hum.
Commodities markets have tumbled as those factories idled. Iron ore is down more than 10% this year. Copper is down about 8%, as is nickel, a key ingredient for stainless steel. Zinc and aluminum are both down more than 5% in 2020.
Whether the downturn is a blip or a serious shock is as much a question of epidemiology as economics.
If the spread of the virus starts to slow, as many expect it will, commodities will most likely rebound as production returns to normal and inventories that have been built up over the past few weeks gradually shrink.
Others are not so sure.
Citigroup's Morse said several key markets -- like crude oil -- had already been showing softness, suggesting that the global economy was weak even before the virus hit. That could complicate any quick rebound for commodities prices.
"The market has been thinking that there's going to be a V-shaped recovery at some point," he said. "And we don't think that's in the cards."

Texto completo: Joseph Shabalala, the gentle-voiced South African songwriter whose choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, brought Zulu music to listeners worldwide, died Tuesday in a hospital in Pretoria. He was 78.
The cause was not immediately known, but his health had deteriorated after he had back surgery in 2013, said the group's manager, Xolani Majozi, who announced the death.
Shabalala began leading choral groups at the end of the 1950s. By the early 1970s his Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- in Zulu, "the black ax of Ladysmith," a town in KwaZulu-Natal province -- had become one of South Africa's most popular groups, singing about love, Zulu folklore, rural childhood memories, moral admonitions and Christian faith.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo's collaborations with Paul Simon on the 1986 album "Graceland," on the tracks "Homeless" and "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes," introduced South African choral music to an international pop audience.
In 1987 Simon produced Ladysmith Black Mambazo's first major-label album, "Shaka Zulu," which won a Grammy Award. The group went on to enjoy global recognition, including four more Grammys, decades of extensive touring, and guest appearances with Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton, Josh Groban, George Clinton and many others.
Nelson Mandela called Ladysmith Black Mambazo "South Africa's cultural ambassadors to the world."
Joseph Shabalala -- his full name was Bhekizizwe Joseph Siphatimandla Mxoveni Mshengu Bigboy Shabalala-- was born Aug. 28, 1941, near the town of Ladysmith, where his parents, Jonathan Mluwane Shabalala and Nomandla Elina Shabalala, worked on a white-owned farm.
In 1958 he left to find factory work in the port city of Durban, about 200 miles away. There he sang with the group Highlanders before returning to Ladysmith and starting a group, the Black Ones, with some of his brothers and cousins in 1960.
Shabalala often said that a series of dreams he had in 1964 led him to reshape the music of the group, which became Ladysmith Black Mambazo. He refined an a cappella Zulu choir style called isicathamiya -- "stalking style" -- that had grown out of song-and-dance competitions in hostels for migrant mineworkers, an urban adaptation of rural traditions.
Shabalala's version of isicathamiya was built on plush bass-heavy harmonies, call-and-response drive and dramatic contrasts of soft and loud passages, along with choreography that included tiptoeing moves and head-high kicks.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo triumphed at local competitions in the 1960s. In 1970, it performed for a live radio broadcast from Johannesburg. That performance soon led to a recording contract, and the group released dozens of albums on South African labels, adapting Zulu traditional songs.
The group was invited to perform at festivals in Germany beginning in 1980, and it appeared in "Rhythm of Resistance," a documentary about South African music by Jeremy Marre, which is where Simon first heard them. When he met Shabalala in Johannesburg, Simon invited him to collaborate.
"He came to me like a child asking his father, 'Can you teach me something?,' " Shabalala recalled in the liner notes to the expanded 2016 reissue of "Graceland." "He was so polite. That was my first time to hug a white man."
The group recorded "Homeless," merging Simon's material with a Zulu wedding song, in 1985 at Abbey Road Studios in London.
In May 1986, Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed "Homeless," which had not yet been released, with Simon on "Saturday Night Live."
While in New York, the group recorded another song with Simon, "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes." Ladysmith Black Mambazo joined Simon's international "Graceland" tour in 1986 and 1987.
The group resumed its own recording and touring career with vastly expanded opportunities. Through the next decades, Ladysmith Black Mambazo appeared on "Sesame Street" and "The Tonight Show." It performed when Nelson Mandela received his Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and a year later at Mandela's inauguration as president of South Africa.
The group appeared on Broadway, providing music for a 1993 play about apartheid, "The Song of Jacob Zulu," and Shabalala collaborated with the Steppenwolf Theater Company and the playwright Ntozake Shange on a musical based on one of his songs, "Nomathemba."
Ladysmith Black Mambazo also recorded steadily, collaborating with pop and rock musicians on the 2006 album "Long Walk to Freedom" and reaching back to Shabalala's childhood with "Songs From a Zulu Farm" in 2011.
In 2014, Shabalala announced his retirement from Ladysmith Black Mambazo; three of his sons -- Sibongseni, Thamsanqa and Thulani--are in the current lineup of the group, which canceled its current tour on hearing of his death.
Shabalala's wife of three decades, Nellie, was murdered in 2002. His survivors include his wife, Thokozile Shabalala; two daughters; four more sons; and 36 grandchildren.

Xi ousts pair of officials amid outrage over virus response

Texto completo: President Xi Jinping summarily ousted two top Communist Party officials from the province at the center of the coronavirus epidemic Thursday, exacting political punishment for the regional government's handling of a crisis that seemed far from under control.
The reshuffling of the party leadership in the province, Hubei, and its capital, Wuhan, reflected an effort by Xi to contain not only the political and economic damage of the epidemic but also any simmering public anger among millions of people locked down now for more than three weeks.
The Communist Party replaced both officials with proteges of Xi who have extensive backgrounds in public security.
The moves, announced in terse statements in state news media, came as the number of deaths and infections skyrocketed by the highest amounts in any day. The rise, in part, reflected changes in the way infections in Hubei are counted, but the latest figures confirmed warnings that the true scale of the epidemic remains muddled.
The death toll from the virus, known officially as COVID-19, reached 1,367 Thursday, up 254 from a day earlier, and the number of confirmed cases jumped to 59,804, up 15,152.
"The personnel changes can be spun as Beijing finally taking decisive action and beginning the process of sheeting home responsibility for the crisis," said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, using a nautical idiom meaning to fix blame, "but they also reek a little of panic."
Only the day before, Xi presided over a third emergency session of the country's top political body, the Politburo Standing Committee, and declared that the government's efforts were beginning to have "positive effects."
"All regions and departments performed their duties actively and conscientiously," Xi said, once again referring to the fight against the epidemic as a "people's war."
Xi's reassuring remarks made the dismissals, like the rise in new cases and deaths, even more of a surprise.
In a separate move that underscored similar concerns, the government's highest body, the State Council, announced that it had appointed another Xi protege to take over the national office overseeing Hong Kong, which has been roiled by protests since last summer and by the coronavirus now.
At Wednesday's meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, Xi urged officials to do everything possible to improve the care of those sickened in Hubei. At the same time, he urged them to make sure that business returned to normal and that the government met its economic development goals for the year, according to an official summary of the meeting by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.
Meanwhile, U.S. officials Thursday announced the country's 15th confirmed case of the new coronavirus -- an evacuee from China who had been under quarantine in Texas.
The patient, who had been flown to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio last week, was reported in stable condition. The infection was confirmed Wednesday night, making the person the first coronavirus patient in Texas.

Prosecutor probes resistance to sharing Russia intelligence

Texto completo: Trump administration officials investigating the government's response to Russia's election interference in 2016 appear to be hunting for a basis to accuse Obama-era intelligence officials of hiding evidence or manipulating analysis about Moscow's covert operation, according to people familiar with aspects of the inquiry.
Since his election, President Donald Trump has attacked the intelligence agencies that concluded that Russia secretly tried to help him win, fostering a narrative that they sought to delegitimize his victory. He has long promoted the investigation by John Durham, the prosecutor examining their actions, as a potential pathway to proving that a deep-state cabal conspired against him.
Questions asked by Durham, who was assigned by Attorney General William Barr to scrutinize the early actions of law enforcement and intelligence officials struggling to understand the scope of Russia's scheme, suggest that Durham may have come to view with suspicion several clashes between analysts at different intelligence agencies over who could see each other's highly sensitive secrets, the people said.
Durham appears to be pursuing a theory that the CIA, under its former director John Brennan, had a preconceived notion about Russia or was trying to get to a particular result -- and was nefariously trying to keep other agencies from seeing the full picture, lest they interfere with that goal, the people said.
But officials from the FBI and the National Security Agency have told Durham and his investigators that such an interpretation is wrong and based on a misunderstanding of how the intelligence community functions, the people said. National security officials are typically cautious about sharing their most delicate information, like source identities, even with other agencies inside the executive branch.
Durham's questioning is certain to add to accusations that Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies, like Brennan, who has been an outspoken critic of the president. Barr, who is overseeing the investigation, has come under attack in recent days over senior Justice Department officials' intervention to lighten a prison sentencing recommendation by lower-level prosecutors for Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone.
A spokesman for Durham did not respond to phone and email inquiries. The CIA and the NSA declined to comment. The people familiar with aspects of Durham's investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.
The Justice Department inspector general, who released the results late last year of an inquiry into aspects of the FBI's Russia investigation, found no documentary or testimonial evidence senior law enforcement and intelligence officials had engaged in a high-level conspiracy to sabotage Trump, the narrative the president and his supporters continue to embrace.
Durham's questions shed additional light on where he may be going.
In recent months, Durham and his team have examined emails among a small group of intelligence analysts from multiple agencies, including the CIA, FBI and NSA, who worked together to assess the Russian operation. Investigators have interviewed those analysts and their supervisors about the motivations behind several episodes in which some sought access to delicate information from the other agencies and were told -- initially, at least -- that they could not see it.
One fight, they said, concerned the identity and placement of a CIA source inside the Kremlin. Analysts at the NSA wanted to know more about him to weigh the credibility of his information. The CIA was initially reluctant to share details about the Russian's identity but eventually relented.

Texto completo: Under the shade of a banyan tree, a group of worshippers recite Sanskrit mantras. A couple of men step forward and light a fire. Then they start walking, hands folded, as if in a trance, toward a statue.
Some drape flowers over it. Others sing songs of valor to the statue. It is of Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the revered father of Indian independence and a symbol of nonviolent resistance the world over.
Indians consider Gandhi one of the fathers of their nation. But the rise of a Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has uncorked many extremist beliefs, and admiration for Gandhi's killer, among some, has become more open. It is a sign of how much India has changed in the 5 1/2 years since Modi took power.
"Gandhi was a traitor," said Pooja Shakun Pandey, who blames Gandhi for partition and who participated in a recent ceremony worshipping Godse on the anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. "He deserved to be shot in the head."
Prominent Hindu nationalists still invoke Gandhi, but in many cases they are trying to co-opt his legacy -- presenting their policies, however divisive, as congruent with his beliefs. One example: a recent citizenship law pushed by Modi's government that, critics say, discriminates against Muslims and threatens the secular state that Gandhi had envisioned.
Other Hindu nationalists, though, continue to vilify the man admired worldwide as an apostle of peace.
The ceremony at the statue venerating his killer, in Meerut, in the north of the country, is not the only sign of respect for Godse in India these days.
Across the country, more than a dozen statues of Gandhi's killer have been erected. Several Hindu temples are being converted into Godse temples.
Last year the government of Uttar Pradesh state, which is led by a firebrand Hindu monk, Yogi Adityanath, proposed changing the name of Meerut to Godse City. One of the first Godse statues was unveiled there about three years ago. Officials now say they have been overwhelmed by demands for more Godse memorials.
Ramachandra Guha, a preeminent biographer of Gandhi, said that fans of Gandhi's killer were no longer a fringe group. Instead, he said, Godse admiration has found a place among what he considers a worryingly large segment of the population.
"It is foul, despicable, but it is real and widespread," Guha said.
In recent months, vandals with links to right-wing groups have defaced pictures of Gandhi, attacked his memorials and scrawled the word traitor on his picture. In June last year, a statue of Gandhi was decapitated in eastern India.
The growing cult around Godse seems rooted in the same militant brand of Hindu nationalism that inspired Gandhi's killer to shoot him one January evening in 1948.
That day, Gandhi walked slowly across a stately lawn in New Delhi, India's capital, leaning on the shoulders of two young women. Godse stepped out from a crowd, greeted him and touched his feet. He then pulled out a Beretta and shot the frail 78-year-old three times in the upper body.
Godse was born in a small village in central India to an upper-caste family. Three of their older sons died from an unknown illness. Thinking it would protect their new child to treat him as a girl, they pierced the young Godse's nose and made him wear a nose ring until they had another son.
For wearing the nose ring, Godse was called Nathuram, meaning a man with pierced nose.
When he was a young man, Godse joined the RSS, a Hindu nationalist group that many members of India's governing party, including Modi, have been part of.
Godse believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims and by allowing Pakistan to break off during the partition of India in 1947. That line is still echoed by many Hindu nationalists who see Godse as a national hero and Gandhi as a traitor.
Technology has helped spread the revisionist attitude toward Godse.
The availability of cheap data in much of the countryside has helped create an ecosystem of disinformation in which it is difficult to sift fact from fiction. WhatsApp messages shared widely in rural areas say that if Godse had not killed Gandhi, India would have fallen apart as the Soviet Union did. Other messages call Gandhi a womanizer.
Public meetings eulogizing Gandhi's killer are also used to spread lies and justify the murder.
Amit Jaiswal Jain, an advertising professional in the town of Agra, believes Godse is a hero because he tried to stop Gandhi's push for India to help the newly formed Pakistan.
"Gandhi should be respected," Jain, 38, said. "But the new India should not tolerate the castigation of Godse."
Jain, along with some of his Hindu nationalist friends, are urging the Uttar Pradesh government to insert a special chapter in school textbooks on Godse. The idea is to present Godse as a visionary for Hindu nationalism and one of the drivers behind the creation of a Hindu nation.
Hindu nationalism -- an ideology that animates Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party -- is premised on the idea that India is a Hindu nation and that minorities, especially Muslims, must subscribe to Hindu primacy.
Pandey, who was visiting Godse's statue in Meerut recently, is one of the most educated people in her village in northwestern India, earning a doctorate in mathematics and teaching at a local university. She is also a leader of Hindu Mahasabha, a group formed more than 100 years ago that espouses militant Hindu nationalism.
Last year, she was arrested at the scene of Gandhi's killing. In a video that brought her national fame, she is seen shooting Gandhi's effigy.
Pandey runs the Meerut chapter of Hindu Mahasabha with Ashok Sharma. They hold prayer meetings in temples across Uttar Pradesh and exhort people on why this is the time, under Modi, to turn India into a Hindu nation.
On a recent morning in Meerut, Sharma sat for a ritual petitioning Lord Hanuman, the monkey God of Hindu mythology, to ward off Gandhi's spirit.
"Hey, son of the wind," Sharma prayed toward the fire, referring to Lord Hanuman, "remove Gandhi's filthy soul from this pure land."
Pandey said that if Godse were alive she would drink the water used to wash his feet.
"Our hero stopped Gandhi's poison from spreading in this pure land," she said. "If I was born before Godse, I would have shot Gandhi myself."

Egypt's population hits milestone

Texto completo: Somewhere in Egypt, around lunchtime Tuesday, the country reached a major milestone: Its 100 millionth citizen was born.
The birth of that citizen -- whom officials identified as a girl named Yasmine Rabie, in a village in Minya governorate -- was noted in Cairo by a giant counter outside the country's national statistics agency that has been ticking upward for years.
Hitting 100,000,000 marked human plenty, certainly, but also an uneasy moment in a country gripped by worries that its exploding population will exacerbate poverty and unemployment, and contribute to the scarcity of basic resources like land and water.
Egypt's Cabinet said last week that it was on "high alert" to fight population growth, which President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has described as a threat to national security on par with terrorism. If unchecked, the population could reach 128 million by 2030, officials say.
El-Sissi tried to push back the tide with a public health campaign called "Two Is Enough" to persuade parents to have fewer children. Like many such efforts, it failed.
Fertility rates have risen since 2008, to 3.5 children per woman, according to the United Nations, and the population is growing 1.8% annually -- a rate that, in Egypt's crowded cities and towns, adds 1 million citizens every six months.
"The kids are coming thick and fast," said David Sims, a lecturer at the American University in Cairo and author of "Understanding Cairo: The Logic of a City Out of Control." "What the hell are they going to do?"
Egypt's population crisis is amplified by its unforgiving geography: 95% of the population lives on about 4% of the land, a green belt roughly half the size of Ireland that follows the Nile as it snakes through the desert then fans out into the lush Nile Delta.
The construction of a huge new dam on the Nile in Ethiopia, due to start filling this summer, has focused the public's fears about the existing strains on the river, largely from population growth.
Fertility rates are highest in rural areas, where a large family is considered a blessing. But their effect is felt most keenly in greater Cairo, where a sprawling megalopolis of about 20 million inhabitants is spilling into the surrounding desert and farmland.
Seen from roof height, the city looms as a vista of flat concrete roofs dotted with millions of satellite dishes. Even at the pyramids of Giza, houses, hotels and golf courses push in from three sides, leaving tourists with just one direction for photographs with a sand-filled backdrop.
On a recent night, Ahmed Abdel-Hadi, a taxi driver for the past 22 years, threaded his battered sedan through a river of traffic in Nasr City, a middle-class neighborhood. A cacophony of blaring horns filled the air. An ambulance inched past, its lights flashing.
Fistfights between irate drivers have been growing more frequent as traffic has worsened, Abdel-Hadi noted -- a problem that peaks during the holy season of Ramadan, when Egyptians rush to break their fast at sunset.
But Abdel-Hadi is also part of the problem. A father of four children, ages 10 to 19, he scoffed at the mention of government campaigns urging him to restrict his family.
"Human capital is valuable," he declared. "A man's family is a reflection of his income, and that's what should determine how many children I have, not someone trying to dictate to me."
Suzanne Mubarak, wife of former President Hosni Mubarak, spearheaded a push during her husband's rule to reduce fertility rates. It was partly successful: During the 1990s and 2000s, rates fell to 3.0 from 5.2, according to government figures.
But the rate rose again around the time of the Arab Spring in 2011, for reasons that are not entirely clear, but probably stem from economic disruption, government turmoil and a drop in birth control funding from Western governments.
Under el-Sissi, the government has dispatched thousands of family planning advocates into rural areas and offered cheap contraceptives -- as little as 6 cents for a packet of three condoms in a government store and 12 cents for an intrauterine device.
The country's leading Islamic authority, Al Azhar, has endorsed the government plans and stressed that family planning is not forbidden by God.
But critics say the government mostly talks a good game on population control and that its actions have not matched its slogans. El-Sissi's wife has not been a visible force on family planning, while his officials have tried to dent the problem with public health programs.
"Overpopulation is eating everything," said Dr. Amr A. Nadim, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Ain Ain Shams University. "But I don't feel the government is working all that hard on it."
He listed the issues: an erratic supply of contraceptives of variable quality; poor medical training; U.S. government funding that dried up; and no longer obliging new doctors to take family planning courses.
The population crush also affects him personally. "Sometimes I'm called to a pregnant woman in an emergency, but I can't reach her because of the traffic," he said.
"The problem," he added, "is that we don't have a real strategy to combat it."
Other large developing countries with soaring populations have managed to get the problem under control. Vietnam, where the population grew to 97 million in 2018 from 60 million in 1986, has reduced the rate of increase to 1%. Bangladesh, which has a population of more than 160 million, has done the same.
In Egypt, though, the rate of growth is nearly twice as high, at 1.79% in 2018-19. More than 700,000 young Egyptians enter the job market every year, said Aleksandar Bodiroza, representative of the United Nations Population Fund in Egypt. "That's a daunting task for any government," he said.
The population milestone passed Tuesday was met with a shrug by many Egyptians, for whom the difficulties of life in a congested city that is bursting at the seams are nothing new.
Ahmed Alaa, 24, a marketing agent, said his desire to avoid congestion often shaped his days, and often that means simply staying home "It's become so normalized, this congestion," he said. "You can't set an appointment to do anything. The traffic is just so crazy."

Texto completo: In Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine before being able to reload.
BHP, which has headquarters in London and Melbourne and is one of the world's largest copper mining companies, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.
And from Qatar to Indonesia, exporters of liquefied natural gas face the prospect of disrupted shipments after a crucial importer in China is reportedly turning back deliveries after invoking clauses in long-term contracts that blame a "greater force."
The coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking global commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.
"We're seeing a rippling out," said Ed Morse, the global leader of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. "And we don't see it stopping."
Prices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquefied natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged. Currencies of countries that export these goods at high rates, including Brazil, South Africa and Australia, are near their lowest levels in recent memory. And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.
The woes of the commodities markets - arguably the worst-performing asset in financial markets this year - reflect the basic reality that China's industry-heavy economy is the most important consumer of raw materials on Earth.
And drastic efforts to quell the outbreak, including a lockdown of the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and severe curtailment of transportation nationwide, have slowed the Chinese economy sharply.
JPMorgan economists now think China's economy will grow at a pace of just 1% in the first quarter, well down from an initial forecast that anticipated a 6.3% rate.
The slowdown will be most pronounced in the industrial sector. Most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Monday in an effort to contain the virus. Some have reopened, but it could be weeks or months before production can fully ramp up.
That is a challenge for the supply chains that have developed in recent decades to deliver a constant supply of the materials that make Chinese factories hum.
Commodities markets have tumbled as those factories idled. Iron ore is down more than 10% this year. Copper is down about 8%, as is nickel, a key ingredient for stainless steel. Zinc and aluminum are both down more than 5% in 2020.
Whether the downturn is a blip or a serious shock is as much a question of epidemiology as economics.
If the spread of the virus starts to slow, as many expect it will, commodities will most likely rebound as production returns to normal and inventories that have been built up over the past few weeks gradually shrink.
Others are not so sure.
Citigroup's Morse said several key markets - like crude oil - had already been showing softness, suggesting that the global economy was weak even before the virus hit. That could complicate any quick rebound for commodities prices.
"The market has been thinking that there's going to be a V-shaped recovery at some point," he said. "And we don't think that's in the cards."

Texto completo: In Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine before being able to reload.
BHP, which has headquarters in London and Melbourne and is one of the world's largest copper mining companies, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.
And from Qatar to Indonesia, exporters of liquefied natural gas face the prospect of disrupted shipments after a crucial importer in China is reportedly turning back deliveries after invoking clauses in long-term contracts that blame a "greater force."
The coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking global commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.
"We're seeing a rippling out," said Ed Morse, the global leader of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. "And we don't see it stopping."
Prices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquefied natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged. Currencies of countries that export these goods at high rates, including Brazil, South Africa and Australia, are near their lowest levels in recent memory. And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.
The woes of the commodities markets - arguably the worst-performing asset in financial markets this year - reflect the basic reality that China's industry-heavy economy is the most important consumer of raw materials on Earth.
And drastic efforts to quell the outbreak, including a lockdown of the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and severe curtailment of transportation nationwide, have slowed the Chinese economy sharply.
JPMorgan economists now think China's economy will grow at a pace of just 1% in the first quarter, well down from an initial forecast that anticipated a 6.3% rate.
The slowdown will be most pronounced in the industrial sector. Most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Monday in an effort to contain the virus. Some have reopened, but it could be weeks or months before production can fully ramp up.
That is a challenge for the supply chains that have developed in recent decades to deliver a constant supply of the materials that make Chinese factories hum.
Commodities markets have tumbled as those factories idled. Iron ore is down more than 10% this year. Copper is down about 8%, as is nickel, a key ingredient for stainless steel. Zinc and aluminum are both down more than 5% in 2020.
Whether the downturn is a blip or a serious shock is as much a question of epidemiology as economics.
If the spread of the virus starts to slow, as many expect it will, commodities will most likely rebound as production returns to normal and inventories that have been built up over the past few weeks gradually shrink.
Others are not so sure.
Citigroup's Morse said several key markets - like crude oil - had already been showing softness, suggesting that the global economy was weak even before the virus hit. That could complicate any quick rebound for commodities prices.
"The market has been thinking that there's going to be a V-shaped recovery at some point," he said. "And we don't think that's in the cards."

Texto completo: The son of Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki is leading a group of social media influencers paid to post content promoting Mike Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Mick Purzycki, the 32-year-old son of Mayor Mike Purzycki, is the lead strategist of a new project called Meme 2020, which brings together close to 20 social media accounts with a collective audience of more than 60 million followers.
Purzycki's profile rose last year due to his involvement in the failed Fyre Festival and subsequent Netflix documentary. He is the chief executive of Jerry Media, a media and marketing company with a foothold in the online influencer economy.
The company also has its own meme-making Instagram, @F—Jerry, with close to 15 million followers.
In a statement, the Bloomberg campaign said Meme 2020 is an attempt to "reach people where they are" while competing with President Donald Trump's "powerful digital operation."
Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on his bid for the Democratic nomination. It's unclear how much the campaign is paying for each post. Social media influencers are typically compensated based on their follower count.
According to the Times' article, Purzycki started forming Meme 2020 in January by tapping influencers whom he had formed relationships with through Jerry Media.
The sponsored posts started being shared this week and appear as fake direct messages from Bloomberg. Together they work to build Bloomberg into a "self-aware ironic character."
The posts' captions disclose that they are paid for by Bloomberg.
Jerry Media, led by Purzycki, was one of several marketing agencies promoting the 2017 Fyre Festival in the Bahamas — a disastrous "luxury" music festival that left attendees stranded and the festival organizer in prison.
As its primary marketing tactic, the festival enlisted dozens of influencers including Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner to post about the event.
The company turned its footage leading up to the event into a popular Netflix documentary co-produced by Purzycki. He also appeared in the film.
In the wake of the film's release, the company came under fire for not properly crediting content posted to its Instagram account. Many also criticized Jerry Media's heavy involvement in the documentary.
Purzycki, who was born Michael Purzycki Jr., was raised in Wilmington while his father headed the Riverfront Development Corp. He is a graduate of Tatnall School and the University of Delaware, where he studied Chinese and finance. He previously worked for the e-commerce marketplace Groupon.

@grapefruitboys shared this fake message with Bloomberg Wednesday night. The account has 2.7 million followers.

Communism is the incubator for virus

Texto completo: The coronavirus outbreak sweeping across China, and now threatening dozens of other countries, including the United States, is not just a natural disaster. It is the deadly consequence of the Chinese Communist Party's malfeasance and misrule. And, as has been the case for so much of the CCP's seven-decade hegemony, the cruel irony is that the people of China are its main victims.
More than 42,000 Chinese people have been diagnosed with coronavirus since the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan in December — many times the number who contracted SARS in 2002-03 worldwide.
More than 1,000 people have died, and nearly 60 million people are in lockdown. In Wuhan and surrounding areas, undersupplied doctors are wearing rain jackets for want of biohazard gear, citizens fear imminent food shortages and local crematoria are working around the clock to dispose of bodies.
It did not have to be this way. As The New York Times reported, the first case of coronavirus appeared in early December. But Chinese officials did not act for more than a month. When a Wuhan doctor, Li Wenliang, tried to warn his medical school classmates that an unfamiliar illness was ravaging Wuhan Central Hospital, he and his classmates were silenced by local authorities, who threatened to punish anyone "spreading rumors" and "disrupting social order."
By the time authorities finally acknowledged what was happening, a full blown epidemic was underway. "At critical turning points," wrote The Times, "Chinese authorities put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis."
In an additional tragic turn: Dr. Li contracted coronavirus while treating patients. The ophthalmologist died last Friday at the age of 34.
Dr. Li's courage and commitment to human life made him a hero to the Chinese people and an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party.
'Clean,' 'adaptive,' and 'responsive' are only CCP's lies Secrecy, denial, and coercion are not bugs in Xi Jinping's regime. They are core features. The CCP, concerned first and foremost in its own survival, has had to renegotiate a fragile social contract in recent years, staking its continued right to rule on ensuring that the lives of Chinese citizens are safe, healthy and prosperous.
Xi, the party overlords in Beijing and their apparatchiks in China's provincial and municipal governments have promised that the Chinese government can be "clean," or free of corruption. They promised to be "adaptive" to crises and changing societywide conditions. They promised to be "responsive" to the demands of the citizenry, especially China's rapidly expanding professional class — its millions of attorneys, journalists, scientists, doctors and more, who are increasingly part of a global exchange, and whose demands for efficient social services (good schools, reliable clinics, etc.) resemble the demands of the Western upper-middle class.
What has happened instead? Literal plagues have laid waste to the population. Toxic environmental conditions prevail across the country, especially in China's major cities, where air pollution is so bad that it obscures sunlight.
The government's efforts to silence increasingly vocal political dissidents and religious minorities have exposed a cross-country network of internment camps, a government-sponsored slave labor industry and a horrifying black market in organ harvesting that serves wealthy party members and their family and friends.
And the government's attacks on Hong Kong's semiautonomous status have spurred prolonged, intense protests that have startled party leadership.
Chinese citizens deserve real transparency, accountability These episodes, and others that have flown under the radar of international news media, have brought sharply into question whether the Chinese system, as it is constituted, can really be "clean," "adaptive" and "responsive." And rightly so.
When "east, west, south, north and center, the party leads everything," as the CCP declared in 2017, it cannot simply slough off responsibility for fatal mistakes and grave mismanagement. But it also can't cop to its failures. If the tyrants in Beijing acknowledge their mistakes, they chip away at their own right to rule. Inevitably, their response is to sweep problems under the rug and demand even greater control over the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese citizens — evermore invasive surveillance, evermore complete submission to CCP ideological propaganda. This is a risky game.
There is a better way, of course. Real transparency and democratic accountability help to prevent these sorts of nightmares. Truly clean, adaptive and responsive government is most likely where information can flow freely, where governments are honest and where the people can hold their leaders responsible — and replace them with genuine alternatives. A system that prioritizes and protects the inviolable dignity of its citizens, rather than the perpetuation of its ruling cabal, is the only one where real civic health is possible.
Communism is the perfect incubator for the coronavirus. China's predatory system preys on its own people. Trials become tragedies, crises become catastrophes, and the bosses in Beijing exploit their own failures as cover for new and worse abuses.
America and her allies should be clear about what is happening. China's people are sick because the Chinese system is.

Lower Energy Prices
Help Curb Inflation
A sharp drop in energy prices slowed U.S. consumer inflation at the start of this year.
The consumer-price index -- which measures changes in how much Americans are paying for everyday items ranging from clothes to grocery items -- rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in January, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was a smaller increase than in December, when the index added 0.2%.
Energy prices fell 0.7% from the previous month, with gasoline down by 1.6% as global fuel demand ebbed amid China's coronavirus outbreak.
Thursday's report offered other signs of slightly firmer inflation last month.
Excluding the often volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices rose 0.2% from the previous month, up slightly from the 0.1% rise in December. Those prices were up 2.3% from a year earlier, the same annual increase as in the previous three months.

WHITE HOUSE
Hicks Will Return
In a New Capacity
President Trump's former communications director Hope Hicks is set to return to the White House where she will focus on shaping the Republican's political operation as he approaches re-election.
Ms. Hicks left the administration in February 2019 and took a role at Fox. In October, she became chief communications officer at Fox, a new company that includes 21st Century Fox Inc.'s entertainment and news assets that weren't sold to Walt Disney Co.
Fox Co-Chairman Rupert Murdoch is also executive chairman of Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.
Ms. Hicks is expected to return to the White House in the coming weeks as a counselor to the president, administration officials said. She will report to Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser who is overseeing the re-election bid. Her return was earlier reported by the New York Times.

Religious Group Sued
Over Alleged Abuse
A woman who said she was sexually abused and trafficked filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles against La Luz del Mundo, one of the largest religious organizations in Mexico, and its leader, Naason Joaquin Garcia.
Mr. Garcia was arrested in Los Angeles last year and charged with more than a dozen sex crimes, including rape, human trafficking and child pornography. He has pleaded not guilty.
Sochil Martin, the plaintiff in the case, is the first to sue Mr. Garcia or the church since his arrest, according to her lawyers.
The suit alleges an international conspiracy by leaders of La Luz del Mundo to take advantage of its members sexually and use them for free labor. The suit names a number of bishops and church leaders who Ms. Martin says abetted the abuse and human trafficking.
A lawyer for Mr. Garcia didn't respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit, nor did church officials.

CLIMATE
January Was Hottest
On Record for Month
Last month was the hottest January since scientists began keeping temperature records in 1880, U.S. government forecasters said Thursday.
The global average land and ocean surface temperature in January was 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit above the average January temperatures for the 20th century, because of the changing climate, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
In parts of Russia, Scandinavia and eastern Canada, temperatures exceeded the old averages by 9 degrees Fahrenheit.
Warmer temperatures mean melting snow and ice. The extent of Arctic sea ice was 5.3% below the average from 1981-2010, and Antarctic sea ice was 9.8% below the average.
The hottest January after the second-hottest year on record "is one of those indications that things are warming dramatically," said University of Illinois climate scientist Don Wuebbles.

Texto completo: Transgender ideology can take on a comical character, as in a recent American Civil Liberties Union commentary objecting to sales tax on tampons and similar products while pondering: "How can we recognize that barriers to menstrual access are a form of sex discrimination without erasing the lived experiences of trans men and non-binary people who menstruate, as well as women who don't?"
Yet it's one thing to claim that a man can "identify" as a woman or vice versa. Increasingly we see a dangerous and antiscientific trend toward the outright denial of biological sex.
"The idea of two sexes is simplistic," an article in the scientific journal Nature declared in 2015. "Biologists now think there is a wider spectrum than that." A 2018 Scientific American piece asserted that "biologists now think there is a larger spectrum than just binary female and male." And an October 2018 New York Times headline promised to explain "Why Sex Is Not Binary."
The argument is that because some people are intersex -- they have developmental conditions resulting in ambiguous sex characteristics -- the categories male and female exist on a "spectrum," and are therefore no more than "social constructs." If male and female are merely arbitrary groupings, it follows that everyone, regardless of genetics or anatomy should be free to choose to identify as male or female, or to reject sex entirely in favor of a new bespoke "gender identity."
To characterize this line of reasoning as having no basis in reality would be an egregious understatement. It is false at every conceivable scale of resolution.
In humans, as in most animals or plants, an organism's biological sex corresponds to one of two distinct types of reproductive anatomy that develop for the production of small or large sex cells -- sperm and eggs, respectively -- and associated biological functions in sexual reproduction. In humans, reproductive anatomy is unambiguously male or female at birth more than 99.98% of the time. The evolutionary function of these two anatomies is to aid in reproduction via the fusion of sperm and ova. No third type of sex cell exists in humans, and therefore there is no sex "spectrum" or additional sexes beyond male and female. Sex is binary.
There is a difference, however, between the statements that there are only two sexes (true) and that everyone can be neatly categorized as either male or female (false). The existence of only two sexes does not mean sex is never ambiguous. But intersex individuals are extremely rare, and they are neither a third sex nor proof that sex is a "spectrum" or a "social construct." Not everyone needs to be discretely assignable to one or the other sex in order for biological sex to be functionally binary. To assume otherwise -- to confuse secondary sexual traits with biological sex itself -- is a category error.
Denying the reality of biological sex and supplanting it with subjective "gender identity" is not merely an eccentric academic theory. It raises serious human-rights concerns for vulnerable groups including women, homosexuals and children.
Women have fought hard for sex-based legal protections. Female-only spaces are necessary due to the pervasive threat of male violence and sexual assault. Separate sporting categories are also necessary to ensure that women and girls don't have to face competitors who have acquired the irreversible performance-enhancing effects conferred by male puberty. The different reproductive roles of males and females require laws to safeguard women from discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. The falsehood that sex is rooted in subjective identity instead of objective biology renders all these sex-based rights impossible to enforce.
The denial of biological sex also erases homosexuality, as same-sex attraction is meaningless without the distinction between the sexes. Many activists now define homosexuality as attraction to the "same gender identity" rather than the same sex. This view is at odds with the scientific understanding of human sexuality. Lesbians have been denounced as "bigots" for expressing a reluctance to date men who identify as women. The successful normalization of homosexuality could be undermined by miring it in an untenable ideology.
Those most vulnerable to sex denialism are children. When they're taught that sex is grounded in identity instead of biology, sex categories can easily become conflated with regressive stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. Masculine girls and feminine boys may become confused about their own sex. The dramatic rise of "gender dysphoric" adolescents -- especially young girls -- in clinics likely reflects this new cultural confusion.
The large majority of gender-dysphoric youths eventually outgrow their feelings of dysphoria during puberty, and many end up identifying as homosexual adults. "Affirmation" therapies, which insist a child's cross-sex identity should never be questioned, and puberty-blocking drugs, advertised as a way for children to "buy time" to sort out their identities, may only solidify feelings of dysphoria, setting them on a pathway to more invasive medical interventions and permanent infertility. This pathologizing of sex-atypical behavior is extremely worrying and regressive. It is similar to gay "conversion" therapy, except that it's now bodies instead of minds that are being converted to bring children into "proper" alignment with themselves.
The time for politeness on this issue has passed. Biologists and medical professionals need to stand up for the empirical reality of biological sex. When authoritative scientific institutions ignore or deny empirical fact in the name of social accommodation, it is an egregious betrayal to the scientific community they represent. It undermines public trust in science, and it is dangerously harmful to those most vulnerable.

LEARNING FROM LOSS DEMOCRATS STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT WENT WRONG IN 2016

Texto completo: Things are not going swimmingly for the Democrats right now.
President Donald Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial, and he gave a State of the Union address that made Democrats feel like the hapless Japanese military as they watched Godzilla stroll through downtown Tokyo. His polling is up to historic highs (though in fairness, Mr. Trump's approval rating is historically low for a president's historic highs), and the economy is roaring.
Meanwhile, the only thing that could have made the Iowa caucuses more disastrous would have been an outbreak of the coronavirus. The Democratic candidate the White House fears the most - Joe Biden - appears to be tanking, and the candidate the White House most wants to run against - Bernie Sanders - appears to be pulling out in front.
What's going on?
I have a theory. Or rather, I'm persuaded by a theory I picked up from Denver University professor of political science Seth Masket, author of the forthcoming book "Learning From Loss: The Democrats 2016-2020." The Democrats can't figure out what to do next because they still haven't figured out what really went wrong the last time.
Every four years, one of the parties loses the presidential race. As the party pooh-bahs and political pundits play the blame game, a rough consensus quickly emerges about why the party nominee lost. Sometimes the most self-serving explanation wins out: It was all the candidate's fault. The election was winnable, and our ideas are great, but our nominee just couldn't make the sale.
But sometimes the postmortem is coldly empirical and data-driven. We failed to connect with suburban voters. We didn't turn out our base in Michigan or Ohio. We never came up with a good response to those attacks. And sometimes a consensus emerges that the party itself is ideologically out of touch with a majority of the electorate.
Bill Clinton beat the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, in 1992 for a number of reasons, but one of the main ones was that the party recognized that its previous two nominees - Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis - seemed too beholden to special interests and too committed to liberal orthodoxy. Mr. Clinton ran as a "different kind of Democrat" who went out of his way to shoot some liberal sacred cows.
Twenty-four years later, his wife was the nominee. Hillary Clinton lost the election but not the popular vote. Were it not for some 78,000 votes in five counties - four in Florida and one in Michigan - Ms. Clinton would have won the Electoral College tally as well. Such a close election made it harder to understand what went wrong.
Ms. Clinton did not take her defeat well and spent much of 2017 offering self-serving theories about who or what was to blame, from sexist men and self-hating women to voter suppression and fake news to, of course, the Russians. This made a sober accounting of the Democrats' loss even harder.
And then there's the Bernie factor. Mr. Sanders lost the primaries in 2016, but it's like he never got the memo. He and his supporters took their surprisingly strong showing to claim a mandate for changes to the party.
There's also the fact that Mr. Trump won despite most polls predicting a Clinton victory. This shock, Mr. Masket writes, "undermined many activists' longstanding beliefs about just what sorts of candidates are electable."
Add in the fact that the last winning Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, won not by running to the center the way Bill Clinton did but by turbocharging the turnout of the Democratic base, and you can see why many Democrats think that's a winning strategy this time around. That's certainly Mr. Sanders' bet. Indeed, for most of the last year, nearly all of the Democratic candidates were fighting in Mr. Sanders' lane and working under the same theory.
But Mr. Obama won in 2008 thanks in part to a severe economic crisis and an unpopular war. He was also a compelling candidate. None of that applies today. Actually, the situation is something closer to the reverse.
The Democrats desperately need a candidate who gives moderates and Trump-exhausted Republicans an excuse to oust an incumbent in a time of peace and prosperity. The Trump team understands this, which is why it's trying to bury Mr. Biden and boost Bernie. Unfortunately for the Democrats, they can't see it.

Texto completo: The number of homeless students enrolled in Massachusetts has increased, according to a new report by the National Center for Homeless Education.
The student homeless population in the state's public school districts rose by more than 3,000 between 2016 and 2018 to more than 23,000.
The report defines homeless as students who lack a fixed and adequate home, including those living in shared housing, motels or trailers, and cars, public spaces, or abandoned buildings.
“We're counting the real universe," said Kate Barrand, CEO of Horizons for Homeless Children, a nonprofit group. “We see about 3,000 children in Massachusetts right now, on any given night, in shelters. That's all that fits in the emergency assistance rooms. That doesn't mean that's all of the homeless."
Sarah Slautterback, state coordinator for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth program, said the increase stems in part from more accurate and consistent reporting but also reflects the scarcity and high cost of housing in Massachusetts.
“It's a clear indicator that there's not enough housing around," she said. “Our families on low income and fixed income are not able to keep up."
Barrand also cited the area's high cost of living as a leading factor behind the increase.
“We see gentrification of neighborhoods that used to be more affordable and suddenly we see million-dollar condos going in," she said, citing developments in traditionally lower-income neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roxbury.
Slautterback said the increase also coincides with a surge of Puerto Rican students enrolling in Massachusetts schools after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Most of the students were counted as homeless, she said.
The National Center for Homeless Education collects data on the demographics and academic performance of homeless students through state submissions to the US Department of Education.
Nationally, more than 1.5 million students were reported as experiencing homelessness at some point during the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 school years. In those years, the number of students experiencing homelessness increased by 15 percent.
In Massachusetts, Boston, Worcester, and Springfield have the most homeless students enrolled in their public schools.
Slautterback said some school districts help families who are struggling to find stable housing, but the search can be difficult.
“There are limitations to how far [these efforts] are going to go," Slautterback said. “Housing is just plain scarce in some of these places. We're here, we're working with families, but we can't find any housing to move them into."
In Boston, City Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George plans to present a legislative package to support the 5,000 students in the city's public schools who experience homelessness.

Texto completo: A new documentary series debuts on Apple TV Plus. And a new adaptation of Nick Hornby's "High Fidelity" hits Hulu.
What's Streaming
VISIBLE Stream on Apple TV Plus. Janet Mock, Margaret Cho, Asia Kate Dillon, Neil Patrick Harris and Lena Waithe narrate episodes of this new documentary series, which looks at the history of L.G.B.T.Q. representation on television and the role of TV in the story of L.G.B.T.Q. rights in America. The series pairs archival footage and interviews with celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey, Anderson Cooper, Billy Porter, Rachel Maddow and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. "Something about being on television," Maddow says in the first episode, "makes people see you as part of a country, as part of our culture, as part of who we are as a nation."
A SHAUN THE SHEEP MOVIE: FARMAGEDDON (2020) Stream on Netflix. What would happen if a U.F.O. landed in a rural English town populated by anthropomorphic animals and inarticulate humans? Find out in this follow-up to the 2015 family comedy "Shaun the Sheep," created by the British stop-motion studio behind the "Wallace and Gromit" franchise. Neil Genzlinger called that first movie "a charming and clever concoction" in his review for The New York Times, and with any luck that will hold true here. The first act of "Farmageddon" includes a farm machine being commandeered by an alien and a sheep, a slice of pizza being lifted into the air by supernatural means and a brief shot of a car repair shop named "H.G. Wheels Autos."
HIGH FIDELITY Stream on Hulu. "High Fidelity," Nick Hornby's 1995 novel about a record store owner with a flagging love life, had its London setting changed to Chicago for the 2000 film adaptation with John Cusack. The setting shifts again in this new, gender-flipped streaming TV adaptation, which sets the story in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The show introduces Rob, the character once played by Cusack, who is reimagined here by Zoë Kravitz. (An intriguing choice: Kravitz's mother, the actress Lisa Bonet, was in the movie version of "High Fidelity.") The plot involves Rob revisiting relationships from her past while slinging vinyl. While many elements have been rethought, the basics will be familiar to fans of the movie or the book -- who include Kravitz herself. "'High Fidelity' was one of the few pieces of art that my parents had been a part of that I was really able to separate from them," Kravitz said in a recent interview with The Times. "It's a weird thing, because it can be really uncomfortable and strange watching your mom kiss John Cusack or whatever, but it became a film that I loved and watched and could quote."
What's on TV
THE BEST OF ENEMIES (2019) 7:45 p.m. on Showtime. Taraji P. Henson stars opposite Sam Rockwell in this historical drama, based on a real-life friendship between Ann Atwater, a civil rights activist, and C.P. Ellis, a Klansman who renounces his ideology. The actual history is "eye-opening and inspiring," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, but the movie "lurches from folksy comedy to clattering melodrama, producing the opposite of enlightenment."

Texto completo: A curbside kiosk in Midtown Manhattan has rotating toilet seat covers, classical music and an attendant.
There are freshly plucked ornamental grasses by the sink, and four gleaming toilets with sanitary seat covers that rotate between uses with the wave of a hand.
Black-and-white photos of old New York decorate the walls. Soothing classical music is piped in, along with heat on chilly days. A full-time attendant waits just outside for touch-ups and emergencies.
If you must go, there may be no better public restroom in all of New York City than the five-star experience now available in the heart of Manhattan.
"It's very elegant," marveled Yolanda Reyes, 53, a cleaning woman from Brooklyn who made a pit stop after getting off the subway. "It made me feel very comfortable."
The well-appointed bathroom, which reopened recently after a two-and-a-half-year makeover that cost nearly $ 600,000, sits in Greeley Square Park, on Broadway between 32nd and 33rd Streets, a quick dash from a major subway stop and the New York terminus of the PATH train, which connects Manhattan to New Jersey.
Finding a decent place to go after long commutes and big cups of coffee has never been easy in New York. Public bathrooms in subway stations, if there are any, or transportation hubs are often dark, grimy and cramped. Toilets get clogged, and toilet paper and soap go missing. The worst are to be avoided at all costs.
But a new breed of commuter bathrooms is coming to the rescue.
Amtrak has spiffed up tired old restrooms at Pennsylvania Station, the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere, with new terrazzo floors, sleek gray stalls and hands-free faucets and soap dispensers. In the men's room, there is a row of urinals by Toto, a luxury brand that is used in the bathrooms of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Mandarin Oriental.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is overhauling 200 bathrooms in airports and transit centers as part of a larger effort to improve amenities for travelers.
A second-floor women's bathroom at the Port Authority Bus Terminal has black granite counters, bright lights and mirrors that are perfect for primping. Attendants clean and move the lines along. A new family bathroom with a diaper-changing station has been added nearby.
Public bathrooms inside Jamaica Station, in Queens, for the AirTrain to Kennedy International Airport recently reopened after a gut renovation, with new amenities such as stainless steel faucets shaped like airplanes (with sloping handles for wings) and a mural of the Manhattan skyline.
"There is no reason for bathrooms to be unattractive," said Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, explaining that "bathrooms are frequently at the top of the list of what passengers focus on."
The Port Authority has also stepped up bathroom cleanings, and rolled out a system for monitoring feedback from bathroom users. The bathroom improvements will cost more than $ 118 million, of which about 20 percent is being financed directly by the authority, and the rest by private companies that are contracted to run its facilities.
Of course, New York City is still a long way from being bathroom-friendly.
Take the sprawling subway system, which has too few bathrooms for comfort. An informal look at subway bathrooms last year by The New York Times found that 51 of the 472 stations had working bathrooms. And some were -- to be blunt -- gross.
A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways, said all bathrooms are cleaned daily. In addition, bathrooms in two dozen stations have recently been targeted for deep cleanings and overdue repairs, and upgraded with "vandal-proof fixtures" such as bolted-in toilet paper holders and soap dispensers.
Now, the bathroom outside the PATH station has raised the bar for commuter bathrooms even more.
Inside the forest-green kiosk is a bright, airy space that feels surprisingly roomy for just 150 square feet. There are four unisex stalls, a long, communal sink with two faucets and even a skylight -- covered with opaque glass to prevent workers in nearby towers from seeing too much.
Luxe touches like the rotating seat covers, seasonal plants and classical music were copied from nearby Bryant Park, which has long had the Tiffany's of public restrooms.
The Greeley Square bathroom, though smaller than Bryant Park's, cost more than twice as much to fix up because of the plumbing, electrical and construction challenges of a bathroom in a curbside kiosk above subway and train lines.
"We cater to everybody from CEOs to homeless people," said Dan Biederman, who oversees the bathrooms in both locations as president of the 34th Street Partnership and executive director of the Bryant Park Corporation. "It's one of the few places where people interact. It's common space."
The Greeley Square bathroom is open seven days a week, and staffed by an attendant at all times. Its annual operating budget of $ 245,000 will be paid by the partnership.
"This helps me so much," said Philip Valoso, a food delivery worker who ran inside the other morning after asking the attendant to watch his electric bike. Usually, he said, he has to hold it between deliveries.
The bathroom has been a work in progress since it was built in 1999 in Greeley Square Park, a popular spot with tables, chairs and a statue of the park's namesake, the influential newspaper editor Horace Greeley.
It was one of the city's first public pay toilets, retrofitted with a Swedish-made unit that was so high-tech it required detailed instructions to be posted in seven languages.
But the bathroom, which had a self-cleaning, rotating floor, had to be closed whenever a part broke. Replacements had to be shipped from Sweden. "The entire floor rotated -- that was just asking for complications," recalled Mr. Biederman. "We gave up on the idea of an automated public toilet."
By 2010, it had become a free public restroom with standard toilets. But still, there were problems. The metal walls of the kiosk were so thin that the pipes froze and burst, flooding the bathroom. Drug users holed up inside. After a man overdosed, the bathroom was closed in 2017.
Since then, commuters like Joseph Rodrigues have been eagerly awaiting its return.
"I need it. People need it," said Mr. Rodrigues, 51, a shoeshine worker who says he has bought french fries at McDonald's just to use the bathroom. "New York does not have enough public bathrooms."
It even impressed Joe Dee, 68, a real estate executive who tries to avoid public restrooms. Mr. Dee grew up in the city and was scarred by the times he tried to use subway bathrooms that were dirty and taken over by transients.
But as Mr. Dee has gotten up in years, his bathroom needs have increased, too.
"This is beautiful," Mr. Dee said. "I love it. As an older man, I love it even more." The public restroom in Greeley Square Park is reopening after two years and a $ 600,000 renovation. "It's very elegant," marveled one recent visitor. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHANG W.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
JAY CAMPBELL AND CONOR HANICK at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 9 p.m.). Two of the most interesting young artists around play in a concert of three premieres: "Kern," a piece for cello and prepared piano by Marcos Balter; John Zorn's "The Rule of Three," for which they are joined by the flutist Tara Helen O'Connor and the vibraphonist Sae Hashimoto; and Natacha Diels's "Flight Patterns." Also at the Y, Amanda Majeski and Philippe Sly join the pianist Julius Drake for Wolf's "Italienisches Liederbuch" (Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.).
212-415-5500, 92y.org
'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 15, 12:30 p.m.; Feb. 18, 7:30 p.m.; through March 14). Phelim McDermott's Coney Island fairground production, cast with a retinue of sideshow performers, returns with Ben Bliss as Ferrando, Luca Pisaroni as Guglielmo, Gerald Finley as Don Alfonso, Nicole Car as Fiordiligi, Serena Malfi as Dorabella and Heidi Stober as Despina. Harry Bicket is on the podium, making him a rather busy man at the moment, given that he is also conducting the Met's "Agrippina." Speaking of Handel operas, devotees will note that Juilliard is putting on "Rinaldo" this Monday at Alice Tully Hall, with Nicholas McGegan leading a concert performance.
212-362-6000, metopera.org
DANISH STRING QUARTET at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 14 and 18, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 16, 5 p.m.). These three young Danes and their Norwegian friend conclude their survey of the Beethoven string quartets with some of the works that have drawn them such widespread acclaim. On Friday, they perform pieces such as the Op. 127; on Sunday, they do an immense program of the Op. 132 and the Op. 130, with the "Grosse Fuge" as its finale; and on Tuesday, they follow Op. 131 with Op. 135. Tickets are limited, so act now.

KIRILL GERSTEIN at Zankel Hall (Feb. 20, 7:30 p.m.). Gerstein has emerged in recent years as one of our most thoughtful pianists, beyond his immense technical ability, and this recital is a perfect example of his gift for programming. Much of it is rooted in folk music, particularly pieces by Haydn, Brahms and Liszt; some is contemporary, including a handful from Gyorgy Kurtag's "Jatekok" and an arrangement drawn from Thomas Adès's "The Exterminating Angel"; and the whole lot is balanced by works demanding the utmost virtuosity, above all Liszt's Sonata.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 20, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 21-22, 8 p.m.). Jaap van Zweden conducts Bruckner's Symphony No. 4 in these subscription concerts, but the real action comes before that. As if Renée Fleming singing Björk were not enough, there are also two songs by Anders Hillborg and the premiere of "When the World as You've Known It Doesn't Exist" by Ellen Reid, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for music last year.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 19-20, 8 p.m.; through Feb. 24). John Eliot Gardiner and this ensemble released one of the more consequential recordings of the Beethoven symphonies ever made back in 1994, one that remains notable for its sleek, fast period-instrument approach. They reprise that effort over five concerts here, in the first -- and likely the more interesting -- of two Beethoven cycles at Carnegie this season. Wednesday's performance puts the Symphony No. 1 in the context of works like "The Creatures of Prometheus" and excerpts from the opera "Leonore"; the other four concerts pair the remaining eight symphonies in numerical order.

Texto completo: "Real Life" follows a pivotal weekend in the life of a black gay student in the Midwest, something Brandon Taylor said was an effort to write himself into the campus-life genre he loves reading.
When he set out to write a novel, Brandon Taylor, a former doctoral student in biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, approached it like a scientist.
"I have this very technical approach to almost everything," he said during a video interview from Iowa, where he now lives. "If there is a problem, I first determine the parameters of the problem, and then I try to lay out a very systematic way of doing it."
He started with a series of lists: Reasons he had failed to write a novel (too concerned with inventing everything, problems with setting and time frame). Things he considered himself good at (tone, dialogue). Scenes he wanted in the book (a tennis match, a dinner party). He gave himself rules, setting a goal to write 10,000 words a day. "It began in this very mercenary place," he said, "but it moved to a place of genuine artistic interest."
The result is "Real Life," which Riverhead is publishing next week, a novel that merges two versions of him: Brandon Taylor the writer and Brandon Taylor the scientist.
When he was a boy growing up in a small community outside Montgomery, Ala., Taylor, now 30, dreamed of a career in medicine. "My entire life, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon," he said. "Because if you're a black boy from the South who is good at science, everyone is like, 'Oh, Ben Carson, you should be a neurosurgeon."'
[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of February. See the full list . ]
For just as long, he has been writing. "As a kid, I was always writing little stories, or trying to, but I never considered myself a good writer," he said. It hasn't always been easy for him to reconcile these two aspirations. When he signed up for his first creative writing class, he remembers thinking, "They're all English majors, and I study chemistry."
But it was Taylor's life as a scientist that enabled him to write "Real Life."
He began working on it while he was in his graduate biochemistry program. He spent most of his days in the lab, working on his experiments on nematode worms, so he wrote mainly at night. It took him five weeks to finish a manuscript. At one point, he threw it in the trash after two agents rejected it. "It felt like the universe was telling me that I wasn't good enough, and that my work wasn't worth sharing with the world," he said.
His roommate Antonio Byrd, a fellow Ph.D. student, fished it out. "I told him, I'm keeping this draft in my bedroom until you come to your senses," Byrd said.
Taylor also deleted the manuscript files from his computer, attempting to scrub the book from his life. A few weeks later, he found out he had received a fellowship from the Tin House summer writing workshop. Encouraged, he went back to his novel, recovering it from one of his rejected queries. "That kind of seems like a sign, too," he said.
Throughout his undergraduate years at Auburn University at Montgomery and graduate school in Wisconsin, he felt he had to choose between science or writing, and science often won. But when he received an acceptance letter from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, he decided that, this time, writing would win. "I could survive not having science, but I couldn't survive not having writing," he said.
"Real Life" follows one pivotal weekend in the life of Wallace, a black gay biochemistry Ph.D. student in the Midwest. Grappling with the death of his father, a nascent romance with a straight friend, the potential failure of his scientific work and a general sense that he doesn't fit into the predominantly white cohort of his university campus, Wallace must figure out whether he wants to continue on his path as a student or chart a different course.
Taylor knows that Wallace sounds a lot like him. Both are black gay scientists. Both are migrants to the Midwest by way of Alabama. Both have had confusing trysts with straight men. ("My life, in some ways, is just a series of inappropriate encounters with heterosexual men," Taylor joked.) And both have stood on the precipice of a scientific career and had to ask whether to walk back or leap.
But Wallace -- whose name is based on Mrs. Wallis from Ann Patchett's novel "Commonwealth," Taylor said -- is not Taylor. Instead, Wallace is an amalgam of Taylor's own experiences as well as those of other queer black people on college campuses, he said.
"We wanted to see us in a story, and we didn't have that," said Christopher Sprott, a friend and former roommate of Taylor's who is also black and queer.
The academic setting is one that Taylor gravitates toward as a reader -- some of his favorite novels include "The Idiot," by Elif Batuman; "The Marriage Plot," by Jeffrey Eugenides; "Harvard Square," by André Aciman; and "Fates and Furies," by Lauren Groff -- but he rarely sees people like himself when he reads them. He hopes "Real Life" changes that. "What I wanted to do was to take this genre and this milieu that I really respond to as a reader and to sort of write myself into it," Taylor said.
He channeled this desire into his first published piece of writing, the story "Cold River," which appeared in 2015 in Jonathan, a literary journal published by Sibling Rivalry Press. He wrote the story as an undergraduate student, after he had gone to a bookstore in Montgomery but couldn't find the queer books he was looking for. When he asked the clerk if they had them, he said, "the guy was like, 'We're a family store, we don't stock that kind of stuff here."'
Taylor considers himself primarily a short-story writer, but the desire to see people like him represented in literature led him to make his book debut with a novel. "I had this feeling no one was going to take me seriously until I write this novel," he said. "I'm going to write a novel so that people will let me write short stories in peace."
Stories are on the way. His next book is a collection, "Filthy Animals," which will also be published with Riverhead.
But now that Taylor has made space for himself in the world of novels, maybe he'll stick around, he said. "Over the summer, I was like 'Oh, maybe I will write another novel."'

An earlier version of this article misstated the publisher of the literary journal Jonathan. It is Sibling Rivalry Press, not Lambda Literary.

Texto completo: While at the Royal Shakespeare Company, he took several shows to Broadway. One didn't go so well. Terry Hands, a British director who led the Royal Shakespeare Company in England and in the 1980s took several productions to Broadway, including a well-regarded "Much Ado About Nothing" and the notorious musical flop "Carrie," died on Feb. 4. He was 79.
Theatr Clwyd in Wales, where he was artistic director for 18 years, retiring after directing a final "Hamlet" in 2015, posted news of his death. The location and cause were not given.
Mr. Hands was with the Royal Shakespeare Company for almost a quarter-century, joining it in 1966 to run Theatregoround, an outreach program. In 1978 he became joint artistic director with Trevor Nunn, and from 1986 until his departure in 1990 he was the company's chief executive.
One highlight of his tenure there was his work with the actor Alan Howard, whom he directed in an ambitious staging of Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 1," "Henry IV, Part 2" and "Henry V" at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1975, with Mr. Howard starting out as Prince Hal in the first play in the cycle and growing into the title character in "Henry V."
Another noteworthy pairing came in the 1980s, when Mr. Hands directed Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac" and Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing." Derek Jacobi and Sinead Cusack starred in both, as Cyrano and Roxane in the first and as Benedick and Beatrice in the second. Mr. Hands moved both productions to Broadway in 1984, running them in repertory.
"A few wrong notes and 'Cyrano de Bergerac' could become this year's Mel Brooks parody," Frank Rich wrote in his review in The New York Times. "But Mr. Hands has perfect pitch. This director's virtuosity is as impressive as his star's."
As for "Much Ado," Mr. Rich called it "an iridescent reverie, as delicate as the wind chimes that shimmer in Nigel Hess's exceptionally beautiful score."
"Cyrano" earned three Tony Award nominations and "Much Ado" seven, with Mr. Jacobi's Benedick winning him the best-actor prize. Mr. Hands was nominated for best director for that production, and his lighting design for each production -- he often did his own -- was also nominated.
"Doing this in America is obviously a gamble," he told The Times in 1984 when the two plays were about to open. "Pleasing people in New York is not easy, and Broadway is a sudden-death street."
He received confirmation of that in the most brutal of ways in 1988, when his production of "Carrie," a musical based on Stephen King's horror novel about a high school girl with telekinetic power, traveled to Broadway.
With music by Michael Gore, lyrics by Dean Pitchford and a book by Lawrence D. Cohen, the show had had a rocky start at Stratford-upon-Avon, but Mr. Hands, who directed, took it to New York anyway. Critics were unkind, to say the least. Mr. Rich, singling out a scene involving the slaughter of a pig, invoked another famous Broadway flop.
"Only the absence of antlers separates the pig murders of 'Carrie' from the 'Moose Murders' of Broadway lore," he wrote in his review.
"Carrie" closed three days after it opened and has been something of a theatrical reference point -- and not in a good way -- ever since. Mr. Hands, though, who during his Royal Shakespeare tenure had pushed to expand that company beyond its comfort zone, had known that failure was a possibility and had embraced the challenge.
"You can't deny that any show that begins with menstruation in the high school shower and ends with a double murder is obviously taking a risk," he told The Times a few months earlier. "But that's the attraction, too."
Terence David Hands was born on Jan. 9, 1941, in Aldershot, England, southwest of London, to Joseph and Luise (Kohler) Hands. He attended the University of Birmingham and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1964 and becoming a founder of the Everyman Theater in Liverpool.
His time at the Royal Shakespeare Company was punctuated by battles over public financing that ultimately wore him down.
"I'm haunted by the specter of endless revivals of 'Peter Pan' to pay for endless revivals of 'Peter Pan,"' he told The Associated Press in 1990 shortly before he left, referring to the J.M. Barrie play that has been a Christmas perennial.
He expressed the hope that his successor would escape the burden of "having to spend three-quarters of the day raising, saving or making money."
After leaving the Royal Shakespeare he worked as a freelance director until 1997, when he responded to a call from Theatr Clwyd, in northeastern Wales, which was on the verge of closing. He became its artistic director, bringing some stability to the finances and building a supportive audience.
"He saved the theater from closure -- this is actual truth, not hyperbole -- and protected it from ongoing public funding cuts," Tamara Harvey, the theater's current artistic director, said in a statement.
Mr. Hands's marriages to Josephine Barstow in the 1960s and Ludmila Mikaël in the 1970s ended in divorce. In 2002 he married Emma Lucia, a director, who survives him, along with a daughter from his second marriage, the actress Marina Hands; and two sons, Sebastian and Rupert, from a relationship with Julia Lintott.
In 2015, as he was directing his final production for Theatr Clwyd, The Daily Post of North Wales asked him to name the highlights of his tenure there.

Texto completo: The electric-car maker said the agency was also looking into contracts and "regular financing arrangements."
Tesla received a subpoena in December from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the electric-car maker to turn over information about its financial data and contracts, the company said in a filing with the agency on Thursday.
In the filing, Tesla also said the S.E.C. had closed a separate investigation into projections and statements the company made in 2017 about production rates of its Model 3 sedan.
It said the scope covered by the December subpoena included "Tesla's regular financing arrangements."
The S.E.C. had previously investigated statements from Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, about plans to take the company private. That investigation ended in 2018 with Tesla and Mr. Musk each paying a $ 20 million fine and Mr. Musk stepping down as chairman for three years.
The agency declined to comment, and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla also announced on Thursday that it planned to issue about $ 2 billion in new common stock, just two weeks after Mr. Musk told investors on a call that it "doesn't make sense to raise money."
"We're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly," he said at the time.
Mr. Musk plans to buy up to $ 10 million of stock from the new offering, the company said. Larry Ellison, a Tesla board member, plans to buy up to $ 1 million.
Since Tesla announced its fourth-quarter earnings late last month, its share price has risen nearly 40 percent, giving it a market value of about $ 145 billion. The stock's price has risen about 90 percent since the beginning of the year.
After opening lower on Thursday, Tesla shares ended the trading session with a gain of nearly 5 percent, at $ 804.

Texto completo: The Yannick Nézet-Séguin era begins in earnest, with the company's music director leading six productions.
The Yannick Nézet-Séguin era at the Metropolitan Opera will begin in earnest next fall, when he assumes his full workload as the company's music director -- conducting six productions, half of them new.
The Met announced on Thursday that Mr. Nézet-Séguin will open the season on Sept. 21 with the company's first new production of Verdi's "Aida" in more than three decades, starring Anna Netrebko. He will conduct two new stagings by the director Ivo van Hove: Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and, in its Met premiere, Jake Heggie's "Dead Man Walking." And he will lead revivals of Beethoven's "Fidelio," Gounod's "Roméo et Juliette" and Strauss's "Die Frau Ohne Schatten."
Mr. Nézet-Séguin had initially planned to start as music director next season, but agreed to take on the title two years early, in a limited capacity, to help the company recover from allegations of sexual misconduct against his predecessor, James Levine. Now he will be a more regular presence.
"What's great is he is approaching the Met repertoire like a big meal," Peter Gelb, the company's general manager, said in an interview. "He's doing everything."
The company also plans to mount its first production by Barrie Kosky, one of the most widely admired directors in opera: the Met premiere of Prokofiev's "The Fiery Angel." On New Year's Eve it will present an inventive new production of Mozart's "Die Zauberflöte," directed by Simon McBurney and conducted by Gustavo Dudamel. (But the Met plans to keep the abridged, English-language version of the retiring Julie Taymor staging as a holiday presentation for families in future seasons.)
Ms. Netrebko unveils Abigaille in Verdi's "Nabucco"; Angela Meade and Jamie Barton, a potent pairing at the Met in "Norma," join for Donizetti's "Roberto Devereux"; Anita Rachvelishvili reprises her galvanic Azucena in Verdi's "Il Trovatore"; and the tenor Javier Camarena stars in Bellini's "Il Pirata." Richard Jones's wicked staging of Humperdinck's "Hansel and Gretel" returns, in English, as the family holiday presentation.
The Met will go dark in February, when its sales have typically been slowest, and extend its season until June 5, taking some weeks formerly used by American Ballet Theater. There will be more of the Sunday matinees the company began this season: 22, up from the current 16, all of which will be followed by post-performance talks.
It's a big season, with 23 operas on offer. Here are the highlights, chosen by writers of The New York Times.
'Aida'
I confess I'll miss the Met's solidly gargantuan old "Aida" production. And the director Michael Mayer's track record with Verdi -- half-baked, Vegas-theme "Rigoletto," turgidly traditional "La Traviata" -- doesn't fill me with hope for his new staging's visual glamour or interpretive acuity. But it will offer Mr. Nézet-Séguin and Ms. Netrebko's first full production together, and an opening night cast -- also including Ms. Rachvelishvili, Piotr Beczala and Ludovic Tézier -- that probably can't be bettered in the world today. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Tristan und Isolde'
Christine Goerke, a celebrated Brünnhilde last season in the "Ring," is scaling a new Wagnerian summit: Isolde. She will sing it opposite Stuart Skelton's Tristan in Mariusz Trelinski's bleak but powerful production, opening Oct. 17, with a cast that also includes the frequent scene-stealer Günther Groissböck as King Marke. It will be the Met debut of the German conductor Hartmut Haenchen, 76, who has been praised for his Wagner performances at the Bayreuth Festival and at Dutch National Opera, where he was music director. MICHAEL COOPER
'The Fiery Angel'
The Met has waited a criminally long time to hire Mr. Kosky, one of the busiest directors in Europe. But he won't be making his debut quietly. His bawdy take on "The Fiery Angel" -- a Prokofiev rarity that opens Nov. 12 -- includes leather harnesses, profanely dressed nuns and a devil with a dildo. This production might not have shocked the jaded audience in Munich, where it originated. But Met regulars, get ready: Zeffirelli's "Bohème" this ain't. JOSHUA BARONE
'Fidelio'
Lise Davidsen's Met debut this season, in Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades," more than lived up to the hype, and made me eager for her return as Leonore in Beethoven's "Fidelio," beginning Nov. 30. The Met does not always observe anniversaries, but this revival, mounted the year of Beethoven's 250th birthday, features Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducting a strong cast that also includes Golda Schultz, Brandon Jovanovich, Tomasz Konieczny and Christian Van Horn. MICHAEL COOPER
'Don Giovanni'
The Tony Award-winning Mr. van Hove is making his Met debut on March 1 with this "Don Giovanni," which I saw at the Paris Opera last year. It bears his trademark aesthetic of brutal austerity and sexy desperation, with a besuited antihero straight out of "American Psycho." Don't expect a revelatory read of Mozart's opera, but do look forward to an improvement on the Met's defanged current production. JOSHUA BARONE
'Giulio Cesare'
Harry Bicket has become something of a house Handel conductor at the Met -- and especially after his vibrant "Agrippina" this season, I'm not complaining. Starting March 2, he leads two singers from that production, Kate Lindsey and Iestyn Davies, in a revival of David McVicar's effective, Bollywood-tinged "Cesare," alongside Kristina Mkhitaryan, Karen Cargill and Anthony Roth Costanzo. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Lulu'
Now that William Kentridge's staging of Berg's "Wozzeck" has come to the Met, it will be interesting to revisit his version of "Lulu," in a revival that stars Brenda Rae in the title role and opens March 5. While Mr. Kentridge's projected images move quickly across the stage, the resulting effect is more than mere flash; his filmmaking chops bring to life aspects of this opera that other stagings breeze past. SETH COLTER WALLS
'Rusalka'
Its lush score easily falling into heaviness, Dvorak's opera needs a sure hand at the podium. It's a challenging yet apt assignment for the Met debut of Jakub Hrusa, a rising Czech maestro who's already a regular with American orchestras, if not yet with American opera houses. The title role should be an intriguing fit for the magnetic soprano Sonya Yoncheva, who's joined by Mr. Beczala, superb as the Prince, on March 16. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Die Frau Ohne Schatten'
For all its baffling elements, Strauss's "Die Frau Ohne Schatten," a fairy tale rife with symbolism, may be his masterpiece. Herbert Wernicke's visually dazzling and profoundly humane 2001 production is returning on April 16 with an exciting cast: Klaus Florian Vogt and Elza van den Heever as the Emperor and Empress, and Michael Volle and Nina Stemme as the humble Dyer and his bitter wife. Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducts, and I hope he opts for leading a complete version of a long score often trimmed in performance. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
'Billy Budd'
The return of John Dexter's 1978 production of Britten's "Billy Budd," on May 21, may not seem so newsworthy. But it offers an arresting dramatic spectacle, with a stage-filling set showing a late 18th-century British warship. And the cast for this intense, achingly tragic tale looks enticing, including the appealing baritone Joshua Hopkins as the innocent Billy and the ardent tenor Matthew Polenzani as the guilt-ridden Captain Vere. And finally, after 23 years, the excellent conductor Simone Young will be back at the Met. ANTHONY TOMMASINI

Pentagon Tells Congress It Will Divert $3.8 Billion to Fund Southern Border Wall

Texto completo: The formal notification to Congress prompted bipartisan outcry and accusations that the administration had again overstepped its constitutional authority.
WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon plans to divert $ 3.8 billion intended for military equipment to the construction of a wall at the southwestern border, it informed lawmakers on Thursday, drawing bipartisan outrage and reviving a long-running battle with Congress over funding for President Trump's signature campaign promise.
The formal notification to Congress on Thursday, which was obtained by The New York Times, was the latest bid by Mr. Trump's administration to circumvent congressional control of federal spending and unilaterally seize funds that lawmakers had designated for other purposes to finance the construction of the wall. The move came on the same day that Mr. Trump confirmed that the national emergency he had declared almost exactly a year ago to allow him to take money Congress had allocated for other purposes and spend it on the border wall would remain in place for another year.
The Pentagon's decision to divert funds was greeted on Thursday with criticism by a few prominent members of Mr. Trump's party, who joined Democrats in saying the president's team had overstepped its constitutional authority by second-guessing congressional spending decisions.
"Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress," said Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. "Attempts to do so undermines the principle of civilian control of the military and is in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution."
Congress must act to protect its constitutional authority, he said.
Mr. Thornberry, who is retiring, supported the president's national emergency declaration and has voted to uphold it. But the announcement on Thursday would effectively cancel the purchase of a number of V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, which is partly manufactured in Mr. Thornberry's district, as well as additional congressional requests.
Democrats called Mr. Trump's plan the latest "theft" of resources and said it would harm national security in the name of a political stunt.
"Congress, not the president, has the power of the purse -- a power that cannot be nullified so the president can fulfill an outrageous campaign promise," Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders, said in a joint statement.
The Pentagon said the money it was diverting -- which would have gone to National Guard equipment, fighter jets, combat aircraft and ships -- would be transferred using a relatively obscure law that allows the Defense Department to build fences to counter drug smuggling.
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said while he had no quarrel with Mr. Trump's ultimate goal -- "I like the wall," he said -- he would have preferred that military funds not be raided to pay for it.
"I'll support the president on this," he said, "but I wish they'd find the money somewhere else."
Still, some Republicans whose districts would be harmed by the reallocation said they supported the president's move and blamed Democratic reluctance to fund the wall. The plan would also take money designated to purchase F-35 fighter jets, which are built in the Fort Worth district of Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee.
"Democrats have refused to work with us on border security, which has forced the president to redirect funds from other defense programs in the short term in order to secure the southern border," Ms. Granger said in a statement, adding that she was confident that jobs in and around her district would be protected. "The president has come up with a reasonable approach that will provide the funding necessary to address the border crisis without jeopardizing our national security."
Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Department of Homeland Security had asked last month for assistance in blocking drug-smuggling corridors, and the $ 3.8 billion would be used to build approximately 177 miles of fencing.
"We will continue to support D.H.S. and other agencies as needed to keep our homeland secure," Colonel Mitchell said.
With the new outline submitted Thursday, the administration will have earmarked more than $ 10 billion outside of what Congress has designated for the wall, to be transferred from military construction, counternarcotics and other programs. Democrats said Mr. Trump had been forced to resort to a "backdoor" means of funding the wall because Congress had repeatedly rejected his requests for money to pay for it.
"While some of our Republican colleagues will lament the president's decision, they enabled this theft by blocking our efforts to stop the president from raiding defense accounts," Representatives Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Pete Visclosky, Democrat of Indiana and the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with defense funding, said in a joint statement.
Mr. Visclosky sent a letter to the Pentagon rejecting the request, but the gesture is likely to be ignored. Democratic senators also raised concerns in a letter to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, declaring the move to be "divisive, but also poisonous to the relationship we seek on national defense matters."
The Pentagon funds are critical to Mr. Trump's mandate to build 450 miles of border wall by 2021, particularly because Congress has allocated only a fraction of what the president has demanded for the project: $ 1.375 billion for the 2020 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The administration has built nearly 120 miles of border wall so far, according to a Customs and Border Protection document, most of it on land owned by the federal government where damaged wall or vehicle barriers previously existed.
Mr. Trump has gained access to additional funds in part because of his national emergency declaration and in part by using authority to divert funds within the department. Bipartisan majorities in Congress have voted repeatedly to undo the president's national emergency declaration -- an action that can be taken every six months -- but Democrats have been unable to secure the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override a presidential veto.
The administration plans to redirect an additional $ 7.2 billion this year -- a figure that includes the $ 3.8 billion announced Thursday. A congressional official said lawmakers were preparing to receive another notice that funds designated for military construction projects would be transferred to the wall.
The American Civil Liberties Union said it would ask a federal court to block the transfer of funds as part of a broader lawsuit challenging the administration's national emergency declaration.
Previous transfers have also been challenged in court. A federal judge ruled last month that the president could move forward with the use of $ 3.6 billion in military construction funds while underlying litigation continued. In July, the Supreme Court also permitted the administration to use another $ 2.5 billion in military funding for the president's border wall while litigation proceeds.

Texto completo: Court documents revealed Manchester City tried to kill a UEFA investigation that could lead to a Champions League ban by claiming news media reports undermined the case.
Last spring, days after news reports revealed the English soccer champion Manchester City was facing expulsion from the Champions League, European soccer's governing body confirmed the club was indeed in danger. Its investigators had found the club had breached financial control regulations to such an extent that it recommended the team be punished.
Manchester City reacted furiously, arguing leaks to the news media had seriously undermined the integrity of the investigation. The damage to City's reputation, the team argued, was so serious that not only should the case be thrown out, but Manchester City also should be compensated by UEFA, the body that runs European soccer.
"UEFA has systematically breached, and continues to breach, its duty of confidence," Manchester City wrote in its submission to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, adding that "leaks" and the decision to refer the club for punishments had caused the club "serious harm and loss."
The details of City's reaction to the threat of punishment were published Wednesday by the court, which rejected the appeal in November but only released its report on the case this week. In a 35-page document rejecting City's appeal, the court detailed efforts by the club to bring an early end to a case that has captivated European soccer since details of City's so-called financial doping were first published after a leak of internal club documents in 2018.
A ruling on Manchester City's possible punishment had been expected late last year, and again last month. The delay of a resolution to the case has highlighted the difficulty the adjudicatory arm of UEFA's financial control body has had in coming to a final decision -- one that is likely to lead to an outcry, whatever decision is made.
Any failure to act on the recommendation of UEFA investigators would most likely be seen as a deathblow to the organization's efforts to impose financial controls on its member clubs. But any penalty, and especially one that sees Manchester City ejected from the Champions League, the world's richest club competition, will almost certainly lead to more legal action on behalf of the club, which is bankrolled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a billionaire brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates.
And the ability of wealthy teams to avoid punishment is not without precedent; last year, UEFA cleared another Gulf-owned team, Paris Saint-Germain, of breaching financial rules, even though the evidence had suggested there was a case to answer.
Manchester City has vigorously denied wrongdoing, and its officials have warned UEFA that they will mount an aggressive response to any effort to punish the club or bar it from the Champions League. "The accusation of financial irregularities are entirely false," City said in a statement. "The club's published accounts are full and complete and a matter of legal and regulatory record."
The case against Manchester City is rooted in the leak of a trove of internal documents obtained by a Portuguese computer hacker, Rui Pinto, and supplied to a group of European news media outlets, notably Germany's Der Spiegel. News reports about the documents suggested the team had deceived officials responsible for UEFA's cost control rules by misrepresenting the source of some of its sponsorship income, a key component in meeting regulations imposed on all teams participating in European club competitions.
That resulted in a monthslong investigation by a team led by the former Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme. News media outlets, including The New York Times, citing anonymous sources, reported that the outcome of the investigation was likely to be a recommendation that City, which had already been sanctioned for breaking the cost-control rules in 2014, faced a ban of at least one season from the Champions League, a trophy the club has never won but covets the most.
UEFA has never confirmed the recommendations of its investigators, only that they had referred the case to the organization's adjudicatory chamber for a ruling.
Leterme, the documents revealed, reacted furiously to the charge against his panel, known as the Club Financial Control Body.
"I must vehemently reject your allegations of unlawful activities, either by myself or by any of the members of the UEFA CFCB, in particular of its investigatory chamber," he wrote to City officials.
"Your allegations are groundless in the merits and unacceptable in tone. Please be advised that I will not continue such an exchange of correspondence and that I will not respond further to groundless accusations directed against me personally and/or against my fellow members."
In rejecting City's appeal, the court said its case was inadmissible because a ruling had yet to be made by UEFA's adjudicatory chamber. City, the court panel noted, could lodge another appeal when a final decision was made.
UEFA and City have not commented on the details in the court document released Wednesday, which in parts did criticize UEFA. The court suggested the governing body's behavior in a separate case involving A.C. Milan highlighted a "rather nontransparent internal policy." It also said the leaks, details of which remain confidential, and have not been linked directly to UEFA or any of its officials, were "worrisome."
The point that the panel questioned was how Leterme could be "so confident" the leaks did not come from his members.

Texto completo: On an international tour, the Venezuelan opposition leader looked strong. But at home, he faces a disillusioned base, an authoritarian leader and a pivotal moment for the country.
BOGOTÁ, Colombia -- When the leader of Venezuela's opposition landed in Caracas this week following a world tour meant to drum up support for regime change, his country's authoritarian ruler handed him neither an arrest, which would have galvanized supporters, nor the chance for a hero's welcome at the airport.
Instead, President Nicolás Maduro appeared to greet his rival, Juan Guaidó, with the same policy of slow strangulation that has drained the opposition of much of its momentum over the past year, cracking down on his movement enough to wear down its members, but without going so far as to spur the world to action.
Moments before Mr. Guaidó arrived, Mr. Maduro's supporters attacked journalists who were there to cover his arrival, punching them and dragging at least one woman by the hair. Once Mr. Guaidó landed, government backers chased him out of the airport, cutting off any plans he had to make a speech, and then attacked his car with traffic cones and at least one metal pole.
And as Mr. Guaidó slipped through, authorities arrested his uncle, accusing him, without presenting evidence, of bringing explosives into the country.
Hours later, Mr. Guaidó stood with a few hundred supporters in a plaza in an opposition stronghold in eastern Caracas and declared victory.
"I defied the dictatorship and I entered the country," he said. "Venezuela is going to be democratic and free."
Mr. Guaidó also said he would be announcing the creation of a "Venezuela Fund," a multilateral program meant to help the country recover from its long and devastating economic crisis.
But he offered no other plan to remove Mr. Maduro. That, along with his chaotic arrival and the growing frustration among his base caused by the glacial pace of change, spoke eloquently about the challenges Mr. Guaidó is facing at home.
On Tuesday, as Mr. Guaidó arrived in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, Mr. Maduro's most powerful ally, Diosdado Cabello, mocked the size of the crowd that had come to receive him at the airport and belittled his movement.
Mr. Guaidó issued a direct challenge to Mr. Maduro a year ago, when he pointed to irregularities in Mr. Maduro's re-election and claimed to be the country's interim president, earning the support of millions of Venezuelans and dozens of foreign governments, including the United States.
Since then, despite the United State's use of crippling sanctions to hurt the country's economy and try to force the ouster of Mr. Maduro, Mr. Guaidó has not managed to seize power and call new presidential elections -- his stated goals.
On Jan. 19, he left the country to shore up greater support abroad, defying a travel ban imposed by Mr. Maduro's government. On his trip, he made headlines when he sat down with President Trump and was given a prominent place at the state of the union address. There, Mr. Trump championed the opposition leader's efforts.
Mr. Guaidó also met with Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France, and was welcomed by thousands of Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans in Florida.
Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, signaled that substantive action could be on the way, including sanctions on Russia's state-owned oil company, Rosneft.
Oil buoys the Venezuela economy, and Rosneft has been the country's main shipper of crude.
Internationally, Mr. Guaidó looked strong.
But at home, nothing had changed, and Mr. Maduro remained firmly in control of the country, playing what appears to be a long game of attrition.
Mr. Guaidó is also barreling toward a crisis point that poses a critical threat to the opposition, and to his claim to being the country's interim president.
The National Assembly, the legislature, is the last major political body in the country that the opposition claims to control. But 2020 is an election year for the assembly, and Mr. Maduro's opponents are divided over whether to participate.
If the opposition does take part, they risk legitimizing a potentially rigged election. If they don't, they risk handing control to Mr. Maduro.
Mr. Guaidó, so far, has not declared a position.
Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, said no matter what the opposition decides, Mr. Maduro is likely to take over the assembly this year.
But if Mr. Guaidó does not make a decision -- and soon -- he risks irrelevancy.
"There can be no more beating around the bush," Mr. Gunson said. "He has to be a leader."

Dyanne Thorne, 83, Star Of Scandalous 'Ilsa' Films

Texto completo: She was a sadistic Nazi doctor in "Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS," a 1975 sexploitation movie that has achieved cult status, then returned in several sequels.
Dyanne Thorne, who starred in one of the most notorious sexploitation movies of the 1970s, "Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS" -- a head-spinning mix of Nazi fetishism, sadism and female empowerment that is still talked about by grindhouse film aficionados as well as by more serious scholars -- died on Jan. 28 in Las Vegas. She was 83.
Her husband, Howard Maurer, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
Ms. Thorne began in show business as a singer and comedian before veering into risqué movies like "Sin in the Suburbs" (1964) and a version of "Pinocchio" decidedly not for children (1971).
The release of "Ilsa," though, in 1975, elevated her to an entirely different level of fame, at least among moviegoers of a certain stripe. The film and her character, a Nazi doctor with a taste for sex and torture, became cultural touchstones of sorts, inspiring, among other things, songs by several rock bands.
The movie, directed by Don Edmonds, begins with Ms. Thorne's character having sex with a prisoner and then presiding over his castration, her frequent punishment for those who do not satisfy her. "This was the sweetest actor in the world that they castrated," Ms. Thorne told the website Horror Cult Films in 2011.
Ilsa also conducts medical experiments on female prisoners, hoping to show that women can tolerate pain better than men and should therefore be allowed to serve in combat.
The movie, shot in nine days on the studio set once used by the prisoner-of-war sitcom "Hogan's Heroes," became an unexpected hit, catching on overseas as well as in certain markets in the United States, including New York, when it had a long run in a then-seedy Times Square.
"To our surprise, 'Ilsa' went through the roof," John Dunning, a founder of Cinépix Film Properties, the production and distribution company behind the film, wrote in his memoir, "You're Not Dead Until You're Forgotten" (2014, with Bill Brownstein), adding, "It played more than a year in Brussels alone."
The whip-wielding Ilsa was so popular that, even though she died at the end of the movie, she was brought back for "Ilsa: Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks" (1976) and "Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia" (1977). (Ms. Thorne also starred in another film released in 1977 under various titles -- "Ilsa: The Wicked Warden," "Wanda: The Wicked Warden" -- that is sometimes regarded as a sequel and sometimes not.)
Mr. Maurer said in a phone interview that Ms. Thorne, whom he married shortly after the first "Ilsa" movie was released, was simultaneously in demand and untouchable because of the reaction to "She Wolf." He ended up representing her in negotiations for the sequels because no agent would, he said.
Her interests outside of acting included, perhaps incongruously, the ministry. She was an adherent of Science of Mind, a religious movement established in the 1920s by Ernest Holmes, and was an ordained nondenominational minister, Mr. Maurer said.
The two of them had a wedding business in Las Vegas, with Ms. Thorne generally writing the ceremonies and Mr. Maurer, a musician, providing music. Some clients would opt for an "Ilsa wedding."
"She would do it in costume, in some of the things she wore in the films that we still had," Mr. Maurer said (though never, he added, with any swastikas). "She would put in little nuances from the films that every fan recognized. Sometimes she'd use the whip. It was all done tongue in cheek."
She did her last Ilsa wedding in November.

She was born Dorothy Ann Seib on Oct. 14, 1936, in Park Ridge, N.J., to Henry and Dorothy (Conklin) Seib. She was raised largely by her mother, who held various jobs, including seamstress and jeweler, Mr. Maurer said. She took courses at New York University and studied acting, including with the teacher Uta Hagen, he said.
The theater was her first interest. She was a "Casino Cutie" in the original cast of "This Was Burlesque," a revue that opened at the Casino East Theater in Manhattan in 1962 and ran for more than 1,000 performances before transferring to Broadway in 1965 (although by then Ms. Thorne was no longer in the cast).
She also appeared in skits on Jack Paar's variety show and similar TV programs in the early and mid-1960s.
Mr. Maurer said a happenstance of wardrobe helped Ms. Thorne win the "Ilsa" role. She had a part-time job as a chauffeur at the time and arrived at the audition straight from a driving shift wearing her uniform.
"She walked inside in this chauffeur's jacket and jodhpur pants," he said, "and one of the guys said, 'That's her!"'
The movie was loosely inspired by the life of Ilse Koch, the sadistic wife of the commandant of two concentration camps, Sachsenhausen and then Buchenwald.
The movie won Ms. Thorne so many fans that some were still lining up to chat with her at autograph conventions years later. Vincent Canby, however, the courtly film critic for The New York Times, was not one of them.
When he saw the movie, or at least part of it, in 1975 for an article that carried the headline "Now for a Look at Some Really Bad Movies," among the things he didn't care for was her attempt at a German accent.
"At the point I walked out of the theater," Mr. Canby wrote, "she was having an argument on the telephone with a superior officer whom she repeatedly addressed as 'Hair Gain-hay-ral."'

DANIEL SLOSS at SoHo Playhouse (Feb. 14-15, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 17-19, 8:45 p.m.; through March 1). This Scottish stand-up followed two Netflix comedy specials in 2018 with one for HBO in 2019, "Daniel Sloss: X." It explores the fragility of the male ego as well as the reckoning of the #MeToo movement on toxic masculinity -- for laughs, of course. Sloss just has a dark sense of humor, but he can work clean enough to rack up 10 appearances so far on "Conan." He's using this mini-residency to develop his "new work." Tickets are still available for Wednesday, as well as for the performances on Feb. 26, 27 and March 1; for the other nights, you can try your luck on the waiting list, which opens at the box office two hours before showtime.
212-691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com
'TINDER LIVE! WITH LANE MOORE' at Littlefield (Feb. 14, 8:30 p.m.). If you haven't found a Valentine, then you can find solace in your self-partnership by watching Moore swipe through Tinder profiles and interact with potential matches. All the while, you and Moore's special guests provide running commentary. This month, those guests include Dylan Marron, the "Slate" columnist Jamilah Lemieux and the author Ada Calhoun. An Anti-Valentine's Day Dance Party, which charges separate admission, follows the show.

'YOUR LOVE, OUR MUSICAL' at Caveat (Feb. 14, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman pick out an actual couple from the audience, ask them how they met and fell in love, and then improvise a full musical (complete with a live band) about that couple. Jason Zinoman wrote in The New York Times that the result is "a fluidly structured, tuneful show."

Texto completo: A bungled quarantine announcement showed how Japan has struggled to deal with a spreading coronavirus challenge, including with the country's first death.
TOKYO -- For a moment on Thursday, John and Carol Montgomery thought they might be departing early from the cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, where new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed almost daily.
Japan's health minister said a few categories of passengers could spend the remainder of the two-week quarantine ashore. The Montgomerys thought they qualified because they share a cabin without windows or a balcony and Mr. Montgomery, 68, has diabetes.
Their hopes were quickly dashed. The health minister's statement, it turned out, had been ambiguous. The captain of the vessel, the Diamond Princess, announced narrower criteria for offshore quarantine: passengers 80 or older with underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins.
"Looks like we're not going anywhere," said Ms. Montgomery, 67.
The misunderstanding punctuated what critics call Japan's bungled communications during the crisis, reinforcing how the nation has been vexed by an epidemiological challenge that grows each day. With more and more of the Diamond Princess 3,400 anxious passengers and crew getting sick -- possibly infecting one another -- health officials have even raised the possibility of prolonging the quarantine, now set to expire next Wednesday.
Precisely how the coronavirus has been spreading aboard the ship is just one of many unknowns in the affliction's reach into Japan. The country also announced its first death from the coronavirus, of a woman in her 80s in Kanagawa Prefecture, which includes Yokohama.
The authorities said the woman did not appear to have traveled to China, the center of the epidemic, before falling ill. Her death was the third so far outside mainland China; the others were in the Philippines and Hong Kong.
Japan's health ministry also announced 44 new coronavirus cases from the ship, raising the total to 218. Counting those from the vessel, total cases in Japan have surpassed 250, the most of any country other than China.
The clumsy messaging aside, the move by the health ministry to begin letting some people off the Diamond Princess was clearly a response to mounting stress on board as the quarantine slogs toward its planned conclusion in less than a week. The step also reflected the particular risk that the virus appears to pose to the elderly.
"People in the ship's surroundings are kind of in a cesspool of probability of being infected," said Dr. Peter Katona, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
"We don't really understand the transmission of this virus very well," he added. "So I think that keeping people in their rooms and letting them out briefly is about as good as you are going to be able to do on a ship, but the psychological impact of that is hard to measure."
The health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the government would consider expanding the criteria to include passengers under 80 years old in the coming days.
According to a document distributed to several embassies by Japan's foreign ministry and seen by The New York Times, the Japanese government is discussing plans to administer coronavirus tests to people aboard the ship in tranches to determine if more can be quarantined onshore. Some passengers have been calling for testing of everyone on board, a step the government has called impractical.
Their psychological stress worsened on Thursday as the health ministry announced the new cases. The authorities have said that a small number of the 218 infected are in serious condition.
"I have worked hard to stay calm, but now it's getting so much harder," Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., said in a text message. "It appears that we are put at risk daily by staying on the ship."
Some epidemiologists said it was possible that the bulk of the people receiving diagnoses now had contracted the virus before the quarantine began on Feb. 4. The outbreak has been traced to a man who disembarked from the ship on Jan. 25 in Hong Kong and later tested positive.
For more than a week after his departure, passengers shared buffets, sat close to each other in theater performances and played mahjong on deck.
"The curve you're seeing is a natural epidemiological wave," said Dr. Allen Cheng, an infectious disease specialist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. "The first person may have infected a number of people, and those secondary cases have caused tertiary cases, and what we're seeing now is the natural incubation of those tertiary cases."
With crew members living and eating in close quarters, the chances for new infections rises the longer everyone stays on the ship. The danger was underlined on Wednesday when the health ministry announced that one of its own officials had been infected after helping to evaluate passengers and crew members for symptoms. The official had been wearing a mask and gloves but not a hazardous materials suit.
"There is a possibility that infections have spread despite the fact that passengers have been isolated on board," said Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a professor of molecular epidemiology at Jikei University Hospital in Tokyo. "It's better to let them off, as we don't know the cause of infection at this stage."
Passengers were growing concerned that the longer they stayed on board, the longer the quarantine could be extended for passengers who are potentially exposed to confirmed infections.
"The logic and the basis for the quarantine is that if people do not have a fever or show signs of sickness after 14 days, that they don't have the virus," Mr. Montgomery, the passenger, said. "But the problem is, on this petri dish of a ship, is that three days prior to the 19th, we may have an interaction with somebody in the hallway or on the deck" who is infected.
On Wednesday, he said, when the couple went out for a prescribed fresh air break, another passenger was coughing in the hallway as they returned to their cabin.
"So this whole thing is based on a false logic," he said.
In a briefing earlier this week, Masami Sakoi, a health ministry official, said it was possible that people exposed to infected passengers would have to effectively reset the clocks on their quarantine periods.
Ms. Montgomery suggested that the governments of the countries with passengers or crew members on the Diamond Princess should offer to house people in quarantine facilities on land.
"If the U.S. embassy took the Americans off and took us away from here and quarantined and tested us and they did that with every nationality, I think that would be more effective," she said.
Even so, finding space where such a large number of people could be safely isolated and given proper medical care could be a challenge, especially as Japan is now seeing fresh cases elsewhere. On Thursday, the health ministry announced three new cases, involving a taxi driver and a doctor, in addition to the death from the coronavirus.
"With those waves of new infections every day, that would challenge the most resilient person's sense of security," said Benjamin Cowie, an infectious disease physician at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. "But that's a very substantial number of people to then try to have to quarantine anywhere on the shore."
Even with the rising stress, some passengers were making the best of their time trapped on board. Aun Na Tan, 43, an administrator from Australia who is sharing a windowless cabin with her husband, 44, and two teenage children, said they were playing card games and watching movies together while her husband works remotely and her children keep up with homework online.
In such close quarters, Ms. Tan said, "my daughter hops into my bed for a cuddle every now and then. I'm just enjoying the opportunity. They get less and less as she gets older."
Even some who might be eligible to quarantine off shore said they would stick it out on the ship.
"Luckily, we're staying in a stateroom that's slightly larger, so we're fine with it," said Masako Ishida, 61, who is traveling with her mother and stepfather, who are in their 80s. "We wouldn't mind at all if we're the last ones to disembark, as long as those in need can leave the ship. It would be easier if we stayed here until the 19th and relax."
