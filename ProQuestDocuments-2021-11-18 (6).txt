Texto completo: Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner swats the ball during a game against the York Yankees in 1986. Photo by Joe Gromelski
Long ago, in an era when the Boston Garden was still standing and Fenway Park had yet to install Green Monster seating, there were two Boston professional athletes whose actions during the postseason affected the destiny of their respective teams.
John (Hondo) Havlicek stole the ball in Game 7 of the 1965 NBA Eastern finals. Bill Buckner allowed a routine ground ball to slip through his legs in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series.
Havilcek was the talk of Beantown for years after his decisive act at the Boston Garden. He was lauded by adoring fans who witnessed sports history. Spectators would be forever enamored by the 6-foot-5 Celtic swingman, who steered Boston to numerous NBA titles.
Who hasn’t heard the recording of announcer Johnny Most bellowing, “Havlicek stole the ball! Havliceck stole the ball. It’s all over, it’s all over?” I have an early copy of the “Havlicek Stole The Ball” alblum, which was released in 1967. It is a precious possession and a time capsule of when the Boston Celtics ruled the NBA with players like Hondo, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and Bill Russell.
Buckner, on the other hand, incurred the wrath of belligerent Red Sox fans, who wanted to tar and feather him on Boston Common. His gaffe soured fans, who were reeling from the frustrations of a team that hadn’t prevailed in the World Series since 1918.
That’s a long drought, which would continue until 2004.
Fans felt betrayed and their outrage over Buckner’s blooper simmered for years. They would never let him forget the mishap, which I will never understand. It was like Buckner committed crimes against the state — or worse — he jumped ship to the Evil Empire — the New York Yankees.
Whether it’s the NFL, NBA or a high school game, athletes falter and teams lose because of an error, a blown call or a team went on sabbatical at the wrong time in the postseason,
But here’s the thing — nobody died! Fans went home to live another day and root for their favorite teams.
Ruthless fans felt they had just experienced the apocalypse, believing Buckner’s error at first base cost the team a World Series. He was a treated like a pariah long after that damn ground ball got away from him.
Let’s rewind the tape and look back at Buckner’s blunder in the 10th inning of Game 6 against the New York Mets, who were down 5-3 with two outs and the bases empty. Before the blunder, Sox pitcher Calvin Schiraldi gave up three consecutive singles and a run, with runners holding up at third and first base.
Bob Stanley came in relief of Schiraldi, but Stanley threw a wild pitch at Mookie Wilson and the runner scored from third base to tie the game. The other runner, Ray Knight, moved to second.
With a full count, Wilson sent a ground ball down the first base line to Buckner, but the ball scurried through Buckner’s legs and into the outfield, and Knight crossed home plate to score the winning run for the Mets.
The error, along with some timely hitting in Game 6, gave the Mets a second chance in Game 7, which they won 8-5, along with the World Series title.
Sure, my father and I were disappointed as we grumbled about another missed opportunity for the Sox to win a World Series in our lifetime.
We were joined to the hip when it came to Boston sports. My uncle, A.J. Blasi, a teacher who worked part-time at fabulous Fenway Park, had the privilege of getting into a loud argument with the irascible Ted Williams when my uncle mentioned Wade Boggs’ batting success. My mom and dad attended Williams’ last game of his career at Fenway on Sept. 28, 1960, while I was knocking the stuffing out my Teddy Bears in a crib.
It proves fans’ passion for their teams run deep in Beantown.
But some fans wouldn’t let it go and continued to point the finger at the 20-year MLB veteran, who piled up 2,715 hits and 174 runs, as the reason for the Sox’s failure in 1986.
“You can never really forget it because it comes up all the time,” Buckner told the New York Times in 2011. “I’m a competitive guy, so it’s something I didn’t enjoy. But for some reason, the stars were all lined up just right for the Mets that year, and here we are, 25 years later, still talking about it.”
One of the Celtics’ finest moments came when Havlichek stole an inbounds pass by the Philadelphia 76ers’ Hal Greer with seconds left in the game. Boston was holding on for dear life with a 110-109 lead. The Celts went on to capture another NBA title thanks Havlichek, who eventually scored 26,000 points in his 16-year career.
Havlichek reveled in glory. Buckner was remembered as a scapegoat for years.
John Joseph Havlichek, born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, died on April 25, 2019, at age 79.
William Joseph Buckner, born in Boise, Idaho, died on May 27, 2019, at age 69.
Two great athletes, who became household names due to their daring exploits on the basketball court and baseball diamond, are lost forever — and hopefully the anger that was directed toward Buckner.
It took courage for Buckner to move on and not allow one play in a successful 20-year baseball career to define him as a human being.
As parents and fans, we should all restrain our indignation the next time your kid or favorite pro athlete misplays a fly ball or drops the winning pass in the end zone.
It is tiresome and pathetic all at the same time.

Katrina Spade, the founder and CEO of Recompose, a company that hopes to use composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains, poses for a photo in a cemetery in Seattle. Spade is hoping to open the first recomposition, or human composting, facility in Seattle by late 2020.

Gov. Jay Inslee, center, talks May 21 with Katrina Spade, upper left, the founder and CEO of Recompose, a company that hopes to use composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains, before signing a bill into law that allows licensed facilities to offer “natural organic reduction.” Washington is the first state in the nation to allow human composting.

Washington is the first state to legalize human composting. This is a rendering of what a Recompose facility for natural organic reduction could look like.

The vessel is then turned gently over 30 days and a stream of warm air is applied, with about two wheelbarrows worth of soil returned at the en

Grandpa's old apple tree has a whole new meaning.
This year, Washington became the first state in the U.S. to legalize natural organic reduction, a process of converting human remains into soil that has been casually referred to as “human composting.”
Senate Bill 5001 offers two new post-death alternatives to burial and cremation, the only legal options available in Washington.
“The main purpose is to provide more options to people in terms of how they can dispose of their own remains and those of their loved ones,” said state Sen. Jamie Pedersen, the Seattle Democrat who pre-filed the bill. “There are people who are very troubled by the environmental consequences with the current means of disposing with remains.”
In addition to natural organic reduction, or recomposition, as it is called in S.B. 5001, the bill also allows a process called alkaline hydrolysis, which dissolves bodies using potassium hydroxide or lye in a pressurized vessel. Alkaline hydrolysis is already legal in more than 15 states, but recomposition likely isn't legal anywhere in the world, according to a New York Times story.
“It's just amazing that we have this completely universal experience of dying and we live in a world that has been transformed over 100 years, or 50 years, or 10 years, or even five years by technology — and yet technology has not really helped us with this universal experience of what to do with dead bodies,” Pedersen said. “Because the law continues to say — or at least it will until next May — continues to say that the only permitted means of disposing with remains are burial and burning, which have been with us for thousands of years.”
Pedersen said cremation and burial are more costly and worse for the environment than recomposition, which involves placing a body in a vessel with mostly wood chips and straw. The vessel is then turned gently over 30 days and a stream of warm air is applied, Pedersen said, with about two wheelbarrows worth of soil returned at the end.
Families can then spread that material as they see fit, said Katrina Spade, who founded Recompose and aims to open the first recomposition facility in Seattle in late 2020.
“We have this beautiful, nutrient-rich soil, let's go grow a tree that generations of our family can know came from this one person. It's a really nice way to leave a legacy,” Spade said.
Spade explained that for every person who chooses recomposition over cremation or burial, about a metric ton of carbon will be saved. Washington State University conducted a study last year on six donated bodies and found that recomposition is safe and effective. Pedersen said that at a bill hearing, one woman who was a friend of one of those six who donated their body, testified her friend found comfort in leaving the Earth in an environmentally friendly way. That woman's soil was spread in a garden.
“On the one hand, it's sacred. It feels very important, the material we're creating,” Spade said of the soil. “On the other hand, it's just soil. We get to cease to be human in the process. Molecular change happens, and we get to be back to nature. It's an interesting paradox to be very simply dirt and be sacred.”
Spade started pondering recomposition in graduate school while considering her own mortality, and how she wasn't fond of either cremation or burial.
State Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, also sponsored the bill. Pedersen called her an “early and enthusiastic” proponent of the bill. Rivers didn't respond to calls or a text from The Columbian. Spade said people from Clark County can send remains to the Seattle facility and have the soil returned to them.
Pedersen said the response to the bill has been generally positive. It passed the House and Senate easily with bipartisan support. Pedersen said some concerns come from not understanding the process of recomposition.
“Part of the problem is that a lot of people when they hear ‘composting' have this vision in their mind of Uncle Mel or grandpa being thrown out in the backyard in a heap of food scraps with the extra carrots and beef stew tossed on top of him left to rot,” Pedersen said. “Obviously, that's very different from the process that's approved.”
Pedersen has heard from government officials in California and as far away as New York, who are interested in recomposition. He thinks the idea will continue to spread. He added that he would consider recomposition when he dies, although he called himself traditional and said he still might like some kind of marker with his soil. Spade knows this is the option she wants.
“This is the option I want, but I think the caveat is I would like to stick around for another 30, 40, 50 years,” Spade said with a laugh. “So it's hard for me to really put myself in that position, but I absolutely would choose to be reduced via natural organic reduction for sure.”

Texto completo: First son-in-law Jared Kushner's quest for a White House security clearance was derailed by allegations he used a pass key to illicitly enter a Trump Tower apartment, a bombshell new book reveals.
Kushner's aim was to steal a computer belonging to a friend of the estranged wife of Ken Kurson, the editor of the New York Observer, author Michael Wolff says in a White House tell-all book, "Siege."
Kushner was the Observer's owner and publisher until 2017. It is now owned by a trust controlled by Kushner's family.
The revelation sheds some light on the ongoing mystery over why Kushner, one of President Trump's most trusted White House advisers, never got top secret clearance.
According to the best-selling author, whose first Trump administration book sold 4 million copies, Kushner saw himself as a "problem solver" in the White House. But by the spring of 2018, as the Mueller probe surged forward, Kushner became just another problem.
Kushner's clandestine operation came to light after he tried to get Kurson, one of his cronies, a spot on the board of the National Endowment of the Arts.
It was during Kurson's background check for the post in the spring of 2018 that the FBI delved into sordid claims that the ex-scribe had stalked his wife's best friend, a doctor at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital.
"The doctor was holding emails and other electronic information that might be damaging to Kurson, information not only related to the marriage but potentially to the New York Observer and Kushner," Wolff writes in the book.
The doctor was so worried about her safety, The New York Times reported, that Mount Sinai arranged for a chaperone to escort her to and from work. Kurson and his wife "in better days" had helped the doctor lease her apartment in Trump Tower, the book says.
"Prosecutors and the FBI had been told that Kushner, using a pass key from the building, had entered the doctor's apartment seeking to take her computer," Wolff writes.
The book doesn't say if the FBI or the Brooklyn federal prosecutors ever confirmed the allegation, but Kushner, through his lawyer, denied the veracity of the claim.
"Like so many other things that Wolff has written and said, this is 100% false and completely crazy," said a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, Kushner's lawyer.
The New York real estate scion was originally denied a top security clearance, according to reports, for foreign influence, private business interests and personal conduct.
Kurson and his ex-wife did not respond to requests for comment.

Texto completo: Discontent in Baltimore is usually high at this time of the spring as Orioles fans already watch their playoff hopes fade. But this year local residents have more to be angry about. For more than three weeks the city government's computers have been offline. That means no emails have been going in or out of city hall, and the systems used to settle parking fines, pay water bills, property taxes and more are out of commission. These are online systems that most of us take for granted -- until they stop working.
Baltimore's IT infrastructure is being held hostage by ransomware, the malicious code used to hijack online systems and extort users for payment. The hackers' ransom note demanded their payment in cryptocurrency: 13 bitcoins (worth about $100,000) in exchange for total control, or an a la carte option of 3 bitcoins per computer system. Mayor Jack Young has rightly refused to pay these nameless and faceless criminals. But pressure is mounting to find a solution.
Failing that, some city officials thought they'd at least found an excuse when the New York Times reported over the weekend that a "cyber weapon" stolen from the National Security Agency in 2017 had "boomeranged back" against Baltimore. City Council President Brandon Scott is now pointing his finger at the neighboring spy agency and petitioning the federal government for reparations in the form of emergency funds to cover most of the estimated $18.2 million in damages.
Nice try, Mr. Scott. Baltimore faces an emergency, but it's not of the NSA's doing. It's true that the city government's vulnerability resides in old Microsoft software that, according to former NSA employees, the NSA had been lawfully exploiting for years to gather intelligence. The NSA disclosed the bug to Microsoft in 2017 after the spy agency reportedly learned that its tool had been stolen by a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers. Microsoft promptly released a "patch," an update that would render the hacking tool useless. But two years later, Baltimore still hasn't implemented the fixes across its vulnerable infrastructure.
These troubles are not unique to Baltimore; the same malware has been reported in Texas and Pennsylvania. Last year the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey unsealed an indictment against two Iranians who, beginning in 2015, allegedly unleashed ransomware on more than 200 victims, including municipal governments, state agencies and hospital networks in 43 states. That two hackers can wreak havoc with tens of thousands of systems, causing $30 million in damages, should trouble all Americans who entrust state and local governments with personal information and rely on them for critical, sometimes lifesaving, services.
So who's at fault? It would be easy to blame Baltimore's elected officials and their technology staff for not fixing their systems. I might do so myself if not for my experience maintaining a vast and federated array of legacy infrastructure during my tenure in state government. Updating and repairing a network of old servers comes at a massive cost, with significant human-capital requirements that place governments at a unique disadvantage relative to industry, which has far more access to funding and talent. I also spent countless hours on the phone with municipal ransomware victims as they weighed two bad options: Give in to the hackers' demands and hope for the best, or refuse to pay and deprive constituents of services.
These attacks will continue and intensify unless two things happen. First, software and hardware manufacturers must begin to cater to the lowest common denominator when building hacking-mitigation techniques into their products. Governments and companies should be able to easily patch their computers the way ordinary consumers update their iPhones. Only then can we reasonably transfer more liability from the technology's makers to its users and elevate barriers to entry for hackers. For now, more liability should reside with the makers.
Second, the federal government must find and bring to justice bad actors in cyberspace. Someone, somewhere is responsible for waging a digital assault on an American city. Instead of blaming the NSA, Baltimore's officials should ask for its help in tracking down these criminals. Perhaps the NSA can also lend Baltimore a hand in getting back online.
In addition, members of Congress and executive-branch officials should debate when and how the NSA discloses software bugs to U.S. and foreign companies. The public deserves greater assurances that NSA tools won't fall into the wrong hands.
The Trump administration has done more than any previous administration to address this problem. In November 2017 it spelled out a transparent and fair process to "disseminate vulnerability information to the vendor/supplier in the expectation that it will be patched, or to temporarily restrict the knowledge of the vulnerability" to the U.S. government for national-security purposes. The man behind this transparency, former White House cyber czar Rob Joyce, also led the NSA unit that reportedly built the since-stolen tool.
The need to balance security and privacy is greater in the digital age than ever before. Let's not forget that Baltimore is a victim. It's time for governments and agencies to stop blaming each other and unite against the attackers.

Texto completo: What's on TV
DEADWOOD: THE MOVIE (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. David Milch's award-winning western series, which The New York Times recently named "one of the 20 best TV dramas since 'The Sopranos,"' returns to HBO over a decade after the network unexpectedly holstered it. "Deadwood: The Movie" brings back most of the cast of the series, which includes Ian McShane as the hard-drinking saloon owner Al Swearengen and Timothy Olyphant as the darkly contemplative Sheriff Seth Bullock, but moves the action a decade later, with the town of Deadwood inching toward modernity. The result is "not just a nostalgic exercise but a fair shorthand of what might have transpired in a fourth season," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The Times. "It can't, in its abbreviated run, recreate the series's full glory, but it does offer that glory a wistful toast." That's more than most would have expected before plans for the movie were announced. Many fans of the canceled-too-early series until recently undoubtedly shared the view that Olyphant recently expressed to The Times: "I didn't think it was ever going to happen."
QUIET STORM: THE RON ARTEST STORY (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. Metta World Peace, the former basketball player who was known during his years as an N.B.A. star as Ron Artest, is notorious for his role in the 2004 Malice at the Palace brawl. But that fight, which involved players of the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons and fans at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan, was just one chapter in the life of World Peace, who has become a voice for mental health awareness. This documentary, produced by Bleacher Report, follows World Peace's childhood in the Queensbridge public housing projects in New York, and goes from there.
UNIDENTIFIED: INSIDE AMERICA'S UFO INVESTIGATION 10 p.m. on History. This six-part series centers on a mysterious Pentagon U.F.O. program that was also the subject of a widely read article in The Times in December 2017. It features an interview with Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence official who ran the program until he resigned in 2017, and appearances by several others involved with reports of unidentified flying objects, including Navy pilots who have described unexplained sightings.
What's Streaming
WHEN THEY SEE US Stream on Netflix. Ava DuVernay's new Netflix mini-series dramatizes the case of the Central Park Five, the teenagers who were arrested in connection with the rape and assault of a white jogger, and whose case came to symbolize the stark injustices black and brown people experience within the legal system and in media coverage. "This series is talking to my pain," Korey Wise, one of the men, recently told The New York Times. "I'm enjoying it; at the same time, it hurts. But I guess when it comes down to it -- people are going to enjoy it."

Buttigieg appears to meet tougher DNC debate rules

Texto completo: It's going to be harder for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to get to the third and fourth debates, but South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg looks like he will make the stage.
The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday released the requirements for the third and fourth debates. Candidates will have to hit 2% in four qualifying pools and tally at least 130,000 individual donors in order for candidates to qualify for the debates scheduled for September and October. For the first and second rounds of debates, the DNC is requiring candidates to either hit at least 1% in three polls or receive campaign contributions from at least 65,000 donors.
A spokesperson for Buttigieg's campaign did not provide exact numbers, but said the campaign "easily" meets the individual donor threshold for the third and fourth debates.
Buttigieg is on track to meet the new, more stringent polling requirement, too. In a May 21 poll from Quinnipiac University, Buttigieg was the top pick for 5% of the 454 Democrats and Democratic-leaning people surveyed. The margin of error for the survey of Democrats and Democratic-leaning people was +/- 5.6 percentage points.
Buttigieg also had the support of 6% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters in a May 23 poll by Monmouth University. That poll has a +/- 5.4 percentage point margin of error.
However, this could certainly change. In order to make the September debate, candidates must hit 2% support in four approved polls that are released publicly between June 28 and Aug. 28. The DNC said it will announce in the future the deadlines for qualifying polls ahead of the October debate.
The approved polling includes surveys conducted by the Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio, Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY, Washington Post and Winthrop University.
The higher polling threshold could certainly narrow which of the nearly two dozen Democratic candidates make it to the third and fourth debates. Seven candidates other than Buttigieg have received 2% or more support in four national or early-state voting polls: former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
The third debate is scheduled for Sept. 12 and will be hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision.
The first debate is scheduled to be held over two nights on June 26 and 27 in Miami, and the second round is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit. The Buttigieg campaign has said it meets both the polling and donor requirements for the first two rounds of debates.
The campaigns of Buttigieg, Biden, Sanders, Harris, Warren, O'Rourke and Booker, as well as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, former Gov. Jay Inslee and Marianne Williamson, say they have met both the polling and donor qualifications to take part in the first two rounds of debates.
Klobuchar, former U.S. Rep. John Delaney, former Gov. John Hickenlooper, Gov. Steve Bullock, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell report they've met one of the thresholds to take part in the first debate.
U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton; Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam; U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet; and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have yet to meet either qualifying threshold.
The DNC is capping participation at 20 candidates for the first two round of debates and says it will announce who will make it to the stage about two weeks before each scheduled debate.

Texto completo: Jimmy's Java is everywhere in Southwest Florida.
It's in farmers markets. It's in Whole Foods. It's on tap at No. 3 Craft Brews in Cape Coral. It's even in the steak sauce at Cape's Nevermind. And now it's in a brick-and-mortar location on Fort Myers Beach.
How has the local coffee roaster, blender and cold brewer become so widespread?
"Our coffee is the best," said Jimmy's founder and owner, Jimmy "Java" Schillreff. "Our roasted coffee is the best. Our blends are the best. Our cold brew blows everyone away."
The cold brew is made with a patented process, the first patent on a coffee-making process since the Keurig cup, according to Jimmy's patent attorney. It has just coffee and water, no sweeteners, no flavorings, no milk.
"We think it's the height of arrogance to think we could figure out the right amount of sugar and milk to your taste," Jimmy said.
Recently, though, his famous cold brew has started incorporating a third ingredient — CBD, or cannabidiol, a compound found in hemp that's been credited with reducing anxiety and relieving inflammation.
"We add 20 milligrams per 8-ounce serving of pure CBD isolate," Jimmy said. "The one we found gives the significant reported benefits of CBD with little or no taste."
The Fort Myers Beach location serves the CBD cold brew along with Jimmy's traditional cold brew, plus sandwiches, eggs, sausage, bacon and locally baked muffins and cookies.
"The Jimmy's Java Joint on San Carlos Boulevard is our retail experiment," Jimmy said. "It's our little grab-and-go coffee shop concept, 350 square feet, a few tables and chairs."
His reason for choosing the beach?
"Sheer insanity," he said, laughing.
The shop opened for business last fall, right on the heels of the red-tide outbreak and its damage to the local economy, especially the beach economy. But Jimmy saw potential in the location, which is down the street from Nervous Nellie's and the forthcoming Margaritaville.
Jimmy "Java" Schillreff is no stranger to the coffee business, though he took a winding path to Southwest Florida.
"I've been in marketing and sales for 40 years," he explained.
"I've sold everything except cars. I was the chief marketing officer at a large streaming company that didn't survive the meltdown, and after that my wife and I moved to the mountains of North Carolina and opened a coffee shop. We needed something that was the opposite of tech, something that wasn't going to crash."
The pair ended up in Southwest Florida the way many people find themselves in this area — to take care of aging parents. After a while, Jimmy and his wife decided they needed a new project. So, they started roasting and selling fresh coffee at farmers markets.
"I did it as an experiment," Jimmy said. "I thought it would be an interesting way to do test marketing."
What started as an experiment has blossomed into a full-grown company with a strong local following. Jimmy's Java's coffee stands are recognizable at local markets — his employees wear matching embroidered tops — and Jimmy himself always stands out in his Panama hat and fishing shirt.
"I'm like Colonel Sanders," he said. "I always wear my uniform."
With his gift for gab and four decades of marketing experience, Jimmy knows how to sell a product. Here's his plug for his new Java Joint:
"Our cold brew served down at the Joint makes women younger and thinner and men smarter," he said.
"And we don't charge extra for that."

FCA, Renault plan merger

Texto completo: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles early Monday outlined a detailed plan to merge with French automaker Renault, which responded "with interest."
The news caps a whirlwind weekend of reports about the extent of talks between the automakers and leaves open the possibility of a wider alliance with Nissan that would reshape the global auto industry.
An FCA news release said the company had submitted a "nonbinding" proposal to Renault's board for a "transformative merger," which would be half owned by FCA and half owned by Renault. It also said no plant closures would result from the deal, asserting that benefits would come from savings on common vehicle platforms, powertrains and technologies.
A source told the Free Press on Sunday that the merger would not affect U.S. operations, including a $4.5 billion FCA expansion just approved for Detroit.
FCA's statement early Monday said: "The proposed combination would create a global automaker, preeminent in terms of revenue, volumes, profitability and technology, benefiting the companies' respective shareholders and stakeholders. The combined business would sell approximately 8.7 million vehicles annually, would be a world leader in (electric vehicle) technologies, premium brands, SUVs, pickups and light commercial vehicles and would have a broader and more balanced global presence than either company on a standalone basis."
Renault issued its own release after its board met to consider the proposal Monday, saying it would "study with interest the opportunity of such a business combination, comforting Groupe Renault's manufacturing footprint and creating additional value for the alliance."
15 million vehicles FCA, in its release, said it looks forward as part of the merger to working with Renault's partners.
"The FCA and Groupe Renault combination together with Nissan and Mitsubishi partners would be the largest global (automaker) alliance, selling more than 15 million vehicles annually," the release said, noting that the wider alliance could lead to $5.6 billion (5 billion euros) in savings.
The proposal calls for one Nissan nominee to be part of the new entity's 11-member board, highlighting the potential connections to the Renault-Nissan alliance.
The plans says shareholders in each company would receive an equivalent equity stake in the combined company, and the combination, which would be listed on the Milan, Paris and New York stock exchanges, would be handled as a merger under a Dutch parent company.
Dividend for FCA shareholders Before the deal closes, FCA said its shareholders would receive a $2.8 billion (2.5 billion euros) dividend "to mitigate the disparity in equity market values" as well as shares in Comau, an FCA robotics division, or a dividend if Comau is spun off.
The deal is likely to take more than a year to close because of its complexity.
The value of the combination is estimated at $37 billion. The release said the companies had combined 2018 revenues of $191 billion (170 billion euros) and net profit of $9 billion (8 billion euros). It also said the new entity would, in terms of sales, be No. 4 in North America, No. 2 in Europe and No. 1 in Latin America, with potential to grow its footprint in Asia. FCA currently makes the bulk of its profits in North America, specifically the United States where Renault does not have a presence.
Should the merger be approved, the two companies would join forces at a time of intense pressure and change in the global auto industry, which could hasten even more consolidation should FCA eventually fully join an alliance with Renault and its Japanese partners, Nissan and Mitsubishi. The alliance has faced recent uncertainty because of the ouster of and criminal charges against its former head, Carlos Ghosn, who maintains his innocence.
The proposed marriage, announced about two weeks before the 10-year anniversary of Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy, would join the Italian-American FCA, with its wide array of distinctive brands, including Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Maserati, and profitable North American operations, to Renault, with its connections to the Nissan alliance and noted electric vehicle strength, a plus in Europe.
FCA has its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills and is planning billions in investments in metro Detroit, including retooling its Jefferson North Assembly and turning the idled Mack Engine complex into an assembly plant for SUVs.
The UAW said it is monitoring the proposal for details.
Years of merger talk The arrangement appears to end FCA's lengthy search for a suitable match. Talks, speculation and even comments from Sergio Marchionne, the company's late CEO, had put the automaker, at various times, in contention for tie-ups with a range of automakers in Europe, North America and Asia. Previous partner or merger suggestions had included China's Geely, Germany's Volkswagen and even General Motors to name a few.
A number of analysts had offered varying assessments of FCA connecting with Renault, assuming the arrangement eventually includes Nissan, ranging from positive to disastrous.
Despite the potential upside, analysts warned that managing a combination of cultures can be most problematic for companies.
"Of course the devil's in the details, as the last 'merger of equals' involving Chrysler clearly illustrated," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, referring to the Daimler-Chrysler merger of 1998-2007.
"An FCA-Renault merger will be even more challenging to manage because it involves the U.S. and multiple European countries," he said. "Add in the eroding alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi and you've got three continents and four nations involved. It's a powerful combination in theory, but aiming for a single, aligned automotive entity, with everyone rowing in the direction, might not be realistic."
The FCA release offered a kind of rebuttal to that concern.
"FCA has a history of successfully combining (automakers) with disparate cultures to create strong leadership teams and organizations dedicated to a single purpose. Therefore, FCA's board strongly believes that this combination, which would have the scale, expertise and resources to navigate the rapidly changing automotive industry, would create new opportunities for employees of both companies and for other key stakeholders," the release said.

Texto completo: NEW CASTLE – Andrew Cuomo is marching his way out of Westchester but first he marched in the local Memorial Day parade.
The New York state governor's girlfriend, TV star Sandra Lee, is selling the New Castle house she shares with Cuomo with the couple intending to move out of the county.
But Cuomo, a Democrat, marched alongside Bill and Hillary Clinton today in the annual parade in the town that also includes the tony hamlet of Chappaqua where the former president and secretary of state live.
"We still have a lot of men and women who are serving, putting their lives in harm's way, and this is this chance for every American to respect that, community by community," Cuomo told reporters. "And that's what's nice about this parade, it's community by community."
Former President Bill Clinton said the event made him think of four high school classmates of his who died in Vietnam.
"And then thinking of all the people that I sent around the world to defend our freedom, our interests, our values," Clinton said. "It's something — this is an important holiday ... Every American needs to observe it."
Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, said it was an important tradition to honor everyone who made "the ultimate sacrifice for our country and our freedom ...
"And to do it where we live with our friends and neighbors makes it very special," she said
The parade was one of a few dozen Memorial Day observances scheduled in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam.
Also on Monday in the Bronx, during the seventh- inning stretch of a game between the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres, the Yankees honored Louis Forte, a 104-year-old World War II veteran who lives in Somers. The Yankees recognize veterans in the middle of the seventh inning and play "God Bless America."
The Clintons and Cuomo have participated in the New Castle parade and other events over the years as residents of the town.
Lee paid $1.2 million in 2008 for a six-bedroom Colonial on 3 acres at 4 Bittersweet Lane. Lee listed the house for sale earlier this month with an asking price of $2 million, with Cuomo saying his daughters moving out was the catalyst for the sale.
Both the governor and Lee denied rumors of a breakup, with Lee telling The New York Times the couple will split time between Manhattan, Albany and the Hamptons on Long Island.
The Clintons have lived locally since Bill Clinton ended his term as president in 2000. It was the couple's address as Hillary Clinton served as U.S. senator and secretary of state and twice ran for president.

A BETTER, SAFER INTERNET IT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY SMART POLICY, NOT ZUCKERBERG

Texto completo: The seemingly endless torrent of scandal that has befallen Facebook over the past several years may have finally broken founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The beleaguered executive recently endorsed internet regulation, laying out a series of proposals in a Washington Post op-ed.
But much as his recent missive on improving privacy on Facebook had to be met with raised eyebrows, these proposals, too, should face considerable skepticism.
Some of what Mr. Zuckerberg has proposed - admittedly in sweeping, vague terms - is smart and refreshing. His calls for regulations that would support "election integrity, privacy and data portability," which would allow users greater access to control their personal data online, are all sound.
But there are two significant concerns with Mr. Zuckerberg's sudden embrace of regulation.
The first involves free expression online. In his essay, Mr. Zuckerberg asserts that legislators must hold companies like his own "accountable for enforcing standards on harmful content." But, as is the case with all questions of speech regulation, who is so impartial, so clear-minded, as to set clear guidelines for what is and is not permissible speech? The answer, of course, is that no one is capable of such a feat.
Still, the mass shooting in New Zealand and the graphic video of the attack were an important reminder that serious ethical questions do exist about "harmful content" and that they cannot merely be waved away.
That's why legislators should not look to Mr. Zuckerberg on this question, but instead the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, five civil liberties organizations - the American Civil Liberties Union, the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, the Center for Democracy&Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and New America's Open Technology Institute - recently published a document emphasizing 10 key First Amendment principles that would better guide regulations than the whims of Mr. Zuckerberg.
The other concern regarding Mr. Zuckerberg's hallelujah moment is a question of motive. Why has the Facebook CEO, a man who has profited greatly off abusing the infrastructure of the internet, abruptly decided it would be better to hamstring himself and others?
No one but Mr. Zuckerberg himself may be able to answer that question, but one has to suspect that the looming specter of antitrust action, as proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may have gotten him spooked. But whatever the case, people across the country and throughout the world have ample reason to doubt Mr. Zuckerberg's sincerity.
Lawmakers can certainly take Mr. Zuckerberg's proposals into account - he does put forth several decent foundational ideas - but the people and the internet would be better served by legislation devised by independent technical experts and guided by Supreme Court case law. A better, safer internet is attainable, but it will not be devised by Mark Zuckerberg.

Texto completo: Two chairs were left empty at the Kennebunkport Memorial Day parade in honor of George H.W. and Barbara Bush, two beloved guests who died last year.
The chairs were positioned in the spot where the 41st president and the former first lady paid their respects each year.
Mark Matthews from American Legion Post 159 told the Associated Press that organizers wanted to acknowledge the absence of Bush, a long-time summer resident and a Navy veteran.
He missed last year’s parade after falling ill after attending an American Legion pancake breakfast earlier in the weekend.
Tweet
He died in November, at the age of 94, seven months after his wife.
Bush spent every summer after childhood at his family estate, Walker’s Point, apart from the time he served as a naval aviator during World War II. It then became the 'Summer White House' when he took office. And in later years, he and his wife stayed from May to October before returning to Houston for the winter.
They were well-known around the Maine town of Kennebunkport, and locals said their absence was deeply felt.
“Part of the experience of coming to town would be to go by their house or look for a Bush sighting, whether he was passing by on his boat or going to a local place to eat,” Tom Bradbury, the executive director of the Kennebunkport Conservation Trust, told the New York Times last year. “They were woven into the fabric of the town. To not have them here is a void.”

Adam Schiff encourages intelligence leaders to consider 'the example of Secretary Mattis' and resign

Texto completo: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff predicts two top officials will resist President Trump's move to declassify intelligence related to the Russia investigation.
Should pressure from Trump become too great, Schiff suggested this pair of intelligence leaders -- CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats -- follow the example of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and resign.
“If it gets to a point they are asked to do things that are unlawful or jeopardize the men and women that work within the I.C., they should speak out,” the California Democrat told the New York Times, “and, if necessary, follow the example of Secretary Mattis.”
Mattis resigned late last year in protest of Trump's plan to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.
On Thursday Trump gave Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin and instructed the heads of several agencies, including Haspel and Coats, to cooperate with the inquiry.
Schiff railed against the decision. "While Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies," he tweeted. "The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American."
Although Haspel has yet to speak out about the order, Coats offered some reassurance about the limited scope of what can be made available to the public.
"Much like we have with other investigations and reviews, the Intelligence Community will provide the Department of Justice all of the appropriate information for its review of intelligence activities related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election," Coats said in a statement Friday. "As part of that process, I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk."

Texto completo: Well, this should be easy.
All I need to do is convince Robert F. Smith to deliver next year's commencement address at Washington University in St. Louis. Smith, you see, received much-deserved attention last week when he spoke at Morehouse College's graduation and promised to pay off the student loans for the entire class.
What's another commencement and another act of generosity for a multibillionaire? Smith just handed out an estimated $40 million, but he apparently can afford it. So, as somebody who expects to have a daughter in the 2020 graduating class at WUSTL, I would like to formally invite Smith to deliver the donation, er, commencement address at next year's graduation.
OK, OK, as half-baked ideas go, this one hasn't even been taken out of the freezer. But Smith's magnanimous gesture at Morehouse should generate plenty of discussion. About philanthropy. About student loans. About our nation's priorities. And about the new gilded age in which we live.
First off, Smith's pledge is a remarkable act. Morehouse, an all-male historically black college in Atlanta, had 396 graduates this year. In one stroke, the billionaire financier altered the lives of hundreds of young adults. Imagine being handed about $30,000 dollars the day you graduate from college. Transformational? You bet it is.
Roughly 44 million Americans owe roughly $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. Think about that. We owe more for student loans than for any other debt except mortgages, and much of it is owed by young adults trying to get a grasp on the American Dream.
Research indicates that student debt is one reason young adults are delaying marriage or starting a family and one reason they have difficulty buying homes. It even makes them less likely to become entrepreneurs; when you have a monthly loan payment, you are more likely to embrace the security of working for an established corporation rather than risk the ups and downs of starting your own business.
In most cases, taking out a reasonable student loan is a wise investment in your future; many new graduates won't think twice about borrowing a similar amount for a car. And we aren't necessarily talking about the for-profit schools that coerce students into high-interest loans in exchange for training that is essentially worthless in the job market.
But it seems that America has its priorities messed up. Making it easier for students to afford college or learn a marketable trade is necessary for providing companies with the employees they will need in the future.
Washington lawmakers recognized that this year in overhauling the State Need Grant. Last year, some 68,000 students received a grant, but another 20,000 who were eligible were placed on a waiting list because of a lack of funding. Hopefully, that has been fixed. Not everybody needs to go to college to have a successful career; but everybody who wants to go and has the academic ability to do so should have the opportunity.
A little backwards
Yet while Washington is enlightened regarding the needs of students and the benefits of an educated workforce, the nation as a whole is failing its young people. The problem isn't that Robert F. Smith is willing to donate millions of dollars to young people; the problem is that there is a need for him to do so.
The United States annually spends $700 billion on the military, is adding $1 trillion to the national debt this year, and provides tax cuts for the wealthy. Meanwhile, we allow recent graduates to struggle with $1.5 trillion in loan debt. That seems a little backwards.
As The New York Times wrote editorially last week in reaction to Smith's largesse: “A new generation of plutocrats has amassed great fortunes, in part because the federal government has minimized the burden of taxation. Americans once again are reduced to applauding acts of philanthropy necessitated by failures of policy.”
The point is not to decry Smith's benevolence; the point is to create a situation in which it is not necessary. And that should be easy.

Texto completo: What's on TV
VIDA 9 p.m. on Starz. When the first season of this drama began last year, the two sisters at its center, Emma (Mishel Prada) and Lyn (Melissa Barrera), returned to the Eastside Los Angeles neighborhood they grew up in, navigating a transformed neighborhood in which they both felt like outsiders. That season ended with the pair committing to taking over the family-owned bar that had been passed to them from their mother. The second season, available in its entirety on Starz streaming platforms and airing its first episode on the network Sunday night, continues the show's interest in investigating gentrification and cultural identity. "In this season of 'Vida' I wanted to touch on the notion of being prieto, and how colorism is alive and well in the Latinx community," Tanya Saracho, the showrunner of "Vida," told The New York Times, using a gender-neutral term for Latinos. "All that is our shame, our stuff that we haven't aired out that much. And I love when we get to air it out."
GAME OF THRONES: THE LAST WATCH 9 p.m. on HBO. If catching a glimpse of the last-ever table read of scenes from the final season of "Game of Thrones" appeals, you probably don't need to know much more than that to be sold on this two-hour documentary, which goes behind the scenes during the production of the show's eighth and final season. With episodes that cost as much as $ 15 million to make, the season was a ballet of backstage coordination. Fans will appreciate seeing how it all came together -- even if many of them were let down by the fruits of that labor.
RATATOUILLE (2007) 9:15 p.m. on Freeform. The phrase "more relevant than ever" tends to be applied to aged pieces of pop culture that speak to topical political or social issues despite their age. But with the article in The Times last Wednesday about New York City's mounting rat outbreak, that label resonates here, too. This Pixar feature, which was directed by Brad Bird and won the Academy Award for best animated feature in 2007, takes as its hero a rat with epicurean tendencies, Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), who pursues a culinary career in Paris. "Displaying the usual meticulousness associated with the Pixar brand, 'Ratatouille' is a nearly flawless piece of popular art, as well as one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times.
What's Streaming
SNATCH (2001) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The English director Guy Ritchie is back in theaters this weekend with the wholesome "Aladdin," which is a far cry from this, his well-known ensemble crime comedy about seedy Londoners. Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Jason Statham are among its heavy-hitting cast. Elvis Mitchell's review for The Times referred to the movie as a "spicy comic strip without an ounce of fat."

Fiscales acusan a El Chapo de planear escape desde NYC al quejarse de las condiciones en la cárcel

Texto completo: De acuerdo con un nuevo expediente judicial, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera sólo se queja de la falta de tapones para los oídos y de la falta de actividad al aire libre como un truco para escapar de su prisión en Nueva York, dicen los fiscales.
El narcotraficante mexicano de 61 años afirmó a principios de este mes que se había visto obligado a meterse papel higiénico en los oídos para soportar el ruido de la prisión, y que no tenía nada más que una bicicleta de ejercicios para mantener su estado físico.
Sin embargo, los fiscales dicen que el caprichoso condenado nunca se molestó en pedirle a la Oficina de Prisiones tales lujos, que de todos modos se les habrían negado debido a sus medidas de seguridad extremas.
“En este caso, cualquier ejercicio al aire libre sería particularmente problemático para este acusado”, escribe el gobierno federal de Brooklyn, Brian Cogan.

Texto completo: De acuerdo con un nuevo expediente judicial, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera sólo se queja de la falta de tapones para los oídos y de la falta de actividad al aire libre como un truco para escapar de su prisión en Nueva York, dicen los fiscales.
El narcotraficante mexicano de 61 años afirmó a principios de este mes que se había visto obligado a meterse papel higiénico en los oídos para soportar el ruido de la prisión, y que no tenía nada más que una bicicleta de ejercicios para mantener su estado físico.
Sin embargo, los fiscales dicen que el caprichoso condenado nunca se molestó en pedirle a la Oficina de Prisiones tales lujos, que de todos modos se les habrían negado debido a sus medidas de seguridad extremas.
“En este caso, cualquier ejercicio al aire libre sería particularmente problemático para este acusado”, escribe el gobierno federal de Brooklyn, Brian Cogan.
“El acusado ha planeado y ejecutado con éxito escapes complejos de dos instituciones penales de alta seguridad.

Texto completo: Un asesino acaba de morir. Y eso podría preocupar al narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán , que en pocos días conocerá su sentencia.
¿Quién es este asesino?
Thomas Edward Silverstein nació hace 67 años en Long Beach, cerca de Los Ángeles, en California. De niño, le acosaban en la escuela , en parte por pensar que era judío. Su madre le defendió un día a pedradas: “Así era mi mamá”, explicó, “si alguien viene a por ti con un bate, tú agarras un bate y os ponéis a ello”.
Cuando tenía 14 años, Silverstein robó un auto y se peleó a golpes con un policía. Acabó en un reformatorio juvenil , según informa el diario The New York Times.
Salió, pero cayó en la heroína y se mantuvo a base de robos: con 19 años fue enviado a la prisión californiana de San Quintín .
Volvió a salir, volvió a robar, y volvió a prisión, en 1977, en este caso con una sentencia de 15 años. En 1980, esa condena se convirtió en cadena perpetua tras asesinar a otro preso que se había negado a traficar con heroína.
Cinco años después, esa sentencia fue anulada, al considerarse que el informante que le delató había mentido. Pero para entonces Silverstein, que se había unido en la cárcel a una pandilla que defiende la superioridad de la raza blanca , ya había asesinado a otros dos presos, miembros de una pandilla afroamericana.
Pese a estar en régimen de aislamiento, Silverstein se las arregló para liberarse de sus esposas cuando un guarda le trasladaba a las duchas, y lo asesinó. Entre otros motivos, alegó que el guarda había destruido las pinturas del preso , que se había aficionado al arte en la cárcel, aunque los oficiales lo negaron.
Silverstein fue trasladado de nuevo a otra prisión, también en régimen de aislamiento y sin contacto alguno con otros seres humanos .
El asesinato del guarda (otro más murió el mismo día a manos de un cómplice de Silverstein) llevó además a diseñar una nueva cárcel de máxima seguridad donde nada parecido pudiera ocurrir.
Así se creó la prisión de máxima seguridad de Florence, en Colorado , inaugurada en 1994 y que alberga ahora, entre otros, a Ramzi Yousef , responsable del atentado de 1993 contra el World Trade Center de New York; al terrorista del maratón de Boston, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ; a Ted Kaczynski , apodado Unabomber; o al terrorista del zapato, Richard Reid , quien intentó hacer estallar en un avión una bomba que escondía en su calzado.
Y allí acabó Silverstein en 2005, encerrado 23 horas al día en un celda de 80 pies cuadrados, con una sola de hora de ejercicio al día en una sala contigua. Su único vínculo con el mundo fuera de la celda: una televisión en blanco y negro.
“No sé qué otra cosa podríamos haber hecho para evitar más violencia por parte de un hombre que no tiene nada que perder ”, ha explicado Norman Carlson, director del Departamento de Prisiones, para justificar el aislamiento de todo contacto humano, toda vez que entonces no había pena de muerte a nivel federal.
“Toc, toc, toc”, escribió Silverstein sobre su aislamiento en prisión, “los minutos, las horas, los días, las semanas, los meses, los años pasan constantemente, sin fin o remedio a la vista”.
“No entré aquí como un asesino, pero aquí aprendes a odiar ”, explicó sobre la cárcel, culpando a los guardas de “ alimentar a la bestia que aguarda dentro de todos nosotros”.
Silverstein llevaba en régimen de aislamiento de forma ininterrumpida desde 1987. Antes ya lo estaba, pero ese año fue liberado durante una semana durante un motín de presos cubanos en Atlanta (Georgia).
Cuando fue encerrado de nuevo, ya no volvió a dejar el aislamiento hasta ser hospitalizado y morir poco después, el 11 de mayo, en Lakewood (Colorado).
Tenía 67 años. Había pasado los últimos 36 en una celda de aislamiento , el mayor tiempo conocido para un preso en Estados Unidos.
“Nuestro Gobierno entierra a entierra a gente viva en tumbas de cemento por toda su vida”, se lamentó Silverstein, “en realidad es más humano ejecutar a alguien que torturarlo año tras año tras año”.
Pero una corte de apelaciones aseguró que su encierro estaba justificado dada su “conducta violenta” y su liderazgo en la pandilla extremista.
La cárcel de máxima seguridad de Colorado y su régimen de aislamiento esperan ahora a El Chapo , que podría ser condenado el 25 de junio a pasar allí el resto de su vida. Tiene 62 años.
Guzmán tampoco puede ser condenado a muerte. Pero sí a muerte en vida.

$500 a la semana cobraba policía de Nueva York por ignorar red de prostitución

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ellos tres ya se han declararon culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Las autoridades han dicho que Paz se aprovechó de la experiencia y sus contactos profesionales, pues fue detective de NYPD por dos décadas, hasta retirarse en 2010.
¿Cómo fue atrapado? El año pasado la Oficina de Asuntos Internos del Departamento de Policía recibió una denuncia anónima sobre la operación.
En septiembre, la policía arrestó a 50 personas en relación con los burdeles, incluyendo a Paz, tres sargentos, dos detectives y dos oficiales de NYPD.
Otros dos oficiales fueron despojados de sus armas y distintivos y puestos en servicio administrativo. Peralta también fue arrestada y se declaró culpable de ayudar a su esposo a dirigir los burdeles. La pareja tiene dos hijos.
¿Cómo evadieron a la policía durante tantos años? A Paz le avisaban desde NYPD sobre futuras redadas y agentes encubiertos, lo que le permitía reubicar sus operaciones con prontitud.
Además, siendo ex policía, conocía muy bien los detalles sobre los procedimiento en investigaciones de ese tenor. Por ejemplo, sabía que a los agentes encubiertos no se les permite desnudarse en presencia de una prostituta. Entonces, cada vez que uno llegaba a los burdeles, se les exigía que se desvistiera.
Samaniego era detective en Brooklyn South y se declaró culpable de dos cargos de corrupción el 8 de mayo. Ese mismo día, fue despedido del Departamento de Policía.
Las autoridades dijeron que Samaniego ganaba $500 dólares a la semana a cambio de proporcionar información que ayudó a Paz a evadir a la policía, incluyendo descripciones sobre los investigadores encubiertos, su aspecto y vestuario.
Samaniego fue acusado de pasar esta información mientras estaba de servicio, a veces asignado a un equipo de policía que iba a investigar los burdeles.
Paz se unió a NYPD en 1990. Para 2006 estaba divorciado de su primera esposa y vivía con Peralta en una casa unifamiliar en Ozone Park, Queens.
En 2008, tenía préstamos hipotecarios de alto riesgo y debía $690 mil dólares, con un ingreso anual de $120 mil dólares en salario y horas extra. Por ello se declaró en bancarrota. Ese mismo año comenzó su empresa criminal, y en 2010 se retiró de NYPD.

Texto completo: Un asesino acaba de morir. Y eso podría preocupar al narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán , que en pocos días conocerá su sentencia.
¿Quién es este asesino?
Thomas Edward Silverstein nació hace 67 años en Long Beach, cerca de Los Ángeles, en California. De niño, le acosaban en la escuela , en parte por pensar que era judío. Su madre le defendió un día a pedradas: “Así era mi mamá”, explicó, “si alguien viene a por ti con un bate, tú agarras un bate y os ponéis a ello”.
Cuando tenía 14 años, Silverstein robó un auto y se peleó a golpes con un policía. Acabó en un reformatorio juvenil , según informa el diario The New York Times.
Salió, pero cayó en la heroína y se mantuvo a base de robos: con 19 años fue enviado a la prisión californiana de San Quintín .
Volvió a salir, volvió a robar, y volvió a prisión, en 1977, en este caso con una sentencia de 15 años. En 1980, esa condena se convirtió en cadena perpetua tras asesinar a otro preso que se había negado a traficar con heroína.
Cinco años después, esa sentencia fue anulada, al considerarse que el informante que le delató había mentido. Pero para entonces Silverstein, que se había unido en la cárcel a una pandilla que defiende la superioridad de la raza blanca , ya había asesinado a otros dos presos, miembros de una pandilla afroamericana.
Pese a estar en régimen de aislamiento, Silverstein se las arregló para liberarse de sus esposas cuando un guarda le trasladaba a las duchas, y lo asesinó. Entre otros motivos, alegó que el guarda había destruido las pinturas del preso , que se había aficionado al arte en la cárcel, aunque los oficiales lo negaron.
Silverstein fue trasladado de nuevo a otra prisión, también en régimen de aislamiento y sin contacto alguno con otros seres humanos .
El asesinato del guarda (otro más murió el mismo día a manos de un cómplice de Silverstein) llevó además a diseñar una nueva cárcel de máxima seguridad donde nada parecido pudiera ocurrir.
Así se creó la prisión de máxima seguridad de Florence, en Colorado , inaugurada en 1994 y que alberga ahora, entre otros, a Ramzi Yousef , responsable del atentado de 1993 contra el World Trade Center de New York; al terrorista del maratón de Boston, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ; a Ted Kaczynski , apodado Unabomber; o al terrorista del zapato, Richard Reid , quien intentó hacer estallar en un avión una bomba que escondía en su calzado.
Y allí acabó Silverstein en 2005, encerrado 23 horas al día en un celda de 80 pies cuadrados, con una sola de hora de ejercicio al día en una sala contigua. Su único vínculo con el mundo fuera de la celda: una televisión en blanco y negro.
“No sé qué otra cosa podríamos haber hecho para evitar más violencia por parte de un hombre que no tiene nada que perder ”, ha explicado Norman Carlson, director del Departamento de Prisiones, para justificar el aislamiento de todo contacto humano, toda vez que entonces no había pena de muerte a nivel federal.
“Toc, toc, toc”, escribió Silverstein sobre su aislamiento en prisión, “los minutos, las horas, los días, las semanas, los meses, los años pasan constantemente, sin fin o remedio a la vista”.
“No entré aquí como un asesino, pero aquí aprendes a odiar ”, explicó sobre la cárcel, culpando a los guardas de “ alimentar a la bestia que aguarda dentro de todos nosotros”.
Silverstein llevaba en régimen de aislamiento de forma ininterrumpida desde 1987. Antes ya lo estaba, pero ese año fue liberado durante una semana durante un motín de presos cubanos en Atlanta (Georgia).
Cuando fue encerrado de nuevo, ya no volvió a dejar el aislamiento hasta ser hospitalizado y morir poco después, el 11 de mayo, en Lakewood (Colorado).
Tenía 67 años. Había pasado los últimos 36 en una celda de aislamiento , el mayor tiempo conocido para un preso en Estados Unidos.
“Nuestro Gobierno entierra a entierra a gente viva en tumbas de cemento por toda su vida”, se lamentó Silverstein, “en realidad es más humano ejecutar a alguien que torturarlo año tras año tras año”.
Pero una corte de apelaciones aseguró que su encierro estaba justificado dada su “conducta violenta” y su liderazgo en la pandilla extremista.
La cárcel de máxima seguridad de Colorado y su régimen de aislamiento esperan ahora a El Chapo , que podría ser condenado el 25 de junio a pasar allí el resto de su vida. Tiene 62 años.
Guzmán tampoco puede ser condenado a muerte. Pero sí a muerte en vida.

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ellos tres ya se han declararon culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Las autoridades han dicho que Paz se aprovechó de la experiencia y sus contactos profesionales, pues fue detective de NYPD por dos décadas, hasta retirarse en 2010.
¿Cómo fue atrapado? El año pasado la Oficina de Asuntos Internos del Departamento de Policía recibió una denuncia anónima sobre la operación.
En septiembre, la policía arrestó a 50 personas en relación con los burdeles, incluyendo a Paz, tres sargentos, dos detectives y dos oficiales de NYPD.
Otros dos oficiales fueron despojados de sus armas y distintivos y puestos en servicio administrativo. Peralta también fue arrestada y se declaró culpable de ayudar a su esposo a dirigir los burdeles. La pareja tiene dos hijos.
¿Cómo evadieron a la policía durante tantos años? A Paz le avisaban desde NYPD sobre futuras redadas y agentes encubiertos, lo que le permitía reubicar sus operaciones con prontitud.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS - The Harry Potter Film Concert Series returns to Ohio Theatre with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in Concert, the fourth film in the Harry Potter series. On Jan. 18, 2020 the Columbus Symphony will perform the magical score live from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire while the entire film plays in high-definition on a 40-foot screen.
CAPA presents Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in Concert at the Ohio Theatre (39 E. State St.) on Saturday, Jan. 18, 2020 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $50-$125 and can be purchased in person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at 614-469-0939 or 800-982-2787.
In 2016, CineConcerts and Warner Bros. Consumer Products announced the Harry Potter Film Concert Series, a global concert tour celebrating the Harry Potter films. Since the world premiere of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Concert in June 2016, more than 1.3 million fans have enjoyed this magical experience from J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, which is scheduled to include more than 900 performances across more than 48 countries worldwide through 2019.
In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament, a grueling contest among three wizarding schools in which he confronts a dragon, water demons, and an enchanted maze only to find himself in Lord Voldemort's grasp. All will change when Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave childhood forever and face challenges beyond their imagining.
Winning both the International Film Music Critics Award (IFMCA) and ASCAP Film and Television Music Award for the score, the rich tapestry of music composed by Patrick Doyle (Brave, Hamlet, Sense and Sensibility) brought fresh emotional gravitas with darker melodic undercurrents as Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione face these new adventures.
Justin Freer, president of CineConcerts and producer/conductor of the Harry Potter Film Concert Series explains, "The Harry Potter film series is a once-in-a-lifetime cultural phenomenon that continues to delight millions of fans around the world. It is with great pleasure that we bring fans for the first time ever an opportunity to experience the award-winning music scores played live by a symphony orchestra, all while the beloved film is simultaneously projected onto the big screen. This is truly an unforgettable event."
Brady Beaubien of CineConcerts and concert producer for the Harry Potter Film Concert Series added, "Harry Potter is synonymous with excitement around the world and we hope that by performing this incredible music with the full movie, audiences will enjoy returning to the Wizarding World."
Tickets are on sale now.

Jim James' Uniform Distortion Tour stops at the Southern COLUMBUS - Jim James has spent the better part of almost two decades as the lead singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist of My Morning Jacket. With an illustrious solo career of his own, James' Uniform Distortion tour will celebrate his 2018 record of the same name and include other career-spanning material.
CAPA presents Jim James at the Southern Theatre (21 E. Main St.) on Friday, June 14, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $41.50-$51 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at 614-469-0939 or 800-982-2787.
With seven studio albums, My Morning Jacket has grown into one of the most acclaimed rock and roll bands in the world. The New York Times heralded the band as, "...the new kings of expand-your-mind, religious-experience rock..." Their last three albums—Evil Urges (2018), Circuital (2011), and The Waterfall (2015)—each received Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Album with The Waterfall debuting at number 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. Alongside the band's recording and touring, James has maintained a steady, bordering on voracious, flow of work.
In 2013, James released his debut solo record, Regions of Light and Sound of God. He wrote, produced, and played all instruments himself (except for strings and some percussion) for the record which was inspired by life and the 1929 novel (written in woodcuts) God's Man by Lynd Ward. It was named one of the best albums of the year by PASTE, MTV, and FUSE and was "the year's first great record" (GQ). A performance of track "A New Life" on "Late Night" earned high praise from the now-"Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon,"...to this day, my favorite musical performance was 'A New Life' on 'Late Night' ...He [Jim James] is fantastic. I love him."
In 2016, James released the politically charged solo record, Eternally Even. Rolling Stone described it as, "nine flamboyantly spiritual songs wrapped in creamy electronics and set to funk and hip hop beats...an eccentric, gently compelling pleasure. [Jim James] renders his change gospel with conversational grace, Bill Withers warmth, Sly Stone optimism and Neil Young conviction." The album's release saw him embark on a national tour with appearances on "The Tonight Show," "The Late, Late Show with James Corden," and a debut at #1 on the Billboard Alternative chart. The album topped many year-end best lists with NPR praising the record's "arresting, soulful ... transcendent tunes."
James released his third solo album, Uniform Distortion (2019) was received with immediate acclaim. "A giddily powerful response to these troubled times," hailed the Guardian in its four-star review. "His mix of musical joie de vivre and lyrical home truths prove fiendishly effective." The Washington Post said, "With driving guitar riffs and catchy hooks combined with his signature soaring vocals, James delivers an utterly engaging, hard-charging, straight-ahead record that almost feels like a throwback to a different era while also being very much current." American Songwriter claimed, ""There are enough artistic twists and turns to please even the most dedicated Jacket fan, showing that James remains as musically edgy as ever on an album that pulses with energy, enthusiasm, and the restless spirit James has always personified." Four months after Uniform Distortion was released, James followed with the companion record of Uniform Clarity comprising acoustic renditions of the songs in a more stripped down and honest response to what went before.
James has continued expanding on his zealous lists of credits, lending his voice to albums by the likes of the Roots, David Lynch, Brandi Carlile, and John Fogerty, and partnering with other artists on numerous side projects such as New Multitudes, Monsters of Folk, and T-Bone Burnett's The New Basement Tapes.
Known for his live performances, James has found himself in the touring company of those like Neil Young, Pearl Jam, and Bob Dylan, even appearing in the Dylan-inspired film, I'm Not There. My Morning Jacket supported Roger Waters as his surprise backing band during the famed 2015 Newport Folk Festival. He has embedded himself in the world of film and television, be it through the use of his music in various projects or his long-running relationships with those in the field. He has also established himself as a producer in his own right, producing records by Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dean Wareham, Basia Bulat, Amo Amo, and Ray Lamontagne. In 2016, he collaborated with NASA for the launch of their Juno Mission and the Sundance Film Festival for their Freedom of Expression event.
In 2018, James embarked on a successful, intimate, career-spanning solo acoustic tour, which saw him play sold out dates through historic theatres and performing arts centers across the US. In the 2019 Uniform Distortion tour, James will play the complete record with a full band for the first time nationally.

Sini's report details a litany of injustices

Texto completo: After 44 years, Keith Bush's 1976 murder conviction was vacated by a judge after a district attorney's report concluded he had been wrongfully convicted of the sex-related murder of teenager Sherese Watson.
A report filed with the court Wednesday by the Suffolk District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Bureau detailed how several former Suffolk authorities kept secret evidence of another potential murder suspect who may be the real killer.
The newly discovered evidence shows that "Bush is actually innocent of the crimes with which he was convicted," concluded Howard Master, who heads the bureau for Suffolk District Attorney Timothy Sini. Bush, now 62, spent 33 years behind bars and had since been paroled as a sex-offender.
The nearly 100-page report said Bush was wrongfully convicted during a 1976 trial because of several dubious pieces of evidence, including faulty forensic evidence, witnesses who felt intimidated by police and a false signed confession that Bush says he had beaten out of him by homicide detectives.
Police denied any wrongdoing at the time but the report said one of the former detectives, when questioned recently by Master's investigators, "alluded to use of coercive tactics" in putting together Bush's signed confession. Before his January 1975 murder arrest, Bush, then 17, had no criminal history.
Perhaps most significantly in throwing out the conviction, the report said then-Suffolk authorities violated legal rules by failing to disclose the existence of "alternative suspect" John W. Jones Jr. - who admitted in 1975 to tripping over Watson's body at the murder scene and leaving behind a plastic comb that he identified as his own. Although Jones was twice given a lie-detector test, Suffolk never mentioned anything about Jones at Bush's trial, as required by legal precedent.
"The alternative suspect [Jones] may well have committed the offenses of which Bush was wrongfully convicted," said the report, which points out Jones' history of violent and sex-related offenses both before and after Watson's 1975 murder. The report labeled Jones, who died in 2006, as "perhaps the most viable suspect in Watson's murder."
The report painted a disturbing picture about how Suffolk authorities, particularly trial prosecutor Gerard Sullivan along with then-Suffolk homicide detectives, hid vital information in the Bush case.
The evidence about Jones "was suppressed prior to trial and was highly material to Bush's defense because it could have helped Bush establish that someone else had committed the murder, " the report concluded.
Recently, Conviction Integrity Bureau investigators questioned two former homicide former detectives, Dennis Rafferty and August Stahl, who interrogated Bush in January 1975 and put together his signed confession. Through his attorney, Rafferty answered only a limited number of questions posed to him and denied any wrongdoing. But the report said that Stahl, now 90, displayed a "racial animus" and raised former Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota's name in the matter.
"Why is this thing being opened up again, I thought Tommy Spota took care of this?" Stahl told the investigators, according to the court papers filed Wednesday.
Spota was a longtime Suffolk district attorney and a former law partner of Sullivan, the prosecutor in the 1976 Bush trial. Spota currently faces federal corruption charges and is expected to go on trial later this year. Spota told Newsday in a story published Monday that he doesn't remember the Bush case.
In addition, when questioned recently by investigators, Stahl used a racial epithet when first asked about Bush and said he believed he was guilty.
The report said that Stahl currently resides in a small enclave in Yaphank owned by the German American Settlement League and that he is a former GASL board member. In 2015, The New York Times identified Stahl's league as an offshoot of 1930s pro-Nazi sympathizers group who built bungalows there as part of a pro-Nazi summer camp. The DA's report notes that the bylaws of this community required homeowners to be primarily of "German extraction" until a 2016 settlement of a federal discrimination lawsuit and a follow-up settlement with the state attorney general.
When called for comment, Stahl denied any bias and said he had not talked with Spota about the case. He said his comment to investigators was a general reaction to the ongoing efforts by Bush to prove his innocence.
The report confirmed evidence developed over the past decade by Bush's defense lawyer, Adele Bernhard, a professor at New York Law School. She argued that male DNA evidence taken from Watson's body didn't match Bush's and that a recanting witness, Maxine Bell, and other witnesses for Bush should be believed.
The report also found fault with 1976 trial prosecution testimony that claimed a metal comb discovered at Bush's home was used him in the attack on Watson, who died from strangulation. Wounds on the dead girl's body showed that it didn't match the spacing on the comb's tines. The report also said that testimony offered about fibers found at the murder scene is considered unreliable by today's forensic standards.

After Exposé, Head of 787 Factory Is Out

Texto completo: The executive in charge of Boeing's troubled 787 Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, S.C., is leaving the company, according to an internal company memo reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday.
The departure of the executive, David Carbon, the vice president for 787 operations at Boeing South Carolina since 2016, comes about a month after The Times published an article detailing shoddy production practices and weak oversight at the factory.
No full-time successor to Mr. Carbon, who plans to return to his native Australia, was announced. The Boeing memo, written by Brad Zaback, the head of the company's 787 program, said Mr. Carbon was leaving "to care for his family."
The Times's article detailed a decade of problems at the South Carolina plant that continue to plague the factory. Debris was often left on finished jets, planes were badly damaged during the manufacturing process, and employees who tried to register complaints were frequently sidelined.
Current and former employees described finding a stray bolt left in an engine, and a ladder and strings of lights left in the tails of planes that went up for test flights. Sharp metal shavings were regularly found under floor panels, near the wiring that controls the planes.
In the memo, Mr. Zaback said Boeing's South Carolina "787 manufacturing operations are the healthiest they've ever been."
The upheaval at the North Charleston plant coincides with broader scrutiny of Boeing's culture after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max jet. The Max remains grounded, and the company is working with regulators to return it to service. Lawmakers and regulators are examining whether a rush to produce and certify the Max contributed to the flawed design of an anti-stall system that is believed to have played a role in both crashes.
As head of the South Carolina plant, Mr. Carbon was responsible for a culture that current and former employees said was overly focused on producing aircraft quickly, and was insufficiently concerned with safety.
An inspector for American Airlines who inspected 787s produced at the factory was so frustrated with the sloppy conditions there that he would collect debris left on planes in zip-lock bags and present them to Mr. Carbon.
In recent months, Boeing has increased the production rate for 787s to 14 a month from 12. During the same period, it has reduced the number of quality inspectors at the plant.
"David has worked tirelessly the past three years to improve our production system and help us achieve the highest wide-body production rate in history," Mr. Zaback said of Mr. Carbon.
In response to The Times's article, the Federal Aviation Administration circulated an internal memo from the agency's head of aircraft certification that confirmed many of the newspaper's findings. The memo revealed that since September, the regulator had investigated and confirmed three safety complaints made by factory employees. The F.A.A. is also looking into a claim that as recently as late March, a worker at the plant was pressured to sign off on work related to a jet's airworthiness.
The aviation administration has subjected the North Charleston plant to exceptional scrutiny in the past, forcing Boeing employees to take extra steps to demonstrate that they were meeting government standards. From June 2013 to October 2014, the F.A.A. reined in the ability of Boeing employees in North Charleston to act as its representatives when certifying aircraft, a common industry practice.
The F.A.A. memo said that the agency was continuing to take unusual steps to ensure the quality of work at the plant, including visiting "every other week" to see that tools were not being lost, a recurring problem. The agency is also requiring that one of its representatives sign off on the installation of every floor panel in 787s built in North Charleston, an exceptional level of oversight.
Darrel Larson, a director of operations at the North Charleston factory, will be in charge of the plant until Mr. Carbon's full-time successor is named, Boeing said.

Doug Robinson: 4 All-Stars minus 1 All-Star does not always equal a loss

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — In the strange math of team sports, four All-Stars minus one All-Star does not always equal a loss, and that’s what makes the Golden State Warriors’ tear through the NBA playoffs so intriguing.
Is less sometimes more?
When Kevin Durant — the two-time NBA Finals MVP — went down with a calf injury in the second round, it was met with dire predictions. This was like U2 without Bono, or so the thinking went. The New York Times' response: “With Durant Hurt, Warriors Dynasty Could Suddenly Be Reeling.” Reuters: “Warriors Title Defense Gets Tricky After Durant Injury.” Undefeated.com: “Are the Warriors in trouble?”
Not exactly. They’re unbeaten since Durant left the court 5½ games ago, finishing off the Rockets in six games then sweeping the Trail Blazers. They’re headed to the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive year.
Taken at face value, it makes no sense. Before Durant was injured on May 8, he was the league’s best postseason player, averaging 34.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. He was responsible for about one-third of the team’s points. And yet with Durant out — replaced by a no-name combination of bench players — the Warriors have continued to win.
Along the way, they have produced such a dazzling display of ball movement and shooting that some afficionados of the game dare to wonder: Are the Warriors actually better without Durant? Is it possible that reliance on the likes of Durant stifles the free-flow game that was the hallmark of the pre-Durant Warriors?
OK, it’s a small sample size, but consider this: Since Durant joined the team in 2016, the Warriors are 34-4 in games in which Stephen Curry played and Durant did not — a pace that would break the team’s NBA record for victories in a single season (73). Per CBS Sports, when Durant has played without Curry, the Warriors are 28-18 — a 49-win pace.
This is not a new phenomenon. Packing a roster with all-stars doesn’t always add up to good chemistry on the court. In 2003, the Lakers added Karl Malone and Gary Payton to a roster that included Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. They were routed in the NBA Finals by the Pistons. In 2013, the Lakers paired up Steve Nash and Dwight Howard with Bryant and Pau Gasol and lost in the first round of the playoffs.
On the other hand, the so-called Super Teams have dominated the league in recent years. These are teams that were able to stockpile all-stars because the NBA doesn’t have a hard cap a la the NFL, most of them via some back-room maneuvering by LeBron James. It’s no guarantee of a championship (which is why James is only 3-6 in championship games), but 10 of the last 16 slots in the NBA Finals have been filled by Super Teams, and they’ve won five of the last eight championships.
Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs grew their team organically and won five championships the last 20 years with chemistry. Football’s New England Patriots have built a dynasty with a hodgepodge of unsung role players.
It’s largely been forgotten that the Warriors built a pretty good team through development and the draft before Durant fell into their laps. They had appeared in two straight NBA Finals and won one of them; they also won an NBA regular-season record 73 games the year before Durant arrived. Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, along with a cast of very good role players, created one of the best teams in NBA history.
Then Durant signed with the team and the Warriors, now designated a Super Team, won two more championships.
With Durant injured, the Warriors returned to their old form, launching a debate about what it all means. CBS Sports' headline: “Durant is Merely a Luxury.” The Mercury News: “No, the Warriors are not Better Without Durant, You Just Want Them to Be.” This could be an ongoing discussion next season if Durant, who enters free agency in the off-season, signs elsewhere.
In November, Green and Durant got into a shouting match at the end of a game. According to several reports, Green shouted to Durant, “We don’t need you! We won without you! Leave.”
So far, Green has been right.

Texto completo: Few things offend Bernie Sanders as much as people escaping from command-and-control government systems, even minority students whose parents are desperate to get their kids a decent education.
The socialist wants to turn George Wallace on his head and not block black children from attending traditional public schools, but block them from exiting those schools for something better.
The New York Times wrote a long, devastating report the other day on the then-Burlington, Vermont, mayor's love affair with the Sandinistas in the 1980s. So many decades later, his reflex is the same: If the Sandinistas wouldn't favor it, he's not inclined to like it much either. That goes for charter schools that, yes, are publicly funded, but still too flexible and unregulated for refined socialist tastes.
Over the weekend, Sanders unveiled his education plan. He wants to end for-profit charter schools (about 15 percent of all charters) and impose a moratorium on new public funding of charters, while taking steps to impose a one-size-fits-all regulatory regime on existing charters.
Sanders thus seeks to kneecap what has been an astonishingly successful experiment in urban education because it doesn't fit nicely within his ideological preconceptions.
That Sanders says he wants to do this to advance the principle that "every human being has the fundamental right to a good education" is hilariously perverse. The comrades will have a good chuckle over that one.
Charter schools aren't the product of a libertarian conspiracy. They fall short of the vouchers favored by conservatives to allow parents to get access to private schools. Charters receive public money, but have more leeway to develop policies outside the regulatory and union straitjacket of traditional public schools.
Charters had bipartisan support before a Vermont socialist became one of the party's thought leaders. Bill Clinton won the first-ever lifetime achievement award from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Promoting charters was a hallmark of Barack Obama's education agenda, and a signature of Cory Booker's mayoralty in Newark, New Jersey.
Not all charters are created equal. Some don't serve their students well, especially online charter schools, and the performance of suburban and rural charter schools hasn't been very impressive. It's the charter schools in urban areas with the worst traditional public schools that have excelled.
According to a well-regarded 2015 study by Stanford's Center for Research on Education Outcomes, students in urban charter schools got the equivalent of 40 additional days of math instruction and 28 additional days of reading annually. The numbers for African American students in poverty were even better. Charters in Newark and Boston have seen enormous academic gains.
In New York City, the Success Academy founded by Eva Moskowitz -- one of the foremost education reformers of our time -- has eliminated racial and economic achievement gaps.
It's amazing what schools can do when they impose discipline, have the highest expectations and focus with a laser intensity on instruction.
Anyone interested in the education of minority students should seek to build on these oases of excellence, rather than cut them off. But the teachers unions hate charters, and they are a much more powerful potential cadre in the Sanders "revolution" than poor black kids.
Sanders suggests that charter schools somehow increase segregation. This is nonsense, as Jonathan Chait of New York magazine points out. Urban charter schools reflect the segregation of their neighborhoods where they are located -- just like traditional public schools do.
The polling shows that minority parents get what Sanders (and white progressives) refuses to understand. A solid majority of black and Hispanic Democrats have a favorable view of charters, while white Democrats have an unfavorable view by a 2-1 margin.
It is doubtful how much of his anti-charter agenda Sanders would be able to enact if elected, since much of the action is at the state and local level. That he's hostile to these schools should, regardless, redound to his shame.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is set to name Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general, to a top position at the Department of Homeland Security, bringing aboard a conservative who has been one of the nation’s most outspoken voices on illegal immigration.
Cuccinelli’s appointment was confirmed by a White House official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an appointment that had not yet been publicly announced. The news was first reported Tuesday by the New York Times.
The Trump administration has been shaking up leadership at the Department of Homeland Security for weeks and the president has said he wants the department, which oversees the border as well as immigration enforcement in the rest of the country, to implement his policies more aggressively.
In explaining some of the changes at Homeland Security, Trump said last month he wanted the department to go in a “tougher direction. ”
Tougher direction: What does Trump's 'tougher' immigration plan look like?
Cuccinelli revolt: 'Stop Trump' delegates lose floor fight but expose GOP divide
The White House official pushed back on reports that Cuccinelli would serve as the immigration “czar,” a position Trump considered creating this year to coordinate the administration’s response to the flow of migrants arriving from Central America. Cuccinelli will be named to a DHS post, the official said, but not as immigration czar.
Cuccinelli was Virginia’s attorney general from 2010 to 2014 and ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2013.
Cuccinelli not only opposed Trump's nomination in 2016, he was part of a futile effort at the party's convention that year to allow delegates to cast their votes for someone else. After the effort failed, Cuccinelli threw his credentials on the floor and walked out, claiming party leaders rammed through the voice vote in favor of the convention rules.
He sided with Arizona in a 2012 lawsuit in which the Obama administration sued the state over a law intended to increase the power of police to enforce federal immigration laws. Years earlier, Cuccinelli drafted a legal opinion finding that police in Virginia could inquire about the immigration status of people that they stopped.
The decision came as welcome news to supporters of the president’s immigration strategy of cracking down on illegal immigration and limiting legal immigration.
Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said it remains unclear what Cuccinelli’s role will be, and where he will rank in the ever-changing chain of command that features acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.
But Mehlman said he believes Cuccinelli has proven his immigration bona fides during his time as Virginia’s attorney general and possesses, “from our perspective, the proper outlook on the issue. "
"It's hard to prejudge how this will all work," Mehlman said. "But as far as understanding the issue and being on board with the general agenda of the administration, he certainly checks all the boxes. "
That adherence to Trump’s hardline immigration stance is disappointing, but not surprising, to the president’s critics.
Douglas Rivlin of America’s Voice, an immigration advocacy group, said it was clear Trump was going to pick Cuccinelli, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach or any another "failed Republican gubernatorial candidate" in his quest to force the Department of Homeland Security to crack down even more on undocumented immigrants and asylum-seeking Central Americans.
"By selecting Cuccinelli, Trump is offering a preview of what’s to come from a Trump White House and Trump re-election campaign that is obsessed, failing, and flailing on immigration politics and policy," Rivlin said.

Texto completo: So how will Mayor Bill de Blasio's presidential run affect the fate of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo over the "chokehold" death of Eric Garner? It may not help Pantaleo.
How's it going to look for a so-called progressive candidate if the mayor's normally pliant police commissioner somehow allows the NYPD's most vilified officer to "vest out" so he can at least receive a portion of his pension? Not good for candidate Bill. Which means the worst for Pantaleo.
Indeed, the city's body politic seems to have been galvanized by the idea that Pantaleo, rightly or wrongly, must be fired. A New York Times opinion writer weighed in with a column, which was misleading from the first paragraph to nearly the last. "As Eric Garner lay dying," Mara Gay wrote, "he was gasping for air and bleeding in his neck and eyes. The arm of a New York police officer was pressed hard against his throat."
According to testimony from none other than Ramsey Orta, the man who captured the "I can't breathe" video, Pantaleo's arm was not around Garner's throat when Garner was gasping for air and said he couldn't breathe.
When an outcome turns bad, the NYPD makes it up as it goes along, circling the wagons and setting up the most vulnerable officer. Two supervisors on the scene also played key roles in Garner's death. You haven't heard much from the NYPD about them, though.
Garner was a 390-pound man with asthma, a heart condition, and 29 priors, mostly for selling loose cigarettes. He was a chronic nuisance to police in Staten Island. Twenty-nine arrests obviously did no good. So what about taking a different approach? What about consulting with him, his family or his minister? Isn't that what de Blasio's neighborhood policing is supposed to be about?
Anyone with half a brain gets that black Americans have historically gotten the short end at every turn from virtually every governmental agency. This is especially true of the police.
In Garner's case, we must remember, there were two sergeants on the scene. Neither made any mention of the supposed chokehold. It took Orta's cellphone video to bring it to light.
If the NYPD wants to get real about accountability, it needs to hold public hearings about this. Otherwise, how can people conclude anything other than Garner's death was "not a big deal" as a Staten Island lieutenant texted before learning the full dimension of the case.

Glanville shows caution on allegedly racist signal

Texto completo: Doug Glanville, Cubs TV analyst and reporter for NBC Sports Chicago, weighed in with a nuanced response regarding the man who made what some considered a racist gesture behind Glanville during a May 7 telecast at Wrigley Field.
Choosing the pages of the New York Times to make his stand with a bylined essay last weekend, Glanville did not pass judgment on whether the spectator's upside-down "OK" hand signal was racist.
Instead, the former Cubs outfielder deftly threaded a needle by acknowledging the gesture has enough benign uses (such as the so-called circle game) to leave room for interpretation and warning it's important not to get bogged down in such debates.
"Ambiguity has always been a friend to racism," Glanville wrote.
The Cubs had no such qualms about deeming the man's gesture ill-intended, completing their investigation into the incident in less than 24 hours, then immediately announcing he had been banned indefinitely from Wrigley Field and other team properties.
The team neither identified the man nor said what it found to support its finding. No one has come forward either to take credit for the gesture or sue the ballclub for being unfairly punished.
Glanville said even if the racist message was unintended, it doesn't mean such a message wasn't received because racism is a fact of everyday life, with or without hand signals.
"Symbols," he said, "are the easy part of racism to endure. Racism is not just a symbol or a feeling; it also is a system. It is institutional power that can crush neighborhoods, generations of children, stripping people of validation, self-worth and opportunity. Those who have been subjected to this misuse of power are never certain that they will be OK."
Glanville concluded with a call for unity and action, saying it's vital for everyone to acknowledge racism, which can be found not just in the obvious ways, "but also in whispers, in fine print, in invisible ink, in coded language."
Sorting out the ambiguities, Glanville said, merely prolongs the festering while the suffering continues.
"Being on guard about hate is not 'political,' " he wrote. "It is a matter of simple self-protection."

Texto completo: Next month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.
That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.
The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.
Read more commentary:
Trump's cognitive deficits seem worse. We need to know if he has dementia: Psychologist
Pete Buttigieg is priming America for a young, gay president, but probably not in 2020
You don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign
I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.
Growing up in the analogue era
In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures (for example, in 1970, I moved to a beach in Sinaloa, Mexico, instead of going to college). As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D. C. , with a grown-up career.
President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.
It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, "the sky was the limit. "
Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn’t go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.
While not everyone’s history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today’s spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.
Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D. C. , in Burlington, Vermont Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).
Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders’ similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, “bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier. ”
This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman’s humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist “vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the … suffocating force of the status quo. ”
Business values of the 1980s
While Sanders was stewing over the meaning of his life in the mid-1980s, 300 miles south, Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4. 5 million a year from his father’s clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.
Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for “getting even. ”
Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1. 17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.
In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were “entitled to massive write-offs," and "you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes. " Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common “sport” among real estate developers.
Thanks to my generation’s harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That’s as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.
The future might rest on electing a sufficiently “woke” candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.
Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I’ll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.
For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday denied reports that hundreds of migrants would be flown from the Mexican border to Florida and other areas in the US interior to lessen the workload at crowded Border Patrol facilities.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, also on Sunday, acknowledged that federal officials did initially alert local leaders of the possibility that migrants would be flown to two South Florida counties. But Trump appeared to blame the media for "false reporting."
"There are no plans to send migrants to northern or Coastal Border facilities, including Florida," Trump wrote on Twitter. "...Our country is FULL, will not, and cannot, take you in!"
The office of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida also said Sunday that Trump told him he didn't approve and wouldn't authorize the transportation of the immigrants.
The governor's spokeswoman Helen Ferre said DeSantis spoke with Trump on Saturday, two days after local officials reacted with alarm to a US Border Patrol notification that 1,000 migrants could be sent on a weekly basis to Palm Beach and Broward counties, starting in about two weeks.
After the plan was attacked by local leaders last week, federal officials initially said the flights were only being considered and nothing was happening immediately.
On Sunday, McAleenan said that Florida and other cities in the interior were no longer in consideration. He appeared on CBS's "Face the Nation" and said the plan "wasn't going to be an effective use of government resources."
DeSantis apparently had been caught off guard and said such flights would amount to "dumping" migrants on Florida. He appeared upset that Florida was even a consideration, especially after he recently signed a bill banning sanctuary cities and pledging to help federal immigration authorities.
Trump and DeSantis are close. The president endorsed DeSantis, which propelled him from underdog to winner in last year's governor's race.

RNC accepts money from Steve Wynn
President Trump has generally bucked the #MeToo movement, siding instead with the men who deny accusations of sexual assault or misconduct.
Now, the Republican National Committee appears to be following his lead.
Steve Wynn, the billionaire former casino mogul who resigned as chairman of Wynn Resorts and as finance chairman of the RNC last year after The Wall Street Journal revealed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades, has recently donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the committee.
On Thursday, he was spotted by television cameras arriving at a high-dollar fund-raising dinner for Trump and the committee, dressed in a red blazer and matching red tie.
The event, a 40-person dinner with the president on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, was hosted by Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and raised more than $5 million, according to Trump aides. Dinner attendees, in conversations after the event, did not mention that Wynn, 77, had been there.
It was not clear whether Trump and Wynn, who has denied the allegations, spoke privately at Lutnick's penthouse.
Politico reported last week that Wynn gave $248,500 to the Republican National Committee and an additional $150,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in April. In the past, both he and his wife have donated, but this time it was just him.
Republican officials insisted that there was a difference between holding the position of finance chairman while fighting off serious allegations of sexual misconduct, and simply donating money.
Still, the RNC's decision to accept money from Wynn — and to not return funds he contributed in the past — opens the fund-raising committee up to questions of hypocrisy.
Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the RNC, has frequently called for the Democratic National Committee to return all money received from Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who was accused by dozens of women of harassment, assault, and rape and who was a prolific Democratic donor and a close friend of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic National Committee has given away some of Weinstein's contributions. McDaniel has drawn a distinction between Wynn and Weinstein because, she said, Wynn denied the charges against him. But Weinstein, who was charged in New York with rape, has pleaded not guilty.

Carter finds a renaissance in 2020 Democratic scramble
Jimmy Carter carved an unlikely path to the White House in 1976 and endured humbling defeat after one term. Now, six administrations later, the longest-living chief executive in American history is reemerging from political obscurity at age 94 to win over his fellow Democrats once again.
A peanut farmer turned politician then worldwide humanitarian, Carter is taking on a special role as several Democratic candidates look to his family-run campaign after the Watergate scandal as the road map for toppling President Trump in 2020.
"Jimmy Carter is a decent, well-meaning person, someone who people are talking about again given the time that we are in," said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in an interview. "He won because he worked so hard, and he had a message of truth and honesty. I think about him all the time."
Klobuchar is one of at least three presidential hopefuls who've ventured to the tiny town of Plains, Ga., to meet with Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 91. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also have visited with the Carters and attended the former president's Sunday School lesson in Plains.
Carter had planned to teach at Maranatha Baptist Church again Sunday, but he is still recuperating at home days after hip replacement surgery following a fall as he was preparing for a turkey hunt.
"An extraordinary person," Buttigieg told reporters after meeting Carter. "A guiding light and inspiration," Booker said in a statement. Klobuchar has attended Carter's church lesson, as well, and says she e-mails with him occasionally. "He signs them 'JC,' " she said with a laugh.
It's quite a turnabout for a man who largely receded from party politics after his presidency, often without being missed by his party's leaders in Washington, where he was an outsider even as a White House resident.

#MeToo: Noncompetes trap women in abusive jobs

Texto completo: After decades of virtual silence, the #MeToo movement has publicized the epidemic of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The recent New York Times investigation of Sterling Jewelers exposes the depth of the problem and shows how long and hard women's fight for justice remains. Since women who complain about harassment face retaliation and even termination, often the only way to escape it is to find a new job. Yet for many women, continuing their careers with a new employer turns out to be impossible.
That is because of noncompete clauses. After they have resigned or even been fired, workers bound by noncompetes cannot accept employment in the same line of work or industry as their former employer for a specified period in a certain city, state or even the entire country. Nearly 30 million working people, including more than 12 million women, are locked into their jobs because of noncompete clauses.
Employers thus prevent their workers from leaving for employers offering higher wages, better benefits and dignity on the job. Incredibly, as a 2013 case in Florida shows, some employers even try to enforce noncompetes in court against workers who left after being subjected to alleged sexual harassment.
A federal agency has the power to put a stop to noncompetes. In March, the Open Markets Institute (where we both work), along with 19 labor and public interest organizations and 46 legal advocates and scholars, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to ban noncompetes under federal law. An FTC rule prohibiting noncompetes would help free women from abusive work environments.
Workers bound by a noncompete and looking to leave face three choices: 1) find a job in another line of work or industry, 2) move outside the geographic reach of the noncompete, or 3) accept unemployment for the duration of the noncompete.
Option 1 means accepting work outside one's experience and skills. Option 2 means uprooting one's family and severing social ties. Option 3 is possible only for the independently wealthy. As a practical matter, even when employers cannot or do not enforce them in court, noncompetes intimidate workers into staying with their employer.
Amazon warehouse workers, camp counselors, hair stylists, home health aides, investment managers, sandwich makers and yoga instructors are just some workers who have been bound by noncompete clauses. Amazon's (now discontinued) noncompete with warehouse staff prohibited these workers from working at effectively any retailer in the entire world for 18 months after leaving Amazon.
The deprivation of exit is especially harmful to women who face a serious threat of sexual assault and harassment on the job. In an economy in which less than 10% of women belong to a union and at-will employment is the norm, women have little bargaining power and can be dismissed for practically any reason or no reason at all.
One of the few sources of leverage for women workers is to leave for employment elsewhere, even if it means a demotion or pay cut. A study by three sociology professors found that in a two-year period, women who were targets of sexual harassment were 6.5 times more likely to change jobs than women who hadn't been targeted.
By depriving them of outside employment opportunities, noncompetes lock victims of harassment into abusive environments. The stories of noncompetes being weaponized against women who are simply trying to escape harassment are shocking.
In Florida, for example, one employer had the nerve to sue a woman who had left her job because of sexual harassment to work for another company in her industry. According to the employee, her employer failed to stop the harassment and left her with no choice but to leave the hostile work environment. The employer then sued her for violating the noncompete clause in her employment contract, arguing that no Florida court has held that sexual harassment voids the contract. Ultimately, the court dismissed the case because the employer failed to provide evidence to support its claims. One wonders whether the lawsuit was yet another act of retaliation against the employee for daring to speak out.
While Congress can and should ban noncompetes through legislation, the FTC already has the power to outlaw noncompetes for all workers. The need for a decisive regulatory action is clear.

Texto completo: Eaton Rapids Public Schools was honored to present four awards at the Eaton Rapids Chamber of Commerce dinner in early May. Over the next few weeks, I will highlight people who were the recipients of the awards. We recently brought back of Eaton Rapids Wall of Fame where a committee of Board members, staff, and community members select two alumni who have distinguished themselves. I wanted to highlight Andrea Bitely in this article.
Andrea's work background is really rich. Until just recently, Bitely had been at the Michigan Attorney General's office.
While at the Attorney General's office, Bitely managed both the day-to-day communications as well as several high-profile communications issues. She is adept at both online and traditional communications and has been quoted in media outlets ranging from the Mining Journal and Detroit News to the New York Times and FOX News.
Prior to joining the Michigan Attorney General's office, Bitely was the first person to be named director of social media for POLITICO, a Washington D.C.-based news outlet. The publication's Facebook and Twitter followers grew to more than 1 million under her leadership. She worked closely with representatives from social media companies to launch pilot projects at POLITICO to benefit news outlets worldwide.
Bitely cut her teeth in Washington at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce – first with the Institute for Legal Reform and then with the Chamber Foundation.
Recently, Truscott Rossman announced that Andrea will join the firm's Lansing office as its newest senior account executive. "Andrea is everything that a modern communications professional should be. She has outstanding relationships with media. She is well-versed in multiple digital media channels. She is cool and calm under pressure. But most of all, she knows how to tell a story that gets shared and seen across multiple platforms and motivates people into action. We look forward to putting all those skills to work on behalf of our clients," said Truscott Rossman President Ron Fournier, who is based in the firm's Detroit office.
As you all know, Andrea is a native of Eaton Rapids, a graduate of Eaton Rapids High School. She is an alumna of Western Michigan University where she majored in political science with an emphasis on public policy. She has also guest lectured on social media and political campaigns at the University of Michigan and has guest hosted numerous podcasts and radio programs.
Andrea's parents, Deb and Paul Malewski. were able to attend the dinner and share in the evening's festivities with her.
Andrea, you are now officially in ERPS's Wall of Fame.

Texto completo: Chicago native Barry Gifford began writing at age 11 – partly because his childhood (mostly spent living in hotels around the country, including the old Heidelberg in Jackson) offered up a constant cast of "characters" with their own endless stories to tell.
His long career has included more than 40 works of everything from poetry to fiction, nonfiction and screenplays – in addition to journalistic writing.
Gifford's latest pair of readers include cozy "reruns" of familiar stories that have been reformatted to make it easier for old and new fans to binge-read some of his best work at a relaxed pace.
"Southern Nights" offers up a Southern Gothic trilogy while "Sailor and Lula: Expanded Edition" places all eight installments of this couple's romance and adventures in one laid-back volume.
"My sense of narrative really came from watching late night black and white films on television and growing up in hotels, mostly among adults," Gifford said. "I was able to listen to all of their stories, make up my own and absorb a variety of dialects. Moving around added to the mix. Being in the company of my father's friends, most of whom had dubious occupations, served to supply the intrigue."
His works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry have appeared in many publications, including The New Yorker, Esquire, La Nouvelle Revue Française, El País, La Repubblica, Rolling Stone, Film Comment, El Universal and the New York Times. He has received awards from PEN, the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Library Association, the Writers Guild of America, and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation.
His film credits include "Wild at Heart," "Perdita Durango," "Lost Highway," "City of Ghosts," "Ball Lightning" and "The Phantom Father." He has also written librettos for operas composed by Toru Takemitsu, Ichiro Nodaira and Olga Neuwirth.
Today Gifford lives in California.
Tell me about your dichotomous growing-up years and how this has influenced your writing through the decades.
I was born in Chicago and moved to Key West, Florida, with my mother before I was a year old. She had health problems and was advised to live in milder climate. My father kept an apartment in the Hotel Nacional in Havana, so we visited him there.
Later I spent time in Tampa with an uncle who lived there; then my mother, after she divorced my father, had boyfriends in New Orleans and Jackson, so we spent time there and in Chicago, where I went to high school.
We lived mostly in hotels, including the old Heidelberg Hotel in Jackson.
Your recently released "Southern Nights" trilogy is a package of your Southern Gothic novels "Night People," "Arise and Walk" and "Baby Cat-Face" – packed with humor and drama. When were each of these novels originally published, and how do their stories still apply to American culture today?
The "Southern Nights" trilogy was published as separate novels during the 1990s. They deal in an often satirical but deadly serious way with racism and fundamentalist religion. They're tough, funny, and often violent, just like America.
"Sailor and Lula: Expanded Edition" is your newest release and contains every Sailor and Lula novel in the collection, including the eighth and last one, "The Up-Down." How can you explain the enduring likability of these characters, despite their flaws, among your readers?
Sailor and Lula have been described as the Romeo and Juliet of the Deep South. I hope people keep reading about them as long as they keep reading Shakespeare.
You've had a long and incredibly successful career as a writer in several different genres and have developed a loyal following. What do you think has continued to draw readers to your work?
I write in different forms about what interests me and never talk down to the reader. I like to think that, once in a while, I come close to telling the truth.
What can readers expect to see in future works?
It's possible that Sailor and Lula may be appearing soon in a TV series, with which I may have something to do. And I've got a novel-in-progress about Cassie Angola, a young African-American woman who appears as a little girl in the last of the Sailor and Lula novels, "The Up-Down." Ask me this question again after I finish it!
I see that your current book tour includes just a handful of cities. I know you spent some of your childhood in Jackson, but you spent parts of your childhood in lots of places! How did Jackson make that limited list?
I've known (Lemuria Book store owner) John Evans for close to 30 years, and . . . for me, he represents the best of Jackson. Lemuria Books is a treasure.
Signing
Barry Gifford will sign at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Lemuria Books in Jackson.

Texto completo: Grumpy Cat, the ubiquitous internet celebrity whose permanent scowl spoke for all of us in our darkest moments, died in the arms of her "mommy" on Tuesday, her family said on Friday. She was 7.
The cat, whose actual name is Tardar Sauce and who hailed from Arizona, died after complications arose from a urinary tract infection, her family wrote on Twitter.
"Besides being our baby and a cherished member of the family, Grumpy Cat has helped millions of people smile all around the world -- even when times were tough," according to the post.
Many cats have had moments of mini-fame on the internet, but few, if any, have had the reach and staying power of Grumpy Cat. She first rose to prominence six years ago, after her owner posted a photo to Reddit, captioned "Meet grumpy cat."
[Explore more cat exploits long before Youtube , or check out why Choupette, Karl Lagerfeld's cat, has a million reasons to purr .]
The sourpuss with the piercing look of contempt quickly became a meme, and placing bold words above and below her frown became a common way for humans to express grumpy thoughts.
Perhaps the most famous: "I had fun once. It was awful."
Grumpy Cat's visage was named the Meme of the Year at the 2013 Webby Awards, beating out "Gangnam Style" and "Harlem Shake." Many memes come and go, but her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, turned the cat's face into the center of a thriving business.

Her likeness appeared on nearly 900 items in an official shop, she made a television advertisement for "Honey Nut Cheerios," and she became the official "spokescat" of Friskies, a cat food brand. The cat starred in a Lifetime Christmas movie, "Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever," she was on the cover of New York Magazine, and her book hit No. 7 on The New York Times's advice, how-to and miscellaneous best-seller list.

Estimates ranged widely on how much Grumpy Cat was worth, though Ms. Bundesen disputed a 2014 report that the cat had earned her $ 100 million. In 2018, Ms. Bundesen won $ 710,000 in a copyright infringement suit against a coffee company that made Grumpy Cat Grumppuccino.
The cat's famous scowl was the result of feline dwarfism, her family said, and though she was a mixed breed, her owners were unsure of the specific mix.
On the cat's website, her owners maintain that Grumpy Cat wasn't grumpy at all.
"She is a super cute and cuddly kitty and loves to be held and rubbed," they wrote.

Tension stands at Riot Games; Forced arbitration policy will continue at video game maker, despite walkout by workers last week.

Texto completo: Riot Games will still require employees to go through arbitration with the company -- rather than a trial -- over complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination, the "League of Legends" video game maker said Thursday.
Riot's decision comes a week after more than 200 workers walked out of its Los Angeles headquarters to protest what employees have described as a culture of sexism at the company and its handling of two sexual discrimination lawsuits.
Citing the "complexities" of ongoing lawsuits, Riot said it will not change its employee agreements while in active litigation. Five current and former employees have sued the company in recent months, alleging gender-based discrimination, retaliation and harassment, as well as violations of California's Equal Pay Act.

Riot has disputed their claims, saying it has a "zero-tolerance policy on discrimination, harassment, retaliation, bullying and general toxicity." When asked to explain the policy and how the company defines "general toxicity," company spokesman Joe Hixson said in an email that the company is rewriting its code of conduct to include "more explicit infractions and consequences than we've defined in the past."
The company did not rule out allowing alternatives to arbitration in the future.
"We remain committed to having a firm answer around extending an opt-out to all Rioters when active litigation concludes," Riot said in a Thursday night blog post. "Everything we've heard will impact our discussions when we revisit arbitration and we hope to have an answer that will be satisfying to everyone."
Riot will give new employees the option to opt out of arbitration on individual sexual harassment claims, but only after current litigation is concluded, Hixson said.
Last month, the company pushed plaintiffs in two sexual discrimination lawsuits into arbitration, rather than allowing the cases to go to trial. Studies have shown that employees win less often in arbitration than they do in court.
"We're disappointed leadership doesn't seem to be considering any major changes to their active policy," employees Indu Reddy, Ronnie Blackburn and Jocelyn Monahan -- three leaders behind last week's walkout -- said in a statement Friday.
The leaders said they are weighing options for their next steps and will share information next week. "As we continue to pressure Riot to end forced arbitration, we are leveraging that teamwork and solidarity by involving more coworkers in the effort," they said.
Riot said it is starting an employee forum for participating in "formal discussions" on diversity and inclusion. The company said it has also invited a "diverse" group of workers to review parts of the company's code of conduct.
The company, a division of Chinese internet behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd., was founded in 2006 by two friends from business school. It has become a giant in the world of gaming and esports.
The culture of gaming has been beset by conflict in recent years, starting with a controversy known as Gamergate, which served as something of a preview to the contentious online conflicts of the Trump era.
Riot has been criticized since articles late last year described an environment of casual sexism and harassment. Over the last year, Riot has suspended its chief operating officer for two months over alleged misconduct and brought in a Harvard Business School professor to advise the company on "cultural transformation."
Employees at Riot said a bunker mentality has set in at the company in response to the public scrutiny. Walkout organizers encouraged participants to wear Riot-branded gear to the demonstration to illustrate that their goal was to improve the company, not destroy it.
The company said in its Thursday blog post that the walkout was "an important moment in our company's transformation, and it reaffirmed our commitment to keep fighting to make this the company we believe it can be."
The employee activism at Riot reflects an increasing focus on forced arbitration and an uptick in worker protests in the tech industry.
In November, 20,000 workers at Google staged a walkout after the New York Times published an article disclosing that the company had given an executive a $90-million exit package despite credible charges of sexual misconduct.
Google quickly agreed not to require forced arbitration in cases of sexual misconduct, and in March the company announced it would eliminate forced arbitration for employees altogether. Uber and Lyft reversed forced-arbitration agreements last year.

The media shouldn't give a bully a bullhorn

Texto completo: I was talking to an acquaintance recently about Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign.
He liked the Massachusetts Democrat's detailed policies and was impressed with her recent CNN town hall presentation.
But he couldn't back the senator because she doesn't really stand a chance in the 2020 contest. Why not, I asked.
He answered me with a rueful shrug, accompanied by one word: "Pocahontas."
That, of course, is the nickname President Trump has tagged Warren with - a reference to her having claimed Native American ancestry, including on law school faculty forms in the 1980s. (She does have some such ancestry,but not very much, a DNA test revealed; Warren says she was merely repeating family lore.)
This episode was certainly not Warren's finest hour - but hardly something that should be disqualifying, especially when compared with the horror show of deceit that is Trump himself.
But the nickname has stuck. And some people can't get beyond it - any more than they can get beyond "Crooked Hillary" or the multitude of other slams from "Crazy Bernie" Sanders for the Vermont senator to "Lyin' Ted" Cruz of Texas. Or, for that matter, the "Failing New York Times" - which, of course, it isn't.
Trump has a kind of dark intuitive genius for these coinages, something he's been plying for decades. (Back in the 1980s, Trump-the-developer referred to then-state assemblyman Jerry Nadler, now House Judiciary chairman, as "Fat Jerry" or "Waddler.")
"Consciously or not, Trump is feeding us nuggets packed with enormous linguistic power," Jon Allsop wrote in 2017 in Columbia Journalism Review.
"They appeal to a childlike desire to make an easily digestible morality tale of a complicated world."
They are often false and always meant to bully. And the news media must stop trafficking in them.
Journalists may not be able to ignore these nicknames altogether, but they should stop doing Trump's dirty work for him: amplifying their power through prominent placement and frequent, unquestioning repetition.
When Trump recently tagged Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with the nickname "Alfred E. Neuman" - an effort to make the Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan war veteran into a buffoon - the news media responded as it often does to Trumpian distractions: With a full round of breathless, clickable coverage.
Some of media attention focused on the presidential candidate's response - that Buttigieg had to research the name of the Mad Magazine cover boy. That was followed by Mad Magazine's riposte that they had to look up who Buttigieg was. And on it went.
All told, it was all less harmful, probably, than Trump's recently coined name for former vice president Joe Biden - "SleepyCreepy Joe." The worse the perceived political threat, perhaps, the more vicious the nickname.
The media, though, largely treats these labels as entertainment, wrote Allsop more recently - "not the subtle, dangerous manipulation of political discourse they actually represent."
And while Trump's legion of critics see his risible hair and puffed-up ego as fodder for taunts (like "Cheeto Jesus," in author Rick Wilson's phrase), the news media rarely stoop to repeating them.
It's high time to recognize what's going on here and to do something about it.
I often hear from readers and from anti-Trump voters that news organizations should ignore Trump's tweets or give him far less attention. In other words, they should cut off his oxygen supply of attention.
I can't agree. What the president of the United States says, even in a tweet, amounts to an official statement. We need to cover them, and him, rigorously and thoroughly.
But just as we've learned to fact-check Trump - and call out his lies when appropriate - we need to learn to stop amplifying these poisonous nicknames.
Cover them as part of a story? Examine and analyze them? Sure.
But don't constantly repeat them, don't treat them as "all in good fun."
And don't give them prominence without context.
Never again should one of these nicknames appear in the following ways: In a headline. In a media organization's tweet. In a bottom-of-the-screen TV chyron. In a news alert.
It's in those minimalist settings that they do the most harm.
Trump, of course, has his own powerful megaphones on social media and in his rallies and speeches.
And, granted, politics is a rough-and-tumble business, not known for its emphasis on civility and decency. The knives are always out.
But when the news media turn on their brightest spotlights, these nicknames take on greater credibility and power. As propaganda always does, they sink into our consciousness as something that feels like a kind of truth.
That makes journalists complicit in Trump's insidious ways. His jokes were never funny, and shouldn't be treated as if they are.

Texto completo: Move over, MAGA hat. MATH may be the next big thing in political headgear.
Yes, as in mathematics. Or as 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang suggests at his rain-soaked rally in New York City Tuesday night: “Make America Think Harder.”
The catchphrase is as good as any to describe the people wearing those hats in Washington Square Park. They’re the type to say they’re sick of emotional appeals from career politicians. They cheer when their candidate – a corporate lawyer turned CEO turned philanthropist – starts a sentence with, “I looked at the numbers” or “I did the math.” The word “rational” comes up a lot in conversation.
Which seems almost ironic, considering Mr. Yang’s banner policy is to give every American adult $1,000 a month regardless of employment status or wages. It’s a version of universal basic income, and sounds like something out of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ playbook.
Yet Mr. Yang frames his “Freedom Dividend” less in terms of political ideology than actionable steps. It’s a counterbalance, he argues, to the millions of middle class jobs that have been and will be lost to automation. “I’m a capitalist,” he told The New York Times in 2018, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”
The 2,500 supporters at his Manhattan rally dig it. They say Mr. Yang’s direct approach, his attention to policy (his site lists dozens of proposals), and his effort to avoid riling people up or demonizing them are a balm in an era of hyperbole and partisanship. Sure, he’s polling between 1% and 3% and ranks near the bottom in name recognition among the 23 Democrats in the race. And they know he’s faced criticisms about attracting fans from the less-than-savory regions of Reddit and 4chan, the discussion sites where his campaign first started to gain ground.
But supporters say it’s too soon to write him off, especially since he qualified for the first televised debate in June. He may be a long shot, but anything is possible in an era where a reality TV star occupies the White House. To them, he’s speaking the language of Americans in search of bold solutions to the nation’s problems.
“He makes a really radical argument, yet all his reasoning is commonsense, straightforward, non-ideological, very practical,” says Jason Yung, a New York University graduate student in interactive technology who started the Brooklyn chapter of the Yang Gang – what Yang supporters call themselves. “It’s so fresh.”
Universal basic income Mr. Yang grew up in Schenectady, New York, to Taiwanese immigrant parents who met in grad school in California. He studied economics at Brown, went to Columbia Law, and worked at an international law firm in New York. Later, he launched an internet nonprofit that folded in 2001, then helped run a health care startup before making a small fortune in the test-prep business.
In 2011, Mr. Yang started Venture For America (VFA), an organization that recruits top graduates for companies in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis. What he saw in middle America led Mr. Yang to conclude that economic inequality and dissatisfaction in this country comes primarily from people displaced as industrial technology improves. The Freedom Dividend is the main plank of his proposed solution.
“We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa. All of the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win,” Mr. Yang tells the crowd. “Donald Trump is not the disease. He is a symptom. He’s a manifestation of this automation wave that’s now ripping through our economy.”
Mr. Yang has been running on that message since he entered the presidential race in November 2017. The idea began making the rounds online, generating memes that celebrated his plan to essentially give people money. The Yang Gang was born.
But it wasn’t until February, when Mr. Yang guested on comedian and mixed martial arts commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, that he really went viral. The episode’s version on YouTube had close to 3 million views as of this writing. At the rally in Manhattan, supporters often cited the show as the place where they either first heard about Mr. Yang or became real fans.
Mr. Yung, the NYU grad student, stumbled onto the Yang campaign for an assignment that involved designing his own political party. “All the stuff I wanted to do, he already has,” Mr. Yung says. When he heard Mr. Yang on Mr. Rogan’s show, “I really was like, ‘Oh my God. He can talk the talk,’” Mr. Yung recalls. He started the Brooklyn Yang Gang shortly after.
Tami Joy Schlichter, a Yang volunteer who spearheaded Tuesday’s rally, also credits “The Joe Rogan Experience,” and the podcast “Freakonomics,” for introducing her to Mr. Yang. Ms. Schlichter runs a digital marketing firm, but her passion is mathematical neuroscience – A.I. – and its effect on worker displacement.
“I was like, ‘Thank God someone is paying attention to this issue,’” she says, holding up a colossal cutout of a $1,000 bill with Mr. Yang’s face where Grover Cleveland’s should be.
“Everyone is tired of all of the emotional drama,” Ms. Schlichter adds. “We just want someone that’s going to pay attention to an issue, do the research, and solve it according to what the data says.”
‘It’s going to be a party’ Hours before the rally starts, a man in a printed jumpsuit, fur hat, and oversize rhinestone glasses hands out Yang 2020 flyers to passersby at Washington Square Park. “It’s going to be a party,” he says.
The man is Paperboy Prince of the Suburbs – Paperboy for short – a rapper and self-professed internet meme activist who caught the Yang bug when he heard Mr. Yang say in an interview that his ideas are more important than winning the race. “That really ignited me,” Paperboy says. So far he’s written three songs for Mr. Yang, the latest of which is called “Humanity First,” after the Yang campaign slogan.
Hamed Salimi, a software developer and Iranian immigrant who lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, was hardcore for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr. Salimi likes the way Mr. Yang has presented universal basic income as a way to balance out the country’s increasingly uneven economic scales. And though he has no sympathy for President Trump, he appreciates Mr. Yang’s effort to reach conservatives by appearing on Fox News and right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro’s show.
“I really like that he’s not scared and he doesn’t see them as enemies,” Mr. Salimi says. 
Mr. Yang often says he’s drawn former Trump supporters into his camp (though none of those interviewed in New York fell into this category). He’s touted it as proof that with the right message, partisan divides can be overcome. But he has received criticism for the attention he’s getting from the internet’s darker corners, where the racist and sexist ideas of the alt-right tend to fester. Buzzfeed reported in March that one of his staffers had been doxxed and harassed by 4chan users who took issue when she tweeted that Mr. Yang’s universal basic income policy is feminist.
The reason appears to be that many 4chan users like the idea of getting $1,000 a month in free money, not that Mr. Yang is courting them or is in sympathy with racist or misogynistic ideology. In fact, he’s repeatedly disavowed these groups. “Anyone who spends, like, five seconds looking into me or my background or my beliefs or my platform would be like, ‘This guy is the least white nationalist dude ever,’” Mr. Yang told Vox.
Indeed, his supporters are less concerned about who else Mr. Yang is attracting than how the media is treating him. “The press is going to get caught with their pants down at the Iowa caucus,” says Benjamin Springer, a former police officer and Army veteran from Point Pleasant, New Jersey, who says he’s given about $200 to the Yang campaign. “He’s known within online communities.”
“I don’t know that he has a chance,” Mr. Yung, the NYU grad student, admits, “but I feel the energy. I’m hopeful.”

Texto completo: The courting of Brides magazine had none of the meet-cutes and grand gestures often described in its glossy pages.
Condé Nast, the publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker, rather unceremoniously put the publication on the market last year as part of a cost-cutting campaign. The online brand Dotdash was among the early suitors, and on Wednesday, the two sides came to an agreement. Neither would disclose the terms of the sale.
"It wasn't like there was crazy bidding at the end," said Neil Vogel, the head of Dotdash, which is part of InterActiveCorp (IAC), the company behind Tinder, Match and OKCupid. "It's clear to us that there wasn't a ton of investment behind this in the last few years."
Dotdash plans to scrap the 85-year-old print magazine and redesign Brides.com. The majority of the editorial staff, including the executive director, Lisa Harman Gooder, will make the move from Condé Nast's Lower Manhattan offices to Dotdash's facilities in Midtown, the company said.
"We're not buying this for print," Mr. Vogel said. "We're buying this for the editorial team and for digital."
Condé Nast, which is owned by Advance Publications, has been getting leaner while moving closer to its digital future, laying off employees, limiting print production and leasing out floors at 1 World Trade Center.
Once known for endless expense accounts and top-of-the-market salaries, the magazine publisher put Brides up for sale last summer, along with Golf Digest and the glossy fashion book W. On Monday, Discovery Inc. bought Golf Digest for $ 35 million; W is still available.
The number of print readers for Brides wilted over the last five years, with circulation falling 4 percent, to a little more than 300,000. Those about to walk down the aisle these days are more likely to browse wedding sites or scroll through Instagram than run to a newsstand. Single-copy sales dropped accordingly, to roughly a third of what they were in 2014, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
Bridal magazines were once so lucrative that Condé Nast placed a big bet on the category in 2002 when it bought a similar publication, Modern Bride, from Primedia for $ 52 million; its sibling company at the time, Fairchild Publications, acquired another competitor, Elegant Bride, from Pace Communications in 2003. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, Condé Nast shut down both titles.
Brides, the oldest bridal magazine in the United States, started in 1934 as a publication mailed free of charge to women whose wedding announcements appeared in newspaper society pages, according to "One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding," by Rebecca Mead. Its original title was So You're Going to Be Married.
Condé Nast acquired the magazine's former publisher, Brides House, shortly before Samuel I. Newhouse Sr. bought a controlling interest in the company in 1959. Then titled The Bride's Magazine, the publication fit in snugly among Vogue, Glamour and House & Garden. The name of the magazine was eventually shortened to Bride's, and the apostrophe fell off in 2005.
The magazine ran its first article on same-sex ceremonies in 2003. Three years later, it went online. In 2012, it became the first Condé Nast publication to be led by an African American, when Keija Minor was named editor in chief.
Under Ms. Minor, who stepped down in 2017, and her successor, Ms. Gooder, Brides expanded its digital presence. Brides.com had 3.6 million unique visitors in March, more than double the number in 2015, according to comScore.
The magazine's new owner, Dotdash, was a repository of answers to online queries like "how to beer-batter chicken" in its previous incarnation, About.com. Started in the late 1990s, About.com was bought by The New York Times in 2005. It was sold to IAC, whose chairman is the billionaire media mogul Barry Diller, in 2012.
Dotdash is now a collection of sites focused on topics like travel and home décor. When the company changed its name from About.com to Dotdash, said Mr. Vogel, the chief executive, he told IAC executives that he envisioned the brand as "what the future of Condé Nast should be."
With Brides, Dotdash will compete against WeddingWire and The Knot, which have spent years doling out advice on floral arrangements and bachelorette parties (a.k.a. #bachbashes).
In the first quarter of 2019, Dotdash's revenue increased 13 percent, to $ 34 million, IAC announced in its most recent earnings report. The company hopes to stay on that upward trend with the help of its latest addition.
"We're capitalists," Mr. Vogel said. "We like money, and we like selling ads."

Koons Work Sets Mark With $91.1 Million Sale

Texto completo: A shiny stainless steel sculpture created by Jeff Koons in 1986, inspired by a child's inflatable toy, sold at Christie's on Wednesday night for $ 91.1 million with fees, smashing the record at auction for a work by a living artist, set just last November by David Hockney.
Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, made the winning bid for Mr. Koons's 1986 "Rabbit" from an aisle seat near the front of the salesroom. He was seated near Peter Brant, the collector and private museum-owner, and Jeffrey Deitch, the dealer.
It was the ultimate prize among six works offered at Christie's from the collection of the magazine publisher S.I. Newhouse Jr., who died in 2017. Estimated to raise at least $ 50 million, this sculpture, made in an edition of three and one artist's proof, was the last example left in private hands, according to Christie's.
The price, surpassing the $ 90.2 million with fees achieved, again at Christie's, for Mr. Hockney's 1972 painting, "Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures)," confirmed how Mr. Koons's metal sculptures have become the ultimate billionaire trophies produced during the contemporary art boom of the 1980s and '90s. The Hockney milestone came at the expense of Mr. Koons, the previous record-holder, whose "Balloon Dog (Orange)" sold at auction for $ 58.4 million in November 2013.
Critics pointed out that the "Rabbit" sculpture elegantly and enigmatically alludes to earlier pieces by such artists as Constantin Brancusi, Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol.
"I always thought it would be in the pantheon," said Mr. Deitch. "It was instantly embraced by artists and cultural critics, and it's kept its resonance for all these years."
This validation is all the sweeter for Mr. Koons, whose career trajectory has been contradictory, controversial and uneven. In 2017, slowing demand for some of his more recent works necessitated a major downsizing of his studio. Auction prices for his most valuable sculptures have also slumped. Since 2014, the most recent spike in sales of contemporary art, the highest price paid for a Koons sculpture at auction was $ 22.8 million, for the colored aluminum sculpture "Play Doh," according to the Artnet database of salesroom prices.
Mr. Koons has been embroiled in suits accusing him of copying, and in 2016, he upset the French cultural establishment by giving Paris a colorfully upbeat "Bouquet of Tulips" sculpture, inspired by the Statue of Liberty, as a memorial to victims of recent terrorist attacks in France.
"There are so many strange, disconcerting aspects to Jeff Koons, his art and his career that it is hard to quite know how to approach" it, Roberta Smith wrote in the The New York Times, reviewing his retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2014, then its largest survey devoted to a single artist.
His work ranges from the notorious pictures that depict the artist in flagrante with his then-wife, Ilona Staller, known in her porn-star days as La Cicciolina, to knowingly kitsch sculptures like one of Michael Jackson with Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee, to his reflective, oversize "Rabbit" that "turns the hare into a space-invader of unknown origin," Ms. Smith wrote.
In all, the six contemporary works from the Newhouse collection raised $ 115 million Wednesday evening. On Monday evening, five Impressionist and modern works owned by Mr. Newhouse had raised $ 101 million. Before this week, this group of 11 had been estimated at $ 130 million.
Other notable sales included a Louise Bourgeois "Spider" cast in 1997, which sold for $ 32 million, a record for the artist and the second-highest price paid at auction for a work by a woman.
Because Christie's offered the two choicest estate collections of the week, the sale was packed with classic works by major names of American postwar and contemporary art. The auction began with 11 works from the Robert B. and Beatrice C. Mayer family, based in Chicago. Buying directly from dealers in the 1960s, the Mayers amassed a formidable collection of Pop Art.
"They were important collectors, and they bought early," said David Nisinson, a collector and art adviser in New York. "Christie's had a lot of fresh material from well-known collectors that hadn't been seen for years."
The pick of the Mayer works was Robert Rauschenberg's 1964 silk-screen painting, "Buffalo II," evoking the turbulent political climate after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. It sold for $ 88.8 million with fees. The couple had acquired the painting in 1965 from the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York.
"It's a very significant painting," said Mr. Nisinson. "And Rauschenberg has been undervalued compared to other artists."
Most of Mr. Rauschenberg's most innovative works from the 1950s and '60s, particularly his trailblazing "Combines," have long been held in museums and rarely appear on the market. This early silk-screen painting, packed with evocative imagery, is the most significant Rauschenberg to appear at auction in years. The previous high for Rauschenberg had been $ 18.6 million in 2015, according to Artnet. Another Mayer prize was Roy Lichtenstein's "Kiss," from 1962, which brought in $ 31.1 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The U.S. military gave a top British general a public tongue-lashing Tuesday after he told reporters at the Pentagon that Iran does not pose a threat to coalition troops in the Middle East.
"There's been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," British Army Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, deputy commander of the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition, said Tuesday in a video press briefing from Baghdad. "We're aware of their presence, clearly, and we monitor them along with a whole range of others because that's the environment we're in." The Pentagon has increased U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf over the last week, citing “troubling and escalatory” threats from Tehran.

Hours later, the top spokesman for the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East issued a stark statement contradicting Ghika, saying the Pentagon has put U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq on heightened alert.
Ghika's comments "run counter to identified credible threats available to intelligence from U.S. and allies regarding Iranian-backed forces in the region," Capt. Bill Urban said.
U.S. Central Command, working with the anti-ISIS coalition, "has increased the force posture level for all service members" in Iraq and Syria, Urban added. The coalition "is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq."
Ghika emphasized throughout his briefing that Iran was not in his wheelhouse. "I have no part of Iran in any of my orders, in any of my directives, or in any of my planning documents. Iran is no part of our mission," he told reporters who repeatedly asked about possible Iranian threats.
The Pentagon deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a task force of B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf last week, followed by an additional ship and a Patriot missile defense battery. The New York Times reported Monday that U.S. officials reviewed a plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Gulf if Iran attacked U.S. forces, but President Trump denied the report Tuesday.
“I think it’s fake news," Trump said. "Hopefully, we’re not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”
The State Department issued an order Wednesday requiring all nonemergency staff to leave Iraq, though specific details regarding the threat posed by Iran remain unclear. U.S. allies are skeptical of a potential threat, with U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warning that Europe is "very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended, really, on either side, but ends with some kind of conflict."
The Trump administration and European allies have been split on Iran since the president withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement a year ago. Iran has threatened to increase its nuclear activities in breach of the deal unless the European signatories agree to new terms within the next two months.

Texto completo: Barry Grodenchik, concejal Demócrata de Queens, admitió finalmente ayer haber acosado sexualmente a una empleada del Concejo Municipal durante más de un año , luego de haberlo negado el mes pasado.
En consecuencia, el concejal Grodenchik aceptó someterse a un entrenamiento contra el acoso sexual por su propia cuenta y renunciar a la presidencia del Comité de Parques y Recreación.
Según la denunciante, Grodenchik le daba tantos abrazos y besos no deseados que evitó reunirse con él.
“Entiendo que mis acciones causaron (…) vergüenza, estrés e incomodidad, y angustia emocional “, dijo Grodenchik con la cabeza gacha, citado por New York Post.
“Lamento profundamente mi conducta y cualquier daño sufrido (…) como resultado de mi conducta”, dijo ante el Comité de Normas y Ética. Luego salió de la sala de audiencias y dejó atrás a los reporteros.
El Demócrata de 59 años, que ha representado a Queens en el Concejo desde 2015, renunció a una audiencia completa sobre las acusaciones al admitir “discriminación y acoso a una empleada” no identificada, según el presidente del Comité de Ética, Steven Matteo (R-Staten Island).
“Ha expresado arrepentimiento por causar el daño al personal debido a su género, y el deseo de cambiar su comportamiento”, dijo Matteo.
“Teniendo en cuenta lo que se admitió, más de un año de abrazos y besos no deseados, ¿por qué se le permite permanecer en el Concejo?”, preguntó el abogado Kevin Mintzer, quien se aseguró un acuerdo de $545 mil dólares en 2015 para dos mujeres que acusaron al ex asambleísta Vito López de acoso sexual.
Grodenchik podría postularse para otro mandato de cuatro años en 2021.
En abril, inicialmente había negado las acusaciones, diciendo en una declaración que sólo había estrechado brevemente las manos y abrazado a “varias personas” después de una reunión, recordó The New York Times.

PRESERVING HISTORY

Texto completo: The Greenwich Village theater that broke the law punishing onstage depictions of homosexuality. The Staten Island home of New York State's onetime poet laureate and self-described "black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet." The decommissioned firehouse in SoHo where gay rights activists plotted to "zap" politicians for their stances on civil rights legislation.
On Tuesday morning, New York City took the first formal step closer to legally mandating the preservation of those buildings, and three others, connected to the history of the civil rights movement for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people.
In a succession of six unanimous "aye" votes, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission added the six buildings to its consideration calendar. The city has individually designated 1,415 landmarks since 1965, a classification that bars certain changes to the sites without official approval, according to commission spokeswoman Zodet Negrón.
Of those, only one landmark is solely designated for LGBTQ relevance: the Stonewall Inn, site of the riots beginning June 28, 1969, against the NYPD's then-commonplace raids of bars frequented by LGBTQ patrons. The events at Stonewall, landmarked in 2015, are credited with jump-starting the modern LGBTQ movement.
Negrón said a final vote on the six buildings is expected before the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

The buildings are:
Gay Activists Alliance Firehouse, 99 Wooster St., Manhattan. Called the city's "first gay community center," the alliance had its most active years at the former firehouse, from 1971 to 1974. Activists organized sit-ins, picket lines and confrontational "zaps" of newsmakers, but also held Saturday night dance parties. The alliance, first to adopt the Greek letter lambda as a symbol of the movement, affixed it on a large shield on the building's front. The interior was partially destroyed by arson in 1974.
Women's Liberation Center, 243 W. 20th St., Manhattan. Operated between 1972 and 1987, the center was symbolic of some lesbians' break away from the then male-dominated groups and housed feminist social service groups, women's political committees and lesbian organizations. "At a time when some feminists rejected the voices of lesbians," commission researcher Margaret Herman said Tuesday, "the Women's Liberation Center intentionally welcomed them."
The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center, 208 W. 13th St., Manhattan. The former schoolhouse has helped the LGBTQ community through groups including the Partnership for the Homeless, S.A.G.E. and Community Health Project, an HIV clinic. A partnership at the center contributed 1,200 panels to the AIDS memorial quilt, and in 1986, helped pass the city's law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Caffe Cino, 31 Cornelia St., Manhattan. From 1958 to 1968, the building's commercial storefront helped birth Off-Off-Broadway and the city's first gay theater. It hosted poetry readings and experimental theater. Among those who got their starts at Caffe Cino: Tom Eyen, who would write Tony-winning "Dreamgirls" and John Guare, author of "Six Degrees of Separation." The building is now home to the Drunken Munkey restaurant and bar. The New York Times wrote in 1965 that, unlike Broadway, "Homosexuality, incest and sadomasochism are treated frequently and sometimes humorously." Theaters like Caffe Cino that depicted "sex degeneracy, or sex perversion," such as homosexuality, could be padlocked under a law in effect until 1967, Negrón said.
James Baldwin's apartment house, 137 W. 71st St., Manhattan. Harlem-born James Baldwin, essayist, novelist and civil rights activist, spent most of the last two decades of his life there on the Upper West Side, purchasing the converted former row house in 1965 for his family. Baldwin, who was gay, split his time between Europe and the United States and worked in the apartment on screenplays, stage plays, novels and corresponded with other prominent figures. Among Baldwin's visitors to the building were Toni Morrison, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie.
Audre Lorde's home, 207 St. Paul's Ave., Staten Island. Born in 1934 to Caribbean immigrants, Lorde was a librarian, writer, poet and later a professor and theorist at Hunter and John Jay colleges. She spoke at the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights and co-founded the publisher Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. Lorde also wrote the book, "I Am Your Sister: Black Women Organizing Across Sexualities." She was the state's poet laureate

Pro-Israel group bringing big names to Mar-a-Lago event

Texto completo: On Sept. 18, about three months after Jason Sullivan testified before a grand jury investigating potential collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia, the self-proclaimed “Wizard of Twitter” who said he worked “behind the curtain” to elect Trump, created the American Pro-Israel political action committee.
To raise money for its mission to “elect candidates who embrace the Judeo-Christian worldview” and “support the
nation of Israel as America’s closest ally,” the Texas-based super PAC decided to hold its first fundraiser on Nov. 24 at Mar-a-Lago. Trump, known to show up at events sponsored by his base, made an appearance.
Four months later, APIP decided to hold another fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, on March 16. And tonight, APIP will hold its third fundraiser in five months at the president’s private club — an uncommon number of fundraisers so close together during a single social season.
As fewer of the traditional philanthropic galas book events at Mar-a-Lago, a growing share of organizations with a public policy focus are steadily making Trump’s Southern White House a hub for political networking, alliance-building and fundraising.
Like the tranche of other conservative religious charities that appeared at Mar-a-Lago after the Charlottesville exodus, APIP represents a slice of the president’s religious base — fervent, pro-Israel Christians and Jews.
Neither Sullivan, who worked for longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, nor APIP’s treasurer, who signed APIP’s campaign finance reports, could be reached to explain why the group has had so many fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago and if the president’s private club has proved to be a lucrative venue for politicking.
What is known is that APIP has brought some of the biggest names in Trump’s religious orbit to Mar-a-Lago: Apopka-based Pastor Paula White Cain, whom Trump picked to deliver a prayer at his inauguration and head his Evangelical Advisory Board; Pastor Mark Burns, dubbed “Trump’s Top Pastor” by Time magazine; and New York Times best-selling author Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, a Messianic Jewish follower of Jesus.
Today’s daylong event begins at Temple Beth El in West Palm Beach, where a roster of conservative religious notables will speak. Rabbi Leonid Feldman, of Temple Beth El, said he was approached by APIP to host the event — the first anniversary of Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The event features conservative and controversial Jewish radio talk-show host Dennis Prager and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, dubbed “the most famous Rabbi in America” by The Washington Post and Newsweek, according to his website.
Trump has a lock on the evangelical vote, winning even some of the Jewish vote in Florida, a crucial swing state that boasts the country’s third-largest Jewish population. That could pose a threat to the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a devout, pro-Israel Christian and acolyte of the president, will help the cause later this month when he travels to Israel with dozens of other officials on a trade mission. DeSantis will also hold a Cabinet meeting during the trip.
Although Jewish voters have historically voted overwhelmingly Democrat, Trump’s decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, his harsh stance on Iran, recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, coupled with comments by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, denouncing Israel’s settlement policy and military campaigns in the occupied Palestinian territories, has swayed some conservative Jews, Feldman said.
“Quite a few say, ‘I cannot vote for Democrats with anti-Semitism on the floor of Congress,’” Feldman said. “A lot of my people say they’ve crossed the line.”
Still, Feldman said today’s event has nothing to do with the president even though some of the evangelical speakers are ardent Trump supporters. As for the gala at Mar-a-Lago tonight, that is a separate event, Feldman added.
Tickets start at $1,000 for the Mar-a-Lago event. Spending $100,000 for “founder table seating” comes with a VIP tour of the White House, according to APIP’s website. Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show APIP spent $38,871 at Mar-a-Lago through the end of 2018 — the most recent reports available. The PAC also paid $10,000 to Sullivan for board compensation and $2,124 for travel.
Other spending by the PAC includes $25,000 to Ramiro Pena, senior pastor of Christ the King Baptist Church in Waco, Texas. Pena, who once said “God has his hand on Donald Trump,” is a vocal supporter of the president and his stance on border security. Pena also received $6,329 for travel expenses.
Another newly formed pro-Israel group, The Truth About Israel, debuted at Mar-a-Lago in February 2018 after seizing a date opened up when another pro-Israel group, American Friends of Magen David Adom, Israel’s ambulance, blood services and disaster-relief organization, left in the Charlottesville exodus.
Speakers and guests included Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon, Trump superfans Diamond and Silk, GOP Congressman Brian Mast and DeSantis, who was a congressman at the time.
“I’m reading about these groups pulling out of Mar-a-Lago and I’m thinking, ‘This is ridiculous,’” event organizer Steven Alembik told The Palm Beach Post at the time. “Somebody needs to take a stand here and do something. My president is my president. I like what he stands for ... He’s got Israel’s back.”
Alembik declined to comment.

David Ramsey: Let's emphasize victims of school shootings instead of evil murderers

Texto completo: School shooters repulse, horrify and exhaust us. We fully understand that these shooters are despicable, inexplicable and indefensible.
When two massively selfish shooters invaded Columbine High School 20 years ago, we tried to understand and explain. Maybe the shooters were bullied. (They weren’t.) Maybe their minds were polluted by video games. (They weren’t.) Maybe they were a slice from a weird collection of debauched juveniles who wore trench coats. (They weren’t.)
The shooters glowed with evil as stars of the massacre, just as they intended. But slowly, we learned. We emphasize victims over murderers. We quit offering subtle excuses for the inexcusable.
We are no longer fascinated.
The two shooters who murdered one student and injured eight others in Highlands Ranch last week quickly faded as we mourned and celebrated the victims. We placed a light on Kendrick Castillo, who died a hero. We searched for the elusive secret to safe schools.
We paid closer attention to Tom and Caren Teves, who founded the “No Notoriety” movement after their son, Alex, was shot to death, with 11 others, in August 2012 at a movie theater in suburban Denver. They lead a campaign to reveal school shooters as creeps.
“Portray them for what they are,” Tom told The Associated Press. “They’re horrible human beings that are completely skewed in their perception of reality, and their one claim to fortune is sneaking up behind you and shooting you.”
Well said, Tom.
This crusade to place the violent and repulsive in the shadows is not new.
On Oct. 30, 1901, readers could pick from 33 New York Times front-page stories, including one that told of Mrs. H.S. Black failing to sneak a $35,000 necklace purchased in Europe ($1.05 million in 2019 dollars) past custom authorities. She faced today’s equivalent of a $600,000 fine.
Front-page readers did not see a story on the execution of Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated President William McKinley 53 days earlier in Buffalo. Czolgosz was electrocuted at 7:12 a.m. in Auburn, N.Y., 250 miles from Times Square.
Czolgosz’s clothes and personal items were immediately burned. And after an autopsy, quicklime and 10 gallons of sulfuric acid were poured on his corpse. Within 12 hours, Czolgosz’s body disintegrated to virtually nothing.
New York state, the Times reported, “was determined that the prisoner, despite the enormity of his crime, should gain no undue notoriety.” No notoriety, circa 1901. The attitude made sense. From 1865 to 1901, assassins murdered three American presidents, Abraham Lincoln, Civil War hero James Garfield and McKinley.
Much about Czolgosz’s rapid conviction and execution is troubling. His entire trial sprinted by in 8½ hours, and his lawyer ended his “defense” by apologizing for defending him. Czolgosz was likely insane, a man who spent his days sleeping, usually under trees. He even slept soundly the night before his execution. Guards had to shake him awake before leading him to the death chair.
But there was genius in trying to ensure this contemptible man gained precious little real estate in America’s imagination. The Times exiled the execution story to Page 5.
When I read of the men who blew up the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168 girls, boys, women and men, I’m outraged. When I think of the young man who gunned down 31 innocents at Virginia Tech, I’m disgusted.
But I’m normal.
The Columbine shooters read accounts of the Oklahoma City tragedy and hatched a plot to top it, hoping to kill more than 600. The Columbine shooters, in turn, became role models to unhinged young people who harbor strange and deadly ideas.
“There are a number of problems with the intense media focus on mass shooting perpetrators,” writes Jaclyn Schildkraut, an expert on mass shootings and a professor at State University of New York-Oswego. “First, they are explicitly seeking fame, and the media is helping them to achieve this end. The realization that this route to fame ‘works’ can, in turn, produce more lethal events and foster one-upmanship among perpetrators.”
We’re learning. The No Notoriety Movement doesn’t ask America’s free press not to name the shooters. The movement asks the press to spend only as much time with these twisted fools as is absolutely necessary.

Resumen: One way for women to escape sexual assault or harassment is to get new jobs, even if they pay less. But noncompete clauses rob them of this leverage.

Texto completo: After decades of virtual silence, the #MeToo movement has publicized the epidemic of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The recent New York Times investigation of Sterling Jewelers exposes the depth of the problem and shows how long and hard women’s fight for justice remains. Since women who complain about harassment face retaliation and even termination, often the only way to escape it is to find a new job. Yet for many women, continuing their careers with a new employer turns out to be impossible.
That is because of noncomplete clauses. After they have resigned or even been fired, workers bound by noncompetes cannot accept employment in the same line of work or industry as their former employer for a specified period in a certain city, state or even the entire country. Nearly 30 million working people, including more than 12 million women, are locked into their jobs because of noncompete clauses.
Employers thus prevent their workers from leaving for employers offering higher wages, better benefits and dignity on the job. Incredibly, as a 2013 case in Florida shows, some employers even try to enforce noncompetes in court against workers who left after being subjected to alleged sexual harassment.
More: Iowa should ban tactics restricting employment opportunities for hourly workers
A federal agency has the power to put a stop to noncompetes. In March, the Open Markets Institute (where we both work), along with 19 labor and public interest organizations and 46 legal advocates and scholars, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to ban noncompetes under federal law. An FTC rule prohibiting noncompetes would help free women from abusive work environments.
Workers bound by a noncompete and looking to leave face three choices: 1) find a job in another line of work or industry, 2) move outside the geographic reach of the noncompete, or 3) accept unemployment for the duration of the noncompete.
Option 1 means accepting work outside one’s experience and skills. Option 2 means uprooting one’s family and severing social ties. Option 3 is possible only for the independently wealthy. As a practical matter, even when employers cannot or do not enforce them in court, noncompetes intimidate workers into staying with their employer.
Trapped to work as . . . a camp counselor?
Amazon warehouse workers, camp counselors, engineers, hair stylists, home health aides, investment managers, sandwich makers and yoga instructors are just some workers who have been bound by noncompete clauses. Amazon’s (now discontinued) noncompete with warehouse staff prohibited these workers from working at effectively any retailer in the entire world for 18 months after leaving Amazon.
The deprivation of exit is especially harmful to women who face a serious threat of sexual assault and harassment on the job. In an economy in which less than 10% of women belong to a union and at-will employment is the norm, women have little bargaining power and can be dismissed for practically any reason or no reason at all.
One of the few sources of leverage for women workers is to leave for employment elsewhere, even if it means a demotion or pay cut. A study by three sociology professors found that in a two-year period, women who were targets of sexual harassment were 6. 5 times more likely to change jobs than women who hadn’t been targeted.
Noncomplete clauses block the exits
By depriving them of outside employment opportunities, noncompetes lock victims of harassment into abusive environments. The stories of noncompetes being weaponized against women who are simply trying to escape harassment are shocking.
In Florida, for example, one employer had the nerve to sue a woman who had left her job because of sexual harassment to work for another company in her industry. According to the employee, her employer failed to stop the harassment and left her with no choice but to leave the hostile work environment. The employer then sued her for violating the noncompete clause in her employment contract, arguing that no Florida court has held that sexual harassment voids the contract. Ultimately, the court dismissed the case because the employer failed to provide evidence to support its claims. One wonders whether the lawsuit was yet another act of retaliation against the employee for daring to speak out.
While Congress can and should ban noncompetes through legislation, the FTC already has the power to outlaw noncompetes for all workers. The need for a decisive regulatory action is clear. And especially for women, the costs of inaction are too high.

Texto completo: As sunlight glistens off the smooth, stone surfaces of Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza on a recent warm afternoon, visitors meander about, some heading for a show while others, including the occasional child whirring by on a tiny scooter, glide along one of the great open spaces in New York.
What they all may not realize is that not too many feet away, the tip of a ceremonial shovel was pushed into the soil by President Dwight Eisenhower on May 14, 1959, forever changing the landscape and signaling the start of a new era for several acres of the Upper West Side.
With construction phases completed years ago - including a 2009 redesign of the popular Revson Fountain, the centerpiece of the plaza - many concertgoers, visitors and local residents might feel as if the expanse had always been here.
"The intent was that the plazas at Lincoln Center be great public spaces, akin to the piazzas and plazas in Italian and other European cities," said Andrew Scott Dolkart, professor of historic preservation at the Columbia University School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "The fact that the main plaza is open at one end and at all corners permits a dynamic flow of people, and the secondary plaza with the fountain also creates multiple streams of pedestrian traffic and seating. I think that these have been a great success and at many times of the day are among the most dynamic sites in New York."
The Lincoln Center of today, however, was born amid conceptual doubt and social consternation.
The project was the crown-jewel of then-Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr.'s Committee on Slum Clearance, which was overseen by master builder Robert Moses, according to a New York Times article from Dec. 2017.
The "urban renewal" plan, which included educational, commercial and residential facilities, ultimately resulted in the demolition of 18 Upper West Side blocks, according to the Times. Some 800 businesses and 7,000 families were displaced as a result of the project, and promised relocation assistance was never received by those most in need, including previous residents who were mostly black and Hispanic.
Along with the neighborhood, Lincoln Center itself has morphed over time.
"To me, one of the great losses in the city is Philip Johnson's original fountain in the center of the plaza, with its dancing water (which had been broken for many years before the entire piece was removed)," Dolkart said in an email.
He added that although the new fountain is dramatic, the water feature is "not in scale with the open space or buildings, and at the slightest breeze it makes the rim too wet to sit on. This is a big change since people always sat on the very comfortable Johnson rim."
"On the other hand, the sinking of the road at the front of the plaza has been a great improvement, making access more gracious (marred somewhat by the barrier blocks recently installed)," Dokart said. 
One need not spend more than a few moments on a sunny day - or for that matter even a cold, drizzly day - to see hundreds crisscrossing the plaza, sometimes hustling between the buildings, but often slowing down a little, maybe even stopping to look up at the towering Chagall murals just behind the Metropolitan Opera House front windows.
As one passes, it's impossible not to realize what is above the entire plaza: space, open space, certainly to be cherished for another 60 years.

U.S. News: Prosecutor to Examine Russia Probe Origins

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr has tapped the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut to study the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he has called "spying" on people affiliated with the Trump campaign, a person familiar with the decision said.
John Durham, Connecticut's U.S. attorney, is helping Mr. Barr look at the early stages of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe of the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia, which included surveillance and was later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr. Durham, who has experience investigating abuses by national-security officials, will help evaluate whether the government's intelligence-gathering efforts in the early stages of the probe were legal and appropriate, this person said.
His work marks the third ongoing investigation -- including one being conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general -- of law-enforcement actions in connection with the 2016 counterintelligence probe. President Trump's Republican allies have long alleged that his associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance, and that investigators in the Justice Department and the FBI were politically prejudiced against Mr. Trump in a way that could have affected their work. FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials have defended the bureau's work.
Other details of Mr. Barr's review are scarce. The Justice Department didn't comment. Mr. Durham's involvement in the matter was first reported by the New York Times.
Mr. Durham was nominated by Mr. Trump in 2017 after a long career as a federal prosecutor in both Republican and Democratic administrations.
Mr. Barr stirred criticism when he said last month that he would be forming a team of officials to examine the origins of the Russia probe, using language that Democrats said was politically motivated and echoed Mr. Trump's own criticism of the investigation. "Spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated," Mr. Barr said.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Justice Department's inspector general, close to concluding its inquiry, is homing in on whether the agency continued surveillance of one associate, former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, despite questions about a key source's credibility, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lindsey Graham: Trump Jr. should invoke the Fifth before Senate Intelligence

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr.’s lawyer would “have to be an idiot” to permit the president’s eldest son to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee again, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Monday.
Graham said Trump Jr. should comply with the panel's subpoena but encouraged him to skirt questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.
“You just show up and plead the Fifth and it’s over with,” the Senate Judiciary chairman told reporters.
“This whole thing is nuts,” Graham said. “To me, it’s over.”
The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Trump Jr. last week for additional testimony as it wraps up its investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump Jr. has already given approximately 30 hours of testimony to lawmakers on matters related to Russia.
Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., has told colleagues in private that he resorted to a subpoena after Trump Jr. twice agreed to sit down for another interview, but then backed out, according to the New York Times.
Graham isn't alone in suggesting Trump Jr. defy Burr's subpoena. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., another ally of President Trump, said on Sunday another interview with Trump Jr. "can only lead to mischief."
The subpoena came soon after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declared "case closed" after special counsel Robert Mueller was unable to find sufficient evidence of criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The president has said he is "surprised" the intelligence panel subpoenaed his son, and Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., without going into specifics, said, "the committee has been very clear with every one that we reserve the right to bring witnesses back if we have additional questions or there’s inconsistencies."

Texto completo: While final exams are still underway for some college students, others are lucky enough to have been already donning their caps and gowns at commencement ceremonies.
The Class of 2019 can expect an array of speakers to send them off — from politicians to business leaders to superstar athletes. Whether it's a motivating anecdote or a lecture to lull the guests to sleep, commencement speakers utter the final words of wisdom a graduate hears before getting that degree.
Here's a list of commencement speakers at colleges and university throughout New Jersey and the lower Hudson Valley:
Monmouth University Carolyn Porco, an award-winning planetary scientist, will deliver the address at the undergraduate commencement on May 15 at the PNC Bank Arts Center.
William Paterson University Jonathan Alter, an award-winning author, columnist and political analyst, will give the speech at the undergraduate ceremony on May 15 at the Prudential Center.
Ramapo College Former New York Giants player Tiki Barber will give the speech on May 17 at Prudential Center.
Manhattan College Justice Sonia Sotomayor will give the speech on May 17.
Rutgers-New Brunswick Devon and Jason McCourty, alumni twins who play with the New England Patriots and won this year's Super Bowl, will give the speech together on May 19 at HighPoint.com stadium.
Seton Hall University Bob Ley, an alumnus with a 40-year career at ESPN, will give the speech on May 20 at the Prudential Center.
St. Peter's University Yvette Noel-Schure, co-founder and executive vice president of Schure Media Group and longtime publicist for Beyoncé, will give the address on May 20 at PNC Bank Arts Center.
New Jersey Institute of Technology Gov. Phil Murphy will give the speech on May 21 at Prudential Center.
Rutgers-Newark Dorothy Roberts, a social justice advocate and scholar, will give the speech on May 22 at Prudential Center.
Rutgers-Camden Dr. Patrick Harker, CEO of Federal Reserve Bank, will give the speech on May 22 at the BB&T Pavilion.

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations - for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early - as in, right now - to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday (punctuation and ALL CAPS his), "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump and Falwell's tweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave - especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races" motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.

In Carter's rise, a story for our time; Amid packed field, a peanut farmer became president

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As the primaries approached, one Democrat after another announced campaigns for president. Most were senators. Some were governors. One came from a university town in Indiana. They spoke of a need to clean up an executive branch they said was riddled with corruption.
No, this isn't a description of the 2020 campaign. It was 1976 - the most crowded Democratic presidential field in modern American history, until the current election cycle, which boasts 21.
And, despite worries about a bruising intraparty battle, the little-known peanut farmer who won the primaries also won the White House. His name was Jimmy Carter.
How many Democratic candidates were there in 1976? One historian put the number at 17, though it depends on how you count them. Let's just say the race was remarkably fluid right up until to the last primary.
The first to announce was Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona in late November of 1974, almost a full two years before the election. The longtime congressman came from a famous political dynasty. (Four generations of Udalls have served in various elected offices across the American West.)
The next was Carter, who was weeks away from finishing his term as Georgia governor. He was so unknown that a Gallup poll that asked voters for their impressions of 31 possible candidates didn't even have Carter on the list.
But Carter had a few things going for him.
First, he had visited nearly three dozen states that year in his Democratic Party role coordinating the midterm elections, developing "a reputation as a tactician and an organizer," The New York Times wrote.
Second, he guessed correctly that in the first presidential election since President Richard Nixon's resignation, voters would be looking for an outsider to reform Washington. Even with Nixon gone, resentment toward the president who'd pardoned him, Gerald Ford, was high.
"People are disillusioned with officials in Washington. They are looking for a new face, a new leader whose ideas work," Carter wrote in his first fundraising letter.
Which brings us to one more thing in Carter's favor. After 1968, changes to the nomination process meant party bosses no longer picked a candidate at the convention; instead, primaries and caucuses became the key decider. And crucially, Iowa had moved its caucus to front of the calendar. Carter planned to compete in every primary - a rare move at the time - and focused his energy on winning Iowa to build early momentum.
When political veteran Sen. Henry "Scoop" Jackson of Washington, regarded by some as the front-runner, announced his candidacy a few months later, he told reporters he didn't plan to travel much and would campaign from the Senate. And he didn't enter all of the primaries.
The same went for Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Birch Bayh of Indiana, and former senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma, who all announced in early 1975. They didn't sign up for all the primaries, though Bayh, like Carter, decided to campaign hard in Iowa.
Then the floodgates opened: Former North Carolina Gov. Terry Sanford; diplomat Sargent Shriver; Pennsylvania. Gov. Milton Shapp; Alabama Gov. George Wallace; and anti-abortion "housewife" Ellen McCormack all got into the race. By the end of 1975, 10 candidates had announced.
Though Wallace wasn't expected to win, he had "perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the electorate," The Washington Post reported, meaning he could end up being a power broker at the convention if no candidate had won a majority of the delegates by then.
There were also a handful of "favorite son" candidates, including District of Columbia Mayor Walter Washington and West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd. Favorite son was a time-honored tactic whereby a popular state leader would run in the primary in their home state only - not to win the presidency, but to negotiate concessions from candidates in exchange for the favorite son's delegates. By 1976, this maneuver was essentially obsolete, though few realized it yet.
And even on the eve of the Iowa caucus, more candidates loomed. Idaho Sen. Frank Church believed himself to be the front-runner, Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer wrote in Politico, but he figured he would wait until some of the candidates destroyed each other before entering the race unscathed.
In January of 1976, Carter got what he wanted in Iowa - sort of. He beat his rivals, but "uncommitted" got the most votes. Still, he was showered with media attention heading into New Hampshire. A month later, he won New Hampshire, with Udall coming in second and Bayh in third.
The momentum was short-lived. On March 2, Jackson won delegate-rich Massachusetts. Carter came in fourth after Udall and Wallace.
There were further setbacks. At a televised presidential forum, The Washington Post described Carter's performance as "calculated evasiveness."
Jackson attacked, saying, "In Iowa, he promises to abolish legalized abortion. In New York, he promises to oppose a constitutional amendment for such change."
Then, when asked by the New York Daily News if public housing should be scattered throughout metropolitan areas, Carter responded, "I see nothing wrong with ethnic purity being maintained." The Congressional Black Caucus complained, and Carter apologized, saying he meant he wouldn't, by government fiat, change a neighborhood's "ethnic character."
Church finally entered the race in mid-March, subsequently winning in Nebraska, Oregon and other Western states.
Then, in a surprise move, California Gov. Jerry Brown announced he would run, just so he could block Jackson from winning in California. He picked up Maryland on the way.
In April, Jackson lost Pennsylvania to Carter and suspended his campaign.
It all came down to the last primaries on June 8: Ohio, New Jersey and California. Carter ignored the latter two, putting everything on Ohio. He won.
Then, according to Zelizer, he got a call from Wallace, offering him his delegates. Wary of the appearance of accepting a gift from the racist Wallace, Carter called Jackson, who agreed to release his delegates to Carter too.
Carter had clinched the nomination, only a month before the convention in New York.
"Everything fell into place so quickly for Carter," The Washington Post reported, "that it was hard to remember how long and how hard he had labored to make that moment inevitable."

Baby Archie, Britain's newest royal, has already taught us an important lesson about race

Texto completo: Danny Baker was a highly successful and even "brilliant" British radio host in the eyes of his BBC bosses, until he tweeted a photo that wasn't as innocently cute as he thought it was.
The photo depicted a young man and woman holding hands with a chimpanzee over a caption that read: "Royal baby leaves hospital."
His bosses, among many others, were not amused by his intemperate salute to newborn Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, son of Prince Harry and his biracial American wife, Meghan Markle. He deleted the tweet and apologized, saying he had not considered the picture's racist connotations. Too late. He was fired later the same day.
Too bad. Baker's blunder illustrates the hidden impact of the new royal baby's arrival: He offers us commoners another opportunity to embarrass ourselves through our ignorance, not only about royalty but also about race.
I call such racial gaffes the downside of trying "not to see color." That's a well-meaning impulse when it leads us to treat others fairly, regardless of their race or ethnicity. But attempts to impose a false invisibility on important issues like race, gender and ethnicity can blind us to aspects of other people that we should be trying to see.
Baker should have gotten a clue from the very fact that Harry and Meghan's nuptials in May 2018 drew more global attention and, I would argue, caused more excitement than any other since Prince Charles and Princess Diana tied the knot in 1981.
Amid the current storms over trade wars, real wars, Brexit and border security debates, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and baby Archie offer us, at least, a lovely symbolic vision of peace and love across racial and international lines.
For the black diaspora, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, Archie's parents and his birth have stirred an excitement mixed with questions. One appeared in the headline to an op-ed by Carla Hall, a Los Angeles Times editorial writer who also is biracial: "Will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry raise their baby to be black?"
Hall's essay, which was more nuanced than its headline, provoked a wide array of responses from trolls as well as sensible people. After all, even unabashed social justice warriors should hesitate before considering a member of the British royal family to be oppressed, just because he has a mixed-race mom. Living while royal most likely will mean more to baby Archie's identity development than living while black.
We don't even know yet how much his black genes will affect how he looks. As much as we in the U.S. are conditioned by the "one-drop rule," a distinctly American idea that one drop of "black blood" in your ancestry makes you black, baby Archie could be part black but look quite white.
Racial identity is expressed in two ways: How we see ourselves and what others see when they look at us. Archie may grow into skin color and hair texture that looks white enough for others to presume that's all that matters.
Yet as Baker's misadventure illustrates, how a child sees himself or herself can be challenged on an almost daily basis by a world that only wants to see one racial or cultural heritage at a time, often through the distorting lenses of stereotypes.
Writer Lizzie Skurnick, daughter of a black mother and white Jewish father, asked a question in a New York Times essay that is similar to Hall's: "Will he have kinky hair?" Either way, she notes, she'll love #BabySussex, as his parents hashtagged their son on Instagram, and hopes he'll be as proud of his kinky hair as she is proud of hers.
That's important, as mixed-race Americans have become a growing category of Americans, for children and teens who inevitably have questions about themselves, their background, their heritage and how to put up with sometimes annoying "What are you?" questions from their peers.
For this, Harry and Meghan offered a good model in their choices of wedding speakers and music from Meghan's cultural heritage. Chicago-born Bishop Michael Curry, the first African American to head the Episcopal Church in the U.S., delivered a spirited sermon. A gospel choir sang, breaking from Church of England tradition and breaking into a lively version of Ben E. King's 1961 hit "Stand By Me."
I'm sure I was not the only African American in the global audience who was reminded in that service of the cultural experience my parents gave me, not only to appreciate where I was coming from but also to prepare me for the larger world into which I hoped to grow. I wish no less for baby Archie, whichever way his privileged life takes him.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers have reached an agreement with Frank Vogel to be their head coach, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
The Lakers are also hiring Jason Kidd, the Hall of Fame point guard who has coached the Nets and the Milwaukee Bucks, as an assistant, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the moves publicly.
Both deals materialized Saturday and come one month after the Lakers parted ways with Luke Walton; three days after talks broke down with Tyronn Lue, their top choice; and just over 24 hours after a small group of fans gathered outside of Staples Center and protested the franchise's recent instability.
The agreements with Vogel and Kidd were first reported by ESPN.
Vogel, 45, did not coach this season, but he had a two-season run as head coach of the Orlando Magic from 2016 to 2018 after a successful six-season tenure as coach of the Indiana Pacers. With the Lakers, Vogel will face immediate pressure to help restore an N.B.A. flagship franchise that has fallen into relative disrepair despite the addition of LeBron James last summer.
As The New York Times reported Wednesday, Lue had agreed to the Lakers' insistence that Vogel be an assistant coach before negotiations ended. Vogel then emerged as an immediate candidate for the top post and has strong support within the Lakers' organization from Kurt Rambis, the former Lakers player and coach who serves as an adviser to the owner Jeanie Buss.
Vogel was a finalist for the Knicks' head coaching post in 2016 that went to Jeff Hornacek when Phil Jackson, the former Lakers coach, was the Knicks' team president -- with Rambis working under Jackson.
The Lakers (37-45) are playoff spectators for the sixth straight season, the longest drought in franchise history. James, 34, who scuffled through one of his most disappointing and injury-marred seasons, has three years left on a nine-figure contract, and the clock is ticking on the front office to maximize whatever time he has left as one of the league's elite.
The Lakers' season was punctuated by the departures of Walton (which was expected) and Magic Johnson, the team's president of basketball operations (which was not). Their sudden absences have made James the most visible presence for a franchise that cannot seem to find its footing under Buss.
The protracted coaching search also appeared to reveal that the team is unwilling to completely cater to James.
In Cleveland, Lue coached James to three straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals and helped guide the 2016 team to the franchise's first championship. But Lue could not agree on terms with the Lakers, who had insisted on having final say over Lue's assistant coaches, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. At least two advisers close to Buss raised concerns to her that reuniting Lue with James would give James too much power, according to the people.
ESPN reported that Vogel accepted the same contract length -- three seasons -- that prompted Lue to stop negotiations.
Vogel becomes the Lakers' fifth head coach -- sixth if you count Bernie Bickerstaff, who coached five games on an interim basis in 2012 -- since Jackson stepped down in 2011. The coaching carousel has only added to the growing chaos around the Lakers despite a core of promising young players that includes Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram.
In Indiana, Vogel coached the Pacers to five postseason appearances and two trips to the Eastern Conference finals. After the Pacers lost in the first round of the 2016 playoffs, his contract was not renewed. He left for Orlando, where he was fired after two losing seasons.
The big question now is whether Vogel can reestablish some cohesion among a group of players unsettled by this season's failed attempts to trade for the New Orleans Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis. All eyes will be on James, too, to see whether he buys into the new staff's message.
The James factor surely helps explain hiring Kidd, who is known to command James's respect. They have been close friends since they were teammates at the 2008 Olympics.
Kidd, who interviewed for the Lakers' head coaching job alongside Lue, Monty Williams and Juwan Howard, instantly becomes one of the league's most high-profile assistants.
A 10-time All-Star who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018, Kidd has four-and-a-half seasons of head coaching experience, most recently with the Bucks before he was fired last season.

Texto completo: When a hard rain descends on New York, the whole city feels it. Traffic stands still, puddles get deceptively deep and even the most intrepid of us cowers in the wakes of passing cabs. Any object an unsuspecting pedestrian is carrying quickly becomes a makeshift umbrella, and actual umbrellas quickly become hazards themselves, catching the wind or flipping inside out.
Until recently, whenever news was slow, The New York Times sent photographers out to take "day shots" -- slice-of-life images arresting enough to carry the front page. Weather, and people dealing with it, often made great subjects. "When it rains, it's a whole different scene," said Bill Cunningham, the renowned Times staff photographer, in the 2010 documentary "Bill Cunningham New York." He explained: "Things happen. People forget about you. If they see you, they don't go putting on airs. They're the way they are."
The best of these photos make you feel caught in a downpour yourself. All they need to make you feel truly soaked, though, is sound. So we asked Craig Henighan, a sound artist who has created and mixed sound for projects like "Stranger Things," "Roma" and "Noah" -- a rain movie if there ever was one -- to create short soundtracks for the images.
"What I ended up finding on 'Noah' was that rain, like water and drips, needed to react to something," Mr. Henighan said. "It needed to hit a surface, or it needed to hit a certain thing a certain way to give me different textures of rain."
When he looked at The Times's images, he heard a soundtrack in his head: Chevys and Fords with V8 engines. Distant sirens. The footsteps of people walking by. And the whipping wind. "A sound person has to be aware of the different eras, and where they are geographically in the world," he said. In New York City, you hear not just the rain hitting the street but rain hitting marble, granite, cars and umbrellas.
To create these soundscapes, Mr. Henighan layered and mixed tracks of rain, wind and city sounds. He elaborated in an email: "I added some reverb and slap echo to mimic how sounds react on a city block. I would equalize each sound to make them feel a little more retro and match the black and white of the photos. I also did some panning through the stereo field to give movement, to replicate what real life is like in New York with things constantly coming at you."
Because the past is often studied through photographs, text and other visual documentation, we tend to underplay the other four senses. The historian and MacArthur "Genius" grant recipient Emily Thompson studies and writes about sonic cultures of the past. She explained in an email: "Visual records like photographs identify different sources of sound present in the environment, such as animals, vehicles, tools, musical instruments or alarm devices. But while the visual content is neatly bounded by the four sides of a photograph's frame, sound is less well-behaved. It doesn't respect boundaries much at all. So a photograph of a city street scene will reveal clues to many of the sounds heard by the people on that street at the moment that photo was taken. But the sounds that dominated the scene might have been located just out of frame -- a fire truck approaching from down the block, for example."
One record of what rain in the city sounded like in the late 1960s and 1970s can be found in the work of Irving Teibel. Mr. Teibel was not your typical field recordist: He was less interested in documenting sound as faithfully as possible than he was in its psychological properties, often splicing together and manipulating recordings for particular effects.
"He treated magnetic tapes as a medium, the way that a painter would treat watercolor or oil paint," said Jessica Wood, an assistant curator of the Music and Recorded Sound Division at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. "He liberated recorded sound from just being secondary to whatever it's recording and elevated recorded sound to being an art form in and of itself."
Mr. Teibel's archive is currently being digitized at the New York Public Library. Ms. Wood shared a rarely heard May 1970 recording -- one of Mr. Teibel's more unvarnished -- which captures a rainstorm in Chinatown, so we could pair it with a photograph from the same neighborhood and time period.
You see the scene but also hear the clamor of the street. The pairing conveys a sense of time and place, aural and visual, a reminder that like the rain, we too are a passing part of the landscape.

The Perks of Being a Real Estate Mogul

Texto completo: Donald Trump reported more than $ 1 billion in real estate losses on his tax returns from 1985 to 1994, The New York Times revealed this week. Those losses allowed him to avoid paying any income tax for eight of the 10 years that were reviewed.
The Times investigation offered a detailed portrait of Mr. Trump's financial failures over a decade. It also showed the extent of the special treatment the tax code allows for real estate investments.
A portion of Mr. Trump's losses were related to depreciation, a tax strategy that he, and others in commercial real estate, can use to write down the cost of their buildings over a number of years.
Depreciation is just the start for real estate moguls.
Favorable treatment for commercial real estate occurs at multiple levels, including income and property taxes as well as more complicated structures that allow savvy families to pass real estate worth hundreds of millions to heirs tax-free. There are myriad benefits, all legal, created specifically for commercial real estate.
In the 2017 tax overhaul, the deductions for real estate taxes and mortgage interest on a home were severely curtailed. Not so for commercial real estate. The taxes a property incurs are fully deductible as a business expense.
The overhaul also allowed real estate companies to take a special deduction for qualified business income meant as an incentive for companies with a large number of employees. During the tax bill's negotiations in Congress, an exemption was added for real estate. Instead of considering employees for the deduction, real estate companies could use a different calculation based on their assets.
That favorable treatment comes on top of existing tax breaks. The biggest additional benefits are depreciation and a tax structure called a like-kind exchange, also known as a 1031 exchange. Both are billed as tax-deferral strategies, but in many cases, those taxes are never paid.
The concept of depreciation refers to the loss of value of everything in a real estate investment, from the furniture in the lobby to the building itself. The rate at which these assets depreciate varies. For personal effects, like couches and dishwashers, their value hits zero after five to seven years.
For buildings, the useful life is determined by what kind of property it is. It's 27.5 years for multifamily residential buildings and 39 years for commercial property, like an industrial park. At the end of that time, the building would be worth zero, from a tax perspective, and the owner would have received the loss of that value in increments year after year.
Mr. Trump proclaimed in a 2016 presidential debate: "I love depreciation." And that phrase could be a motto for real estate investors in general.
When a property is sold, the seller would in theory owe tax on the difference between the depreciated value and the sale price. This is known as depreciation recapture, and it's the point where the deferred taxes are supposed to be paid.
Some real estate investors see a benefit in selling a property and paying the tax on the gain.
Timothy Wallen, chief executive of MLG Capital, a series of real estate funds that manage $ 1.73 billion in 95 commercial real estate buildings, said selling buildings and paying taxes allowed them to make new investments that would generate higher returns.
"Our belief is, we can buy more stuff and offset any tax burdens," he said. "There's an opportunity cost to buy and hold."
Other times, though, the seller -- particularly when it is an individual or a family, and not a fund investing other people's money -- can put the property into a like-kind exchange.
This tax structure allows the owner to sell one property and put that money into another property within six months. If the transaction is done properly, the property owner doesn't pay any taxes on the gain from the sale of the original building. This tax benefit is given to investors who put their money into commercial and residential real estate, but it is not available to homeowners.
These like-kind exchanges used to be open to all kinds of assets, including art and classic cars. But in the 2017 tax act, they were restricted to just one: commercial real estate. Within that asset class, though, the types of properties that can be exchanged can vary. A storage facility could be swapped for a hotel, for example, or the air rights over an office tower could be turned into a mall.
The tax code is written so that the accumulated capital gains taxes are eventually supposed to be paid. But when an individual owns the real estate, the properties can be held until death. At that point, all of the embedded capital gains are wiped out, so no capital gains tax is owed. The family inherits the properties at whatever value they were appraised at on the date of death.
Along the way, though, the owner could have refinanced the building and taken the cash out. It's known in real estate parlance as "the harvest," and as long as the building's cash flow is enough to cover the debt payments, the money is tax-free, said Kevin D. Gray, a lecturer in real estate at the Yale School of Management and the Yale School of Architecture.
Death and taxes are unavoidable, but real estate investors can circumvent the second part by using estate planning to significantly lower, if not eliminate, taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars of property at death.
The estate tax exemption for a married couple is $ 22.8 million, so generous that only a sliver of the wealthiest of the wealthy will need to worry about it. But commercial real estate is generally owned through a partnership or limited liability company, in which there is no tax at the corporate level and all the gains and losses flow through to the individual. They have a built-in advantage allowing owners to transfer exponentially more to heirs free of taxes.
Consider a building worth $ 30 million. If the owner puts it into a trust for his heirs, he can discount the value by a third or more because a fractional stake in the partnership that owns the building is worth less because it lacks control and marketability, according to the Internal Revenue Code. The buyer is likely to be just another family member.
That 30 percent discount, or $ 10 million, on the real estate is a benefit that someone with $ 30 million of Google stock does not get, but there's more, said Justin Miller, national wealth strategist at BNY Mellon. At a conservative 7 percent growth rate, the building could be worth $ 120 million, when other deductions are considered, in 20 years' time, he said.
The owner could then swap the building for $ 120 million of stock, making it easier for his heirs to divide. The building would be valued at its original price for capital gains taxes, but when the owner died, all of those taxable gains would die with him. Or, Mr. Miller said, the owner could take a $ 120 million loan, and the loan and the building would cancel each out at death, resulting in no estate tax.
The ways real estate gets preferential treatment are dizzying. But Mr. Miller said one thing was clear: In the debate over economic fairness, these tax breaks have flown under the radar.
"I don't think people realize how much is being taken advantage of here," he said. "It's not just for taxpayers now. It's for their heirs -- you're almost allowing the creation of a royal class of families."
None of these tax benefits work, of course, if the real estate investment is not sound.
"There are the tax benefits that go along with the investment," said T. Richard Litton Jr., president of Harbor Group International, which owns $ 8.2 billion of real estate. "Fundamentally, on the investment decision, the thesis should always be, how can you grow income like any business you buy?"
In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Trump's tax losses had consequences. During the 10 years examined in the Times report, three of his New Jersey casinos and New York's famed Plaza Hotel filed for bankruptcy.
"It's one thing to shelter your income and not have real losses," said Mr. Gray of Yale. "If you lose money, you lose money. But if you lose enough of it, you're going to lose the property."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Officially, it's the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, a blacktie extravaganza held in May to raise money for the Costume Institute (aka, the fashion department).
Unofficially, the night's festivities have been called many things, including "the party of the year," "the Oscars of the East Coast" (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, where guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum).
The party signals the opening of the Costume Institute's annual blockbuster show, and it is known for its celebrity and fashion hosts. This year the exhibition is "Camp: Notes on Fashion," a play on the famous Susan Sontag essay "Notes on Camp."
The hosts are "Vogue" editor Anna Wintour, Alessandro Michele, creative director of Gucci; Harry Styles, the pop star who flouts gender stereotype (and muse of Michele); and Lady Gaga, who needs no explanation.
Also tennis star Serena Williams; for reasons that are not entirely clear in the context of the exhibition's theme - her tennis tutu? - except that Wintour is a famous tennis fan, and hey, she's Serena. Wouldn't you want to go to a party she was hosting?
Q: Wait, isn't camp a place where kids go in the summer to learn canoeing life skills? What does that have to do with fashion?
A: That's the first definition in Merriam-Webster. Read on down to definition No. 2: "a style or mode of personal or creative expression that is absurdly exaggerated and often fuses elements of high and popular culture." And this can be best seen in... clothes!
That said, camp is an awfully slippery concept to pin down. One person's camp is another person's kitsch is another person's tongue in chic.
Of course, the gala itself is, in many ways, the apotheosis of camp, because attendees are encouraged to dress in theme.
Q: Do you mean this is a costume party?
A: Not exactly - but almost. It isn't stated that attendees have to dress in the style of the exhibition, but it is encouraged. Just as it isn't stated that, if celebrities are invited to the gala by a brand, they have to wear clothes from that brand, but it's really part of the deal.
This encourages said brands to get the best stars, because they can act as an advertisement for a house. It is also why, whenever designers are photographed on the red carpet, their dates are almost always famous people.
In 2016, the show was "Manus ex Machina," which meant almost the entire Jenner-Kardashian clan was in sparkling Balmain motherboards. In 2017, for the Rei Kawakubo exhibition, Helen Lasichanh, wife of Pharrell William's, gamely entered into the spirit of the evening in a red Comme des Garçons jumpsuit that flattened and haloed the body but had no armholes, meaning the eating thing became a little complicated.
Last year, for the celebration of "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination," things got really extreme. Rihanna came as the pope. And Sarah Jessica Parker had an entire nativity scene on her head.
Q: That does sound insanely camp.
A: It is. The Met Gala is always full of artifice, exaggeration, theatricality and - to quote Sontag - "failed seriousness." Which does raise the question: Is it even possible to get any more camp, or will the whole thing simply tip over into absurdity?
Q: OK, what if I want to go?
A: Good luck. Unlike other cultural fundraisers, like the New York City Ballet gala or the Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball, the Met Gala is invitation only, and there is a waiting list.
Qualifications for inclusion have to do with buzz and achievement (and beauty), aka, the gospel according to Anna, more than money. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee, which means that even if a company buys a table, it cannot choose everyone who sits at its table: It must clear the guest with her and Vogue and pray for approval.
Q: Who does get to go?
A: This year, about 550 "Chosen Ones." In the past the guest list has been a guarded secret, but this year for the first time - Vogue released the names early.
Q: How much does the gala cost?
A: Tickets are $35,000 apiece, and tables range from $200,000 to $300,000. All the money from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute, which is necessary because it is the only one of the Met's curatorial departments that has to fund itself.
Q: What happens when guests get inside?
A: It's another secret. For the last three years, posting on social media has been banned after the red carpet.
Guests file by, air kiss Wintour and Co., and then tour the exhibition on their way to the cocktail party, so they are theoretically forced to experience some culture.
After cocktails, they are called in to dinner, and there is always some form of entertainment.
Q: So why does it matter?
A: It's reality TV at its most glamorous; the All-Star Game of Entrances.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Rep. Richard Neal issued subpoenas Friday to the Treasury secretary and IRS chief seeking six years of President Trump's tax returns and audit records, taking the next formal step in the dispute between House Democrats and the Treasury Department.
Democrats don't expect Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or Charles Rettig, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, to comply with the subpoenas, following Mr. Mnuchin's rejection of a previous written request from Mr. Neal and following the administration's general refusal to provide documents for House Democrats' investigations. The subpoenas, issued on the advice of House lawyers, link the tax-return fight to the existing body of law governing congressional information requests.
"While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material," Mr. Neal said.
Treasury and IRS officials said Friday they had received the subpoenas.

Mr. Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, requested the tax records last month, using a power the tax code gives him as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Under that provision, which dates to the aftermath of the Teapot Dome scandal in 1924, the chairman can seek any taxpayer's returns and the Treasury secretary "shall furnish" them.
The law is clear, but Mr. Mnuchin argued in a letter on Monday that Mr. Neal's request exceeded Congress's constitutional authority because it lacked a legitimate legislative purpose. Mr. Mnuchin wrote that the Justice Department would publish a more detailed legal opinion, though that hasn't happened yet.
Although the tax-code provision requires Mr. Mnuchin to produce any requested documents, it doesn't outline deadlines or penalties for noncompliance. The subpoenas, which set a May 17 deadline, could help address those issues because courts may treat that deadline like they would treat that of any other congressional subpoena.
Mr. Neal also responded to an argument Mr. Mnuchin has made. The secretary has argued that limiting the request to Mr. Trump showed that Democrats weren't really interested in how the IRS was auditing presidential tax returns.
Mr. Trump's extensive business holdings and claims about audits make him different, Mr. Neal wrote in letters accompanying the subpoenas .
"The tax issues raised by the current president are unique," he wrote.
Mr. Neal, who became Ways and Means chairman in January, has been saying for months that he expected the tax-returns fight to end up in court. It is now likely headed there and could take months, at least, to resolve.
Democrats have been pressing Mr. Trump to release his tax returns since the 2016 presidential campaign, when he broke a four-decade tradition of voluntary disclosure. Mr. Trump has cited IRS audits as a reason to keep his returns private, though no law stops him from releasing them.
Mr. Neal used those audits as the purpose of his request, arguing that the committee needs to examine how well the IRS is auditing the president who oversees it. The request covers some years before Mr. Trump became president, which may have been under audit. It also covers the two years he has been president, because all presidential tax returns are audited. The request also includes business tax returns that may be outside the scope of the automatic audit.
Mr. Mnuchin and Republican lawmakers have argued this audit-oversight rationale is just a pretext for a political fishing expedition. They have noted that Mr. Neal isn't seeking previous presidents' audit records and pointed to other Democrats' statements about their desire to see Mr. Trump's tax returns.
Democrats have cited multiple reasons why they want to see Mr. Trump's tax returns, including the possibility that the returns would reveal conflicts of interest and financial ties. If it ever receives the returns, the committee could review them only in closed session but could release the documents or information with a vote.
Mr. Trump's comments this week added fuel to Democrats' interest in his tax records. After a New York Times report detailed more than $1 billion in tax losses that he compiled from 1985 through 1994, the president declared that he was engaged in a form of competition or entertainment.
"You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport," he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
Tax records from that time period aren't directly relevant to Mr. Neal's request for more recent documents. Still, Democrats said they worried the president's approach to tax avoidance could undermine the voluntary compliance that underpins the tax system.
"What words for the president of the United States, when we want public confidence in the tax system, to declare it sport, to underreport, to dodge your taxes," Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D., Texas) said at a committee hearing on Thursday.
Republicans defended Mr. Trump and warned that Mr. Neal's request would set a precedent.
"This is a gross abuse of authority, and I'm embarrassed this committee would do that," said Rep. Tom Rice (R., S.C.).

Texto completo: And the next coach of the Los Angeles Lakers is ...
Anyone?
Anyone?
After talks reportedly dissolved between the Lakers and Tyronn Lue on Wednesday, former Orlando Magic coach Frank Vogel is now under consideration for the vacancy, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Lakers plan to interview Vogel Thursday.
Vogel, 45, led the Magic to a combined 54-110 record (.329) during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons. He previously coached the Indiana Pacers for 5 1/2 seasons and has a career NBA regular-season record of 304-291 (.511).
Besides Vogel, the Times reported the Lakers now are pondering Mike Woodson and Lionel Hollins, both of whom also have previous NBA head-coaching experience, in their quest to replace Luke Walton. Jason Kidd and Miami Heat assistant Juwan Howard remain in contention for one of the league's marquee coaching jobs, the Times reported.
The Lakers and Walton mutually agreed to part ways after LeBron James' first season in Los Angeles, during which the team finished 37-45 and missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. After his departure, Walton was hired to coach the Sacramento Kings but is the subject of a lawsuit alleging he sexually assault a woman, clouding his future.
One of the sticking points between Lue, who led James and the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA title in 2016, was whether he would get to choose his coaching staff, the Times reported. According to the New York Times, Lue wanted to bring Vogel aboard as his top assistant, while the Lakers preferred he work with Kidd in that role.
The Magic replaced Vogel with Steve Clifford, who led Orlando to the playoffs in his first season at the helm. The Magic were eliminated by the Toronto Raptors in five games, but they reached the postseason for the first time since the 2011-12 season.

The Trump 'brand': Debt and hot air

Texto completo: Candidate Donald Trump's biggest selling point was that he was supposedly a successful self-made entrepreneur who would use his private-sector know-how to "run government like a business."
Many of us scoffed. After all, even if you believed he was a successful businessman - one who hadn't, ahem, lost a billion dollars - managing a private company is nothing like helming a government.
But in retrospect, we doubters were wrong. Trump's business practices turn out to have told us a lot about how he would serve as president, and not only because in both settings he surrounded himself with sycophants and family members. In fact, many of the practices that benefited him as a private businessman seem to be serving Trump himself - if not exactly the country - quite well as president.
At least in the near term, anyway.
On Monday, for instance, the Trump administration declared it would not provide the president's tax documents to the House Ways and Means Committee, despite a nearly century-old law explicitly stating that the treasury secretary "shall furnish" any tax documents that this committee's chair requests. House Democrats are deciding whether to challenge this decision (as well as other administration stonewalling) in court, a process that could drag on for months, if not years.
Nothing about this should surprise. The administration's strategy here echoes Trump's entire private-sector career.
To Trump, clearly, the law is merely an opening offer in any negotiation, in response to which he assembles an army of lawyers and uses the threat of exhausting and expensive litigation to pressure the other side to cede ground. He's shown this in his 100-plus disputes over his tax obligations, as well as hundreds of other lawsuits over his reneging on legally binding contracts.
Or - speaking of tax disclosures - consider some of the findings in the New York Times's recent blockbuster report on Trump's tax records.
The reporters explain how in the late 1980s, Trump made millions in the stock market by borrowing money to buy shares in a company, publicly suggesting he was about to take over that company, and then quietly selling on the resulting rally. Eventually, however, other investors began to recognize that these takeover claims were a ruse. In 1990, the Times found, he lost $35 million on short-term trades, equivalent to about half of what he gained in such transactions over the previous four years.
One might argue that, as president, Trump has attempted a similar pump-and-dump-style scheme involving the overall economy.
After all, Trump has borrowed $2 trillion to pump the economy with a short-term tax-cut-and-spending-hike fiscal stimulus. He's counting on that stimulus to get him through the next election. He does not appear to realize that even if his scheme works, at some point the impact of the stimulus will fade, the economy will turn, and the government will have no credible ammunition left.
Maybe he's assuming he'll be gone by then. Or maybe the threat of a downturn on his watch explains why he's already begun applying another strategy that served him well in the private sector: When the numbers aren't in your favor, simply invent new numbers.
As a private businessman, when Trump's net worth wasn't as high as he wanted, he changed the formula for calculating his net worth. Specifically, he plucked, seemingly out of thin air, a suspiciously round and dubiously large additional asset to add to his balance sheet: his "brand value." According to a financial statement that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen gave Congress, and that Cohen said was provided to private lenders and Forbes magazine, Trump assessed the value of his "brand" at $4 billion - nearly half his newly inflated net worth.
The Trump administration has developed a similar strategy on the economy.
This week, the administration proposed a change to how the government sets the official poverty line. That line, for those unfamiliar, is an income threshold that determines eligibility cut-offs for various safety-net programs, such as food stamps, housing assistance and Medicaid.
The administration has proposed changing the formula used to adjust the poverty threshold for inflation each year so that the income cutoff rises more slowly. Over time, this would reduce the number of people who count as "poor" and who are therefore eligible to receive Medicaid or food stamps - not because their living standards have actually improved but because the administration has arbitrarily altered its math.
Just as then-private-businessman Trump tried to redefine how we measure his wealth, now-president Trump is working to redefine how we measure others' poverty.
There's a theme lurking in all this Trumpian trickery. It's that, in both business and politics, reality is often overrated. With enough hot air, even an obvious fraud can stay afloat - for longer than many of us ever expected.

Texto completo: US Measles Cases in 2019 Top 700
THE CENTERS FOR Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the 2019 measles outbreak in the United States now includes 704 cases, many of them clustered in haredi Orthodox communities, JTA reported.
That's the most in any single year since 2000 - the year the CDC declared the disease eradicated in the U.S. Of those 704 cases, 400 are centered in New York City and its suburbs.
The CDC said the resurgence is due to an increase in unvaccinated people, as well as those bringing it back from other countries, including Israel and Ukraine.
Although prominent rabbis in New York have pushed for vaccination, there's a belief in haredi communities that vaccinations are ineffective or even harmful, according to JTA.
NYT Apologizes for Anti-Semitic Cartoons
The New York Times twice apologized for anti-Semitic cartoons it published in late April, JNS.org reported.
An April 25 cartoon featured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dachshund guide dog with a Star of David on his collar. The dog is shown leading a yarmulke-wearing President Donald Trump.
A cartoon in editions that weekend depicted "Netanyahu with sinister eyes taking a picture of himself with a selfie-stick, carrying in what appears to be an empty desert with a tablet featuring the Israeli flag painted on it, " JNS.org said.
In one statement, the Times described the image as both "offensive" and including "anti-Semitic tropes." The next day, it said the cartoon was published because of a "faulty process" that led to a "single editor working without adequate oversight."
About 150 protesters, including former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, protested outside the Times' Midtown Manhattan offices on April 29.
The Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) signed on to a Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) letter sent to the Times April 29 critical of the newspaper's decision-making.
Survey: Jewish Americans Positive Toward Muslims
More than half of Jewish Americans have positive feelings toward Muslims, with just 13 percent holding negative views, according to the 2019 American Muslim Poll, JTA reported.
In all, 53 percent reported positive views, the most of any non-Muslim faith group surveyed. In addition, 53 percent of Jewish Americans said they would decrease their support for any political candidate who endorsed a Muslim ban.
Meantime, 45 percent of Muslim-American respondents favorably viewed Jews, while only 10 percent said they had negative views; the rest were neutral.
Numerous Jews Receive Tony Nominations
Members of the Tribe were well represented in the 2019 Tony Award nominations announced April 30, JTA reported.
Rachel Chavkin is up for best direction of a musical for Hadestown, while Sam Mendes was nominated for best direction of a play for The Ferryman.
Elaine May was nominated for best leading actress in a play for The Waverly Gallery, a semi-autobiographical play by Jewish playwright Kenneth Lonergan.
Actors Brandon Uranowitz and Gideon Glick were both nominated for best featured actor for Burn This and To Kill a Mockingbird, respectively. *

Texto completo: Maddie Moravek, a Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart sophomore from Libertyville, is a big fan of Jean Kwok’s work.
Thanks to support from Ragdale Center for the Arts and a Lake Forest resident’s donation, Maddie was able to enjoy an informal lunch with the best-selling author April 25 as part of a select group of fellow students sharing a strong interest in writing. She described the experience as truly inspiring.
"I’ve always liked writing, so it was great to hear from someone who has actually made it a career," Maddie said. "I’m so grateful to have had this opportunity to meet with and learn from such a successful author. It was amazing all around, and truly a highlight of the school year for me."
Kwok, The New York Times and international best-selling author of novels that include "Girl in Translation" and "Mambo in Chinatown," also gave a formal presentation focusing on her life story and the craft of writing to Woodlands Academy eighth period English classes. She then answered questions from students at the all-girls college-preparatory day-and-boarding high school in Lake Forest.
The students were fascinated by Kwok’s dynamic storytelling, as well as her description of the real-life events that inspired aspects of her novels, according to Woodlands Academy English teacher Jennifer Brostrom.
"The opportunity to learn firsthand from an award-winning author was immensely motivating," Brostrom said. "Jean Kwok’s message for our Woodlands students was to embrace their own unique potential, to reject limitations, and to recognize that failure is an inevitable experience on the road to success."
Kwok immigrated to Brooklyn from Hong Kong when she was 5 years old and worked in a Chinatown clothing factory for much of her childhood. Her literary work has been published in 18 countries and taught in universities, colleges and high schools across the world.

Texto completo: Anyone wondering how Louis C.K. would address his controversial return to stand-up in Minneapolis didn't have to wait long.
"I used to play arenas," he said at the very top of his late-night set Tuesday, the first of four straight nights at the intimate Acme Comedy Co, which holds fewer than 300 people. "Lucky for you, I had a bad year."
C.K., looking trimmer and better groomed than before his forced hiatus, went on to tick off some of the lessons he learned since confirming in late 2017 that he committed sexual misconduct, specifically that he pressured female colleagues into watching him masturbate.
"I learned to eat alone in a restaurant while someone is giving you the finger across the room," he said, seeming completely at ease in a club he has long called one of his favorites. "The only advice I can give you is ask first if you can jerk off in front of someone. If they say yes, say, 'Are you sure?' And if they still say yes, then still, just don't do it."
There were other acknowledgments to his Year of Living Disgracefully in the one-hour set. He mentioned that he spent time in France because he realized he needed to leave the country. He talked about how annoying it is when his doting mother still mails him
newspaper clippings, even the New York Times article that triggered his downfall.
But those nods aside, it was as if C.K. had never been on a break.
He was confident, if not downright delighted, when practicing his signature brand of humor: defending the indefensible and ripping the revered.
There was nothing Tuesday as squeamish as material he tested earlier this year, in which he mocked survivors of the Parkland shooting. But he came close.
At one point, he wondered aloud if it would be so bad if we simply let victims of car accidents languish by the side of the road and suggested that dead monkeys would make great gifts to send to enemies. The World Trade Center tragedy ended up in a punchline. There was more than one incest joke.
These bits easily could have been lifted from his old acts, back when he was praised for his twisted, topsy-turvy train of thought. But in light of what's taken place in the past 18 months, it's understandable that some of his onetime admirers would now find the tone just plain icky.
An apology probably wouldn't have satisfied his detractors on social media or the handful of protesters who set up in front of Acme for more than an hour Tuesday. They didn't get one.
C.K. never fully embraced the role of victim -- but he also never portrayed himself as a former harasser, reformed or otherwise.
Near the end of his set, C.K. wondered if anyone was nostalgic for the days when being homosexual was considered taboo.
"When sex is a little wrong, it's more fun -- for some of us," he said with the gleam that comes to his eye whenever he's taking listeners farther down the rabbit hole than they expected.
It's the kind of joke that will only make the haters double down -- and have his supporters wishing he was sticking around the Twin Cities for another week.

Resumen: 2020 Democrats got real on the issues: guns, opioids and, yes, giving you $1,000.

Texto completo: A spate of shootings in the United States — at a synagogue, a university and a Denver STEM school — rippled into the 2020 race this week as candidates spoke out on gun control and a host of other hot-button topics
An Iowa 8th-grader, through tears, asked Beto O'Rourke what he would do to stop school shootings. "Society is becoming numb to children being slaughtered," she said. O'Rourke, in a civics class, said the power rested with her: "You're forcing people in power to do the right thing right now. "
Also on guns: Cory Booker debuted plans for a national gun licensing program and a one-per-month limit on gun purchases, and President Donald Trump joked about shooting migrants — but "only in the Panhandle. "
Meanwhile, Andrew Yang pitched his plan to dole out $1,000 to every American every month if he's elected. Elizabeth Warren said drug execs should "go to jail" for their role in the opioid epidemic. Bernie Sanders pushed a 15% cap on credit card interest rates to combat "greed" in the banking industry.
Joe Biden, after debuting in earnest last week, hit on the real issue: Who's the real Irishman in the 2020 race? "It's me," Biden said, but John Delaney and O'Rourke may beg to differ.
Want more 2020 Dem policy talk? Look no further than the bastion of the Democratic Party known as . . . . Fox News? They're planning Democratic town halls. Lots of them.
Or, you could just let us slide into your inbox every week. That's probably the better call.
This week in Trump:
Trump lost $1 billion over a decade, according to a New York Times report on the president's old tax documents.
But Trump blamed that billion dollar loss on "write offs," "depreciation" and tax shelters .
More Trump tax records may fall into the hands of New York lawmakers.
His approval ratings are higher than any point since when he first took office.
Trump 'won't back down' on China trade pressure ahead of a high-stakes meeting.
Trump's campaign rally at Panama City Beach came with a plan for Florida disaster relief.
Trump asserted executive privilege over the Mueller report as lawmakers voted to hold William Barr in contempt over it.
This week in 2020 Democrats:
Jill Biden says to get over her husband at the Anita Hill hearings: "It's time to move on. "
Hillary Clinton to 2020 Dems: Oh, FYI, "You can have the election stolen from you. "
Julián Castro, Pete Buttigieg and others want an investigation after video recorded by Sandra Bland surfaced after her death.
Barack Obama's new memoir might land during the 2020 race, putting him in an influential spotlight.
See you next week, OnPolitics friends. Stay mindful this weekend. — Josh Hafner

The king of paparazzi

Texto completo: The celebrity and the paparazzo is one of nature's great symbiotic relationships.
Like the anemone and the clownfish, the leaf hopper and the meat ant, they're essential to each other. The press photographer keeps famous people famous. The VIP is the photographer's meal ticket.
The difference is that the anemone doesn't beat up the clownfish. And the leaf hopper doesn't sue the meat ant for harassment.
Whereas Ron Galella, "paparazzo extraordinaire" who has made his home in Montville, N.J. since 1992, has — among other indignities — been beaten up by Marlon Brando, roughed up by Richard Burton's entourage, and battled Jacqueline Onassis in court.
Nothing personal, Galella is sure.
"I believe that the majority of celebrities do not hate me," said Galella, 88, warming to the subject of his colorful 55-year career in his spacious, high-ceiling living room.
It — and the rest of his house — is crowded with portraits: Frank Sinatra, John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Marlon Brando, Sophia Loren, Andy Warhol, David Bowie, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Whoopi Goldberg, Bruce Springsteen.
There are images of his late wife, Betty Burke Galella, who died in January, 2017. And there are multiple portraits of the other love of his life, the celebrity subject with whom he's most identified, his favorite of favorites: Jackie O.
The feeling may or may not have been mutual.
"Jackie did not hate me," Galella ventured. "When she said, 'Smash his camera!' to her agent, it's not because she didn't want the pictures, but because I photographed John Jr. on his bike, and she did not want those pictures published. She wanted privacy for her children. If she had been alone, that never would have happened."
His work is everywhere Galella's work has appeared in Time, Life, Newsweek, Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, and The New York Times. He's been exhibited in galleries in New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin. Andy Warhol called Galella his "favorite photographer." His collected works have appeared in books, among them "Jackie: My Obsession," "Sex in Fashion," "No Pictures," "Rock & Roll," "The Master Builder" (his Donald Trump portfolio) and his latest, "Shooting Stars."
At the moment, his work can also be seen at the Columbia Inn in Montville, where prints of 75 of his most famous pictures are on display in the downstairs bar area and upstairs banquet room (the prints are for sale; half the money goes to the restaurant and half to Galella).
"I think he's a really great photographer, and I think that's something people miss with his work," said Ryan McDermott, owner of the Columbia Inn. "They think of him as just a paparazzo. He's really a fantastic photographer."
Paparazzi have always gotten a bad rap: the more so after August 1997, when the death of Diana Princess of Wales in a car, pursued by shutterbugs, cast an ugly light on the photographers' habits of swarming celebrities. And Galella will concede that some of his brethren, in recent years, have gotten more aggressive.
"The paparazzi today have a bad name, because most of them do it for money," he said. "They invade privacy, they get too close. They want to provoke [celebrities] into having an accident, so they'll have more salable pictures. I shot them one-on-one. Whereas it's gang-banging now."
But paparazzi got the stink-eye from the beginning — when Federico Fellini coined the term in his 1960 film "La Dolce Vita."
Or rather, he coined the character Paparazzo, played by Walter Santesso — an intrusive photographer who ambushes the Beautiful People haunting the fashionable spots of Rome. His name became the term for the breed.
"You could say that the paparazzi in Rome started it, when they went up to the Via Veneto to cafes and shot the celebrities there," Galella said.
The name was meant to be snide. Paparazzo, Fellini told Time magazine, "suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging." In the 1983 movie "The Right Stuff," the hordes of photographers invading the homes of the Mercury astronauts are accompanied by sounds of swarming locusts.
But it's the paparazzi who forged our modern-day, warts-and-all view of celebrity — and thus our 2019 tabloid, reality-TV world.
A celebrity photographer, in the old days, had been a kind of vestal virgin. He, or she, was an attendant to the gods, a burnisher of mysteries, a keeper of the sacred flame.
Photographers like George Hurrell, Clarence Sinclair Bull and Ruth Harriet Louise shot stars in "glamour" poses, with perfect hair and perfect porcelain skin, perfectly lit, lounging on satin bedsheets, or emerging from the shadows as if they had been summoned from the world's subconscious. Stars were otherworldly, ethereal, perfect. Photographers always got their good side.
"They had the advantage of photographing in the studio, with clean white backgrounds and and good lighting," Galella said. "But they don't have the spontaneity, the real genuine expressions on the faces of the subjects. The subject always wants to be something more glamorous. They're not themselves."
Taking his best shot Born poor in the Bronx, son of Italian immigrants, Galella learned his trade as an air force photographer during the Korean War, then graduated with a degree in photojournalism from the ArtCenter College of Design in Los Angeles. He began his career as a freelance, selling images of movie stars, taken at Hollywood premieres, to magazines like National Enquirer and Photoplay.
After that, he spent a lifetime seeing stars. Usually, under less than optimal conditions.
"Marlon Brando punched me," he recalled. "He knocked the teeth out of my lower jaw. That was in 1973. One year later, I came back prepared. I wore a football helmet when he had a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria."
A picture of a glowering Marlon Brando, next to Galella in his football helmet, then became a coup for another paparazzo when it appeared in People magazine.
Richard Burton, in 1972, didn't stoop to punching Galella. He had his flunkies do it.
"Richard Burton had it in for me," Galella recalled. The occasion was the on-location Mexico shoot of "Hammersmith is Out," a less-remembered Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor extravaganza, directed by Peter Ustinov. Galella, camera in hand, was discovered hiding in a cave.
"They took all my film away from me, and held me captive, and they went to my hotel and took away all my film for one-week's shooting — 15 rolls of film, over 5,000 stills," Galella said. "And Richard Burton ordered three of his crewmen to beat me up. They gave me a broken tooth and a black eye. They were beating me on the back. There were three security policemen who didn't do nothing but watch. I said, 'Arrest those people!' Finally they stopped, put me in jail for 45 minutes, and then released me.
"I sued Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and I lost the case. They wanted me to sign a release that they had nothing to do with the beating. And they had everything to do with it. They were drunk on the set. But to me the worst was, not only was I beaten up, but they destroyed 15 rolls of my art."

Lake County should settle statue controversy

Texto completo: If there is one thing at which Lake County commissioners excel, it's ignoring a stewing pot of venom that is about to explode and embarrass the county nationwide.
That used to be the School Board's specialty, but now commissioners have taken over because we can't let a year pass without Lake looking foolish and backward in the national press.
For months, commissioners have been avoiding a dispute over the Lake County Historical Society's proposal to bring the statue of a Confederate general with no local ties to the society's museum on the first floor of the historic courthouse in Tavares.
The ol' boy, Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, is being evicted from National Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C., and he'll be replaced by a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune, the black civil rights and education advocate who helped found Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach.
Even the Legislature, typically a clueless bunch, realized that the time has passed to honor those who fought to protect the the institution of slavery.
Last week, the dispute over the statue ratcheted up a few notches when more than 250 people crammed into the historic courthouse lobby and lined the stairs where a typical meeting of the society usually consists of a few dozen mostly older, dedicated history buffs.
The burst in membership came about when anti-statue folks started joining the historical society, prompting a pro-statue recruiting drive that culminated in last week's clash. None of this had to happen if county commissioners had manned up.
The society's curator and leader, Bob Grenier, applied on behalf of the historical society to get the statue after it leaves the hall without consulting anyone in the black community.
Did he seriously think people of color whose great-great-grandparents could have been slaves wouldn't mind an oversized reminder of their repression? Of course not, which is why he kept his plan on the downlow.
And he and other society leaders pulled another fast one prior to the meeting.
The new members learned that the board of directors about two weeks ago had changed the bylaws so that a person would have to be a member for at least two years before becoming eligible to be president of the organization.
Gee, that's not self-serving for Grenier, is it?
The announcement produced a wave of protest from those who hadn't received any such announcement.
Commissioners claim they have no say over the historical society. This is smoke. They fund nearly 100 percent of the group's annual budget, and the society acts as an arm of the county with the help of a commission liaison, who currently is commission Chairwoman Leslie Campione. If commissioners refuse to have the statue in the historical courthouse where blacks were once beaten in the basement, then it doesn't come. Period.
Instead, commissioners unwisely misspent $3,900 to determine whether the 9,000-pound statue would crash into the basement of the historical courthouse (it won't) or whether it might damage irreplaceable historical floor tiles (it will.)
This is a controversy crying out for leadership. The nonsense will go on as long as commissioners do nothing because nobody on either side is changing their mind. And sooner or later, some reporter at the New York Times will hear of the 1950-type controversy in its go-to hillbilly community in Central Florida, and there we'll be in its hallowed pages. Again.
Any question why? Simple: Honoring a pro-slavery fighter isn't normal in a country dedicated to equal rights for everyone.
Financial lessons
The late Sen. Dorothy Hukill, the Port Orange Republican who represented part of Lake County, had several times introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have required Florida students to take a half-credit course in personal finances.
So to honor her, legislators this year were determined to pass the Dorothy L. Hukill Financial Literacy Act, which would have high-schoolers learn to balance checkbooks, figure out local and federal taxes and manage personal debt.
Talk about practical education. The essence of the proposal was included in a broader education bill, which is going to the governor for a signature. That's a worthy legacy for Hukill, who died of cancer.

Texto completo: More than two years after losing his morning show job because of his appearance in the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape, Billy Bush will return to television in the fall, Warner Bros. announced on Wednesday.
He will anchor an entertainment news show called "ExtraExtra," which is distributed by Warner Bros. and will air on a number of local Fox stations beginning in September.
In the final sprint of the 2016 presidential campaign, The Washington Post released a recording from 2005 in which President Trump, then the Republican nominee, could be heard making vulgar comments about groping women while Mr. Bush laughed and goaded him on. Mr. Bush was recording an "Access Hollywood" segment with Mr. Trump on the set of "Days of Our Lives," where Mr. Trump was making a cameo.
Mr. Bush, 47, was widely criticized for his role in the tape and quickly lost his job as one of the 9 a.m. hosts of NBC's "Today" just months after he joined the show.
In an op-ed in The New York Times a year after the recording was published, Mr. Bush said he and the other men on the bus "assumed we were listening to a crass standup act."
"He was performing," Mr. Bush wrote of Mr. Trump. "Surely, we thought, none of this was real. We now know better."
In his new position, Mr. Bush will anchor a reboot of the long-running show "Extra," which will be rebranded as "ExtraExtra" for its 26th season. In an interview with People, which was first to report the news, Mr. Bush said of the "Access Hollywood" tape: "It was a bad moment. And I was in it. But one moment doesn't define your life." He declined to comment further on Wednesday.
Mr. Bush, a cousin of former President George W. Bush, first appeared on "Extra" in 2002, which he said was his first job on national television. In addition to his work on "Today" and "Access Hollywood," he has hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called "The Billy Bush Show."
"Billy is the consummate journalist with extensive celebrity industry contacts and reach," Lisa Gregorisch-Dempsey, the show's senior executive producer, said in a statement. "He's the perfect host as we reinvent 'Extra' for a new generation. I'm thrilled to welcome him back to television."

Texto completo: A Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg bounced around South Carolina trying to drum up black support recently, media coverage was thick. Buttigieg is a flavor of the moment in a campaign that may burn through a dozen media darlings.
His outreach did not work. Even in heavily black communities like North Charleston and Orangeburg, the crowds for the South Bend, Indiana, mayor were mostly white. Stories from The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal and The Post and Courier of Charleston dutifully reported the lack of black turnout.
But none of those stories used the word "gay." That, given the animus against homosexuality and same-sex marriage among many in the black community and its churches, is journalistic malpractice.
There have been plenty of stories about Buttigieg's sexual orientation, and his husband, Chasten Buttigieg. Most have put some focus on whether voters will reject the Harvard University graduate because he is married to a man. But the stories have focused on the homophobia of white conservatives as a stumbling block for Buttigieg, which it isn't. He has no shot at getting their votes in a general election, gay or not.
If Buttigieg's gayness hurts him in this primary race or the general election, it will be with the black Democratic voters whose support he desperately needs, not white Republicans he could never woo.
About 12 percent of all voters, and 25 percent of Democratic primary voters, are black. As New York Times columnist Charles Blow pointed out in an April piece about Buttigieg's chances with blacks (which never mentioned that he is gay), the majority of Democratic primary voters in 2016 in the early voting states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia were black.
According to a 2017 poll from the Pew Research Center, only 51 percent of black Americans supported same-sex marriage, while 64 percent of white voters do. But in the past two elections, about 90 percent of blacks voted Democrat, so having a big percentage of that population oppose Buttigieg's lifestyle is potentially a problem. That could be particularly true, in a primary or general election, with black churchgoers, whose pastors have historically opposed homosexuality.
Will it be? Opinions vary.
"He will only have a problem with those black churches who have consumed the Kool-Aid of the white evangelicals," the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said in an interview. Butts said black voters will judge Buttigieg on his policies and stances, not his sexuality, even though many oppose same-sex marriage. But Butts allowed that if Buttigieg tried to "push it down their throats, kiss and hold hands in front of cameras," moves about which the candidate has been public, he could push away black voters. And in a field with more than 20 options, alienating any significant part of a large block of voters is deadly.
The Rev. William Owens, who heads the Coalition of African-American Pastors, a group that includes thousands of black clergy members who fight for laws supporting biblical values, says Buttigieg's sexuality makes his candidacy a nonstarter for many churchgoing black Democrats.
"You might get a few newcomer black pastors who are trying to pacify white liberals by supporting gay marriage, but the bulk of us are highly opposed," Owens said.
The campaign will show whether homosexuality is still enough of a taboo in the black community to cost Buttigieg. But pointing out potential homophobia among large blocks of Democratic voters appears to be a taboo in the journalism community. That journalistic finger-pointing is reserved for conservative voters.
And that's not right.

Texto completo: We’re in the thick of season announcements season. Even if you don’t buy season tickets (though most arts organizations wish you would, and with the funding environment in flux, now would be a good time to show that kind of support), you can at least make notes on your calendar or stick Post-its on the fridge. Then you won’t be saying “I wish I had known about that before it was sold out/over!”
The Jungle Theater announced its 2019-20 season last night at a fundraiser. Artistic director Sarah Rasmussen’s reinvention of a Twin Cities institution continues with more plays written by, directed by and featuring women and people of color that confront and illuminate issues of our time. Even its Jane Austen sequels have a 21st-century edge.
Speaking of those, both “Miss Bennet: Christmas at Pemberley” and “The Wickhams,” a Jungle co-commission, will return for the holidays, running in repertory . A theater that never had a holiday play now has two, and why not stage both at the same time? Go upstairs and downstairs at the Darcy mansion, Nov. 18-Dec. 29. Christina Baldwin will direct.
Before then, the Jungle will launch its season with a quirky new musical by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell. In “Ride the Cyclone,” most of the characters are dead, killed in a freak accident on a roller coaster. With help from a fortune-telling machine (Jim Lichtscheidl), one will return to the world of the living, but which one? Sarah Rasmussen will direct. Sept. 11-Oct. 20.
In the New Year, Lucas Hnath’s “A Doll’s House: Part 2” will take us back to Ibsen, except years have passed and Nora Helmer has returned. But why, and what will that do to the family she left? Joanie Schultz will direct; Baldwin will be Nora. Jan. 15-Feb. 23, 2020.
Next up, Brittany K. Allen’s “Redwood,” which had its world premiere just last fall. Imagine you’re a young black woman engaged to a young white man. Then you learn your fiancé’s ancestors once owned your ancestors. Where do you find that kind of forgiveness? H. Adam Harris will direct. March 11-April 12.
Spring will bring Amy Herzog’s “Mary Jane,” about a single mother caring for a child with chronic illness. The New York Times called it “a heartbreaker for anyone human.” Sarah Rasmussen will direct, and the Jungle’s production will feature Sally Wingert. May 2-31.
The 2019-20 season will end with Lauren Yee’s award-winning “Cambodian Rock Band,” co-produced with Theater Mu. Thirty years after fleeing Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, a man returns in search of his daughter. The play is a time-traveling mystery with music. The Chicago Sun-Times called it “crazily clever and compelling.” Joshua Kahan Brody will direct. June 24-Aug. 2.
Rasmussen calls this “a dream season for the Jungle.” It’s a 100-percent 21st-century season. Although the plays themselves cover a large sweep of time, all but one had their world premieres in 2016 or later. (“Ride the Cyclone” made its U.S. premiere in 2015 but opened in Canada in 2008.) So except for the Austen sequels, these will all be plays most of us have never seen. Season tickets go on sale July 22.
In other news, the Jungle’s commission of “Little Women,” which had its world premiere here in 2018-19, will move to Dallas Theater Center and the Old Globe in San Diego in 2020. Rasmussen will direct both productions.
Ten Thousand Things to start 2019-20 with Shakespeare
In its second year under artistic director Marcela Lorca, who succeeded founding artistic director Michelle Hensley, Ten Thousand Things Theater will present three plays, starting with Shakespeare’s “The Winter’s Tale,” which opens Oct. 3. TTT has always excelled at Shakespeare, making it accessible and fresh for some of the toughest crowds in town, including prisoners.
In case you’re new to the cities or haven’t yet met TTT, the theater doesn’t have a home of its own. Instead, it tours its bare-bones, stripped-down, fit-everything-in-a-suitcase productions to correctional facilities, housing projects, homeless shelters, and schools before moving into Open Book for paid public performances.
The cast of “The Winter’s Tale” will be led by Shá Cage and Stephen Epp, both worth dropping everything and going out to see. Lorca will direct.
Keith Glover’s “Thunder Knocking on the Door” will open Feb. 20, 2020. In this bluesy show with music by Keb’ Mo’ and Anderson Edwards, a shapeshifter challenges a blind songstress to a duel on the Delta Blues guitar. Lorca will direct, with Sanford Moore as music director. “Thunder Knocking” was staged at the Guthrie in 1998.
The season will close with Lauren Yee’s “The Hatmaker’s Wife,” which bends space and time to explore the ideas of family, home and love. Yee also has a play in the Jungle’s new season, and last year the Guthrie produced “The Great Leap,” her play about basketball. Michelle O’Neill will direct “The Hatmaker’s Wife,” which will open April 23.
Tickets will go on sale in September.
The picks
Tonight (Tuesday, May 7) at the Merriam Park Library: Club Book presents Charles C. Mann. Club Book’s current season ends with historian Charles C. Mann, whose first two New York Times best-sellers were set in the late 1400s. His new book, The Wizard and the Prophet, fast-forwards several centuries to look at two scientists who laid the groundwork for the environmentalist movement. 7 p.m. Free. FMI.
Wednesday at the Trylon: Sound Unseen presents “Her Smell.” We’re so conflicted. We love the star — Elisabeth Moss — but loathe the title of Alex Ross Perry’s film about a ’90s punk rock superstar who struggles with sobriety, personal demons and the past. Everyone who sees it thinks of Courtney Love. The reviews are effusive. Here’s the trailer. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($12).
Thursday at 900 Hennepin: Lit Voices featuring Joe Davis. The latest installment of a free monthly series that spotlights the contributions of hometown poets, spoken word and rap artists. This month’s featured artist is Joe Davis, a poet, educator and cultural architect who fronts the soul, funk and spoken word ensemble The Poetic Diaspora, has served as teaching artist at dozens of high schools and universities, and most recently was artist-in-residence at Luther Seminary, where he graduated with a master’s degree in theology of the arts. 7:30 p.m. Free. 900 Hennepin is right next door to the Orpheum Theatre.
Friday through Sunday at the Ritz Theater : Black Label Movement presents “Teamwork 2.0.” The daring, athletic BLM’s 12th Minnesota season features three works by Artistic Director Carl Flink: “Canary” (2012), which Flink describes as “a surrealistic vision of a prom night at the bottom of a coal mine”; “This Bleeding Heart …” (2005), newly paired with an original soundscape by Andrea Reynolds; and the premiere of “Morituri te Salutant” (We who are about to die salute you), with an original soundscape by Greg Brosofske and live video projections created in real time by Off-Leash Area’s Paul Herwig. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4. FMI and tickets ($20/10).
Saturday at the A-Mill Artist Lofts : Out of the Box Opera ’s “The Amazing Adventures of Acis and Galatea, the Wonder Nymph.” It can truthfully be said that one never knows what OOTB will do next. Creator of the Diva Cage Match and fusion events that combine opera with gospel, jazz and soul, Artistic Director David Lefkowich means to light the fire of opera love in all of us, by any means necessary. This time he’s taking small audiences (limit 60) through the Pillsbury A-Mill for a roaming, site-specific performance of Handel’s “Acis and Galatea” inspired by comic books and the New York underground sensation “Sleep No More” (a site-specific telling of “Macbeth” in an abandoned hotel). The music is from Handel’s “Acis and Galatea,” based on Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” a version of which is also on stage at the Guthrie by sheer coincidence. Lyric coloratura soprano Siena Forest, tenor David Walton and bass Andrew Wilkowske will be joined by a “Greek chorus” of five ensemble singers as the performance moves from underground tunnels to the rooftop, with afterparty and full bar. At 5, 7 and 9 p.m. FMI and tickets ($50/65).

Texto completo: Strawberries were dying. The red berries were once a profitable crop in Sussex County, but by the 1920s, the soil was so depleted that many farms could no longer support strawberries as cash crop.
Many growers were abandoning strawberries when help came from an unexpected source.
In 1874, the New York Times reported, "Strawberries, which next to peaches are the great fruit crop of the (Delmarva) peninsula."
Strawberries do not ripen after they are harvested; the fruit needs to be left on the vine until it is at the peak of its juicy freshness. Consequently, the berries had to be picked and shipped quickly.
When the strawberries began to ripen, crowds of pickers were recruited from the slums of the big cities to harvest the fruit. The pickers often arrived in the fields at three in the morning; and working by the light of oil lamps, they spent hours hunched over, plucking strawberries and loading them into small baskets.
The baskets were packed onto horse-drawn wagons which carried the delicate fruit to Selbyville, Millsboro, and other southern Delaware rail depots, where the berries were loaded into newly-developed refrigerated railroad cars.
The cold-packing in the refrigerated cars was the secret to keeping the fruit from rotting.
When strawberries were being harvested, buyers flooded into Selbyville, where they erected tents along the town's streets so that they could be ready at sunup, when the first wagonloads of strawberries arrived in town.
The wagons lined up at the auction block on Church Street and from there, the berries were taken to the railroad station for shipment to big city markets.
Raising strawberries in Sussex County peaked in the early years of the 20th century. The soil had become depleted, and by the beginning of the 1920s, many growers had turned to other crops.
The completion of the Du Pont Highway in 1923, however, revived the strawberry crop in southern Delaware.
Two years after the highway was finished, the Wilmington Sunday Star reported, "Rumors from Georgetown that Sussex County farmers were going to abandon the raising of strawberries because ... the soil had failed to properly nourish them, are laughed at by the farmers whose crops of strawberries for years have one of their best paying enterprises."
Strawberry growers had learned to fertilize their strawberry patches to prevent the nutrients in the soil from becoming depleted. In addition, the completion of the Du Pont Highway provided growers a way to truck their berries to market.
Instead of shipping strawberries in refrigerated railroad cars, growers packed the berries in large "cold-packed" barrels which were loaded onto trucks.
According to the Sunday Star, "The cold pack process is one that each farmer keeps a secret unto himself. They each have their own particular way of packing the berries into huge barrels, the same size as vinegar barrels.
"The general method followed is to pack sound berries between successive layers of granulated sugar. The barrel is sealed and made airtight, and if properly done, it is said the berries will last indefinitely.
"These are the strawberries you eat in November and December in your ice cream and sometimes in your sundae over the soda fountain. But only good sound berries are used, because if the fruit should be soft or the least bit decayed, it might spoil the entire barrel."
The unexpected combination of the new Du Pont Highway and sugary cold-packing enabled the strawberry crop to remain an important crop in southern Delaware for the next 15 years, when it was no longer a major crop in southern Delaware.

Two more years? Trump's retweet sets off furor over the idea of bonus time.

Texto completo: Those close to president say he is joking, but his detractors aren't amused
President Trump for months has griped, complained and tweeted about what he says is the unfair Russia "witch hunt" investigation that has consumed nearly half of his presidency.
Now, the president has floated a possible solution: two bonus years.
Trump over the weekend shared a tweet by Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, in which Falwell complimented Trump for "no obstruction, no collusion" and a soaring economy, before adding, "Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup."
White House officials and others close to the president said he was joking and is not serious about trying to increase his first four-year term by 50 percent - an extension that would violate the Constitution and has no historical precedent.
But Trump's suggestion came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also raised concerns about the president potentially refusing to accept the legitimacy of a Democratic victory in the 2020 presidential election - saying it was important that Democrats win "big" to protect the country from such an outcome.
"We have to inoculate against that, we have to guard against that," Pelosi told the New York Times.
The remarks underscore real anxiety within factions of the country that Trump - who repeatedly complained about a "rigged" election in 2016 - may decide to contest the legitimacy of the election in 2020 if he is defeated or otherwise argue for an extended time in office.
"Everything that he says is a trial balloon - even his, quote, jokes are trial balloons," said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University professor who studies authoritarian rulers. "But if you look at what he jokes about, it's always things like this - it's the extension of his rights, it's the infringement of liberties. And authoritarians are continually testing the boundaries to see what they can get away with, and everything he does is a challenge to Democrats to mount some response against him."
Trump's defenders say the president is merely being provocative, expressing his real anger over the extent to which special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe has consumed his presidency. White House aides and other friends say they have not heard Trump privately discuss the possibility of an extended term - often an early warning sign he is seriously entertaining a controversial action.
Asked about Trump's suggestion that he receive two more years in office, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) chuckled and said, "I think y'all people are crazy."
"When it comes to Trump, people need to dial it back a little bit," said Graham, who added that when he once jokingly suggested Trump receive a third term, "people went nuts."
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) suggested that the tweet should be viewed as an example of Trump's understated wit, but also that it reflects a president deeply exasperated by how the Russian investigation has clouded his presidency.
"The president has sort of a dry sense of humor," Cornyn said. "He obviously understands that's not possible but I take his point that there's been two years of distractions based on claims that proved not to be substantiated. So again I understand his frustration."
Falwell himself said in an interview Monday that he and Trump had never discussed the topic before and did not speak after the president shared his tweet. He said he believes there needs to be a "day of reckoning" for those responsible for the special counsel investigation, but understands Trump is not going to extend his current term by two years.
"I know there's no constitutional mechanism to add a couple years to his term, but he definitely deserves to be compensated, so it was a little bit tongue-in-cheek," Falwell said.
More broadly, the idea that the special counsel investigation resulted in two "stolen" years of Trump's presidency has already become a reelection argument for Trump and his allies.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted about his "tremendous success" in office, despite the fact that "they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back."
And in a statement Monday, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh wrote that Trump "has been hounded mercilessly for two solid years and still has racked up tremendous wins on behalf of the American people."
"That he has succeeded in the face of unprecedented partisan attacks is absolutely an argument for his reelection," Murtaugh said.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley also responded, saying, "How hilariously ironic that it's the Democrats who refuse to accept the results of a free and fair presidential election in 2016, refuse to accept the clear results of a nearly 400-page report that showed no collusion and no obstruction, but now, they have the audacity to question the president 'accepting results?' - give me a break."
During the 2016 campaign, Trump frequently denounced the election as "rigged" without providing any evidence, and on multiple occasions refused to commit to accepting the results if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were to prevail.
During the final debate in Las Vegas, for instance, when asked if he would accept the results on Election Day, Trump twice demurred, concluding, "I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense." Clinton called his response "horrifying," and accused him of "talking down our democracy."
Even on Election Day, Trump remained noncommittal, hinting in a pair of radio interviews that he might contest the election results if they were too close.
At the time, Trump's rhetoric prompted some of his supporters to speak of revolution, calling for a "coup" and "bloodshed," and saying if she won, Clinton should be removed from office "by any means necessary."
Speaking to the House Oversight Committee in February, Michael Cohen - Trump's former personal attorney who reported to prison Monday for campaign finance violations and tax evasion - expressed concern that Trump might yet again toy with not accepting unfavorable election results.
"Indeed, given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power, and this is why I agreed to appear before you today," Cohen told the committee.
The president - who won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to Clinton - also asserted multiple times, without evidence, that "millions of people" voted illegally in 2016, costing him the popular vote.
"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," the then-president-elect wrote in a November 2016 tweet. He made a similar claim in 2018, falsely stating that "millions and millions of people" illegally voted "many times."
Trump was so incensed by the fact that he had not won the popular vote that he tasked Vice President Pence with heading a Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to investigate what he claimed was massive voter fraud. The commission ultimately disbanded amid legal challenges and infighting, having produced no evidence of widespread fraud. But in a statement announcing the group's dissolution, Trump nonetheless cited "substantial evidence of voter fraud."
In other instances, Trump has more clearly adopted a lighthearted tone. During a closed-door fundraiser at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida in March 2018, Trump addressed Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent consolidation of power, noting with envy that Xi was now "president for life."
"I think it's great," Trump said. "Maybe we'll have to give it a shot some day."
Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said he was not amused, calling it "extremely offensive for the president of the United States to make those types of statements even if they are intended to be in jest."
"When you look at people who have used authoritarian practices that have brought down democracies, they have used excuses to stay in power," Cardin added when asked why he felt such remarks were dangerous. "It may be in jest, but you still don't do that in jest."
Falwell, the man whose tweet started the entire drama, said he was not worried about Trump trying to upend the nation's electoral system. He said he recalled concern among conservatives that former president Barack Obama would not vacate the White House after two terms, but that worry was unfounded.
"I always knew the Constitution would prevail and we're still a country of laws," he said. "I think people on both extremes, on the left and the right, tend to get a little bit hysterical when somebody is in office that they don't like, and I think that's all we're seeing."

Texto completo: Education secretary Betsy DeVos continued to advocate for robust school choice in front of a room of several hundred journalists attending the Education Writers Association's annual conference in Baltimore on Monday.
In a wide-ranging interview, the Department of Education's controversial leader defended her push for a federal tax credit that would fund scholarships for students to attend private schools and other educational programs.
She said she is reaching out to Congress members on the other side of the aisle to garner support for "Education Freedom Scholarships." For too long, DeVos argued, educators have been trying the same approaches with little positive change.
"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean better experiences and more excellence at every school," she said. "Whether it's a neighborhood school or one across town that you choose to go to because it has a specific program that you're interested in."
She defended her department's decision to rescind Obama-era guidance to local schools that attempted to reduce suspensions of black and special education children, groups that have been more frequently targeted for discipline.
She said the guidance was not linked to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year and had been criticized as making schools unsafe as it reduced zero-tolerance discipline practices.
"We felt it was an overreach by the previous administration," she said.
While acknowledging that some teachers need to be better paid, DeVos was critical of the teacher strikes which have happened from West Virginia to California in the past two years.
"Great teachers need to be well paid," she said, but "I think it's important that adults have adult disagreements on adult time."
DeVos took a direct swipe at Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest unions.
"Great teachers perhaps should be making at least half as much of what Randi Weingarten does at half a million dollars a year," she said.
Weingarten responded with a statement saying, "I'd be delighted if Betsy wants to get all teachers close to $200,000 - they deserve that - and so much more."
She also ribbed reporters, saying that while "many in the media use my name as click-bait," coverage should not be focused on her.
"Education is not about Betsy DeVos, nor about any other individual," she said. "It's about students."
Asked during the interview with New York Times education reporter Erica L. Green whether she would agree to serve for another four years if Trump is re-elected, DeVos was noncommittal.
"I'm not sure my husband would be OK with that," she said.

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday named Mark Morgan, a former Obama administration official who has aligned himself with some of Trump's hard-line positions on border security, as the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Morgan served as the Border Patrol chief at the end of the Obama administration, and was also previously an FBI agent. He will lead the agency that arrests, detains, and deports people who are in the United States illegally, after Trump last month withdrew his previous nominee, Ronald D. Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher direction."
The move continues a leadership churn at the Department of Homeland Security as Trump seeks to overhaul the department. In recent weeks, the president has forced out multiple top officials, including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Though Morgan served in the Obama administration, he has backed some of Trump's tougher immigration positions.
In an interview on Fox News on April 15, Morgan said he supported Trump's suggestion that he might send migrants crossing the border to so-called sanctuary cities that are defying a crackdown by ICE.

Stretch of road in LA renamed Obama Boulevard
A stretch of road in Los Angeles has been renamed after former president Barack Obama.
A concert and ceremony Saturday unveiled Obama Boulevard. The street replaced Rodeo Road, a 3½-mile street that runs across the city's historic black neighborhood. It also intersects with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and further establishes a "presidential row" that includes Washington, Adams, and Jefferson boulevards.
"I get to live in a lifetime where we elected our first black president," the Rev. Russell Thornhill of South Los Angeles told KABC TV. "I get to share that with my mother, who's 92 years old who voted and actually went to the inauguration. I called her before I came here to let her know what I was doing, and she was just in tears because she was seeing in her lifetime . . . the naming of a street of the first black president in this community."
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti noted at Saturday's ceremony that Obama Boulevard is in a section of the city that has a number of other streets named after presidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.
A couple who proposed the name change told the Times they wanted to raise the profile of the road, attract more funding for the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw neighborhood, and honor the 44th president.

Buttigieg, husband attend Carter's Sunday school class
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, joined the large crowd at former president Jimmy Carter's Sunday school class in rural Georgia.
At Carter's invitation Buttigieg stood and read from the Bible as part of the lesson at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains.
"You know him?" Carter had said earlier in reference to Buttigieg, drawing a laugh from the crowd.
The South Bend, Ind., mayor later tweeted: "I was humbled to meet with President Carter in Plains, Georgia today. He is a true public servant and America is blessed for his continuing leadership." The Buttigieg campaign said that he had lunch with Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, and "enjoyed a conversation about topics ranging from faith to the rigors of the campaign trail."
Carter, 94, said he knew Buttigieg from working on a Habitat for Humanity project in Indiana where the mayor volunteered.

Sanders calls for breaking up big agriculture monopolies
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday proposed a sweeping agriculture and rural investment plan to break up big agriculture monopolies and shift farm subsidies toward small family farmers.
"I think a farmer that produces the food we eat may be almost as important as some crook on Wall Street who destroys the economy," Sanders said during a campaign event in Osage, Iowa, a town of fewer than 4,000 people. During his speech, Sanders outlined the dire circumstances confronting rural America — population decline, school and hospital closures, and rising addiction and suicide rates — as the impetus for his policy.
His plan includes a number of antitrust proposals, including breaking up existing agriculture monopolies and placing a moratorium on future mergers by big agriculture companies. He would also ban "vertically integrated" agribusinesses — companies that control multiple levels of production and processing of a product.

Trump makes Russia issue worse, Klobuchar says
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on Sunday sharply criticized President Trump's response to Russian interference in US elections, saying that he "makes it worse by calling it a hoax."
Trump had a lengthy phone call Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. After being asked by reporters whether he raised the issue of election interference, Trump acknowledged, "We didn't discuss that."
Klobuchar accused Trump of dismissing the seriousness of the issue. "This was actually an invasion of our democracy, OK?" she said on CNN's "State of the Union."
In a Friday tweet, Trump said he and Putin discussed the "Russian Hoax," referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

IS VENEZUELA'S MILITARY REALLY LOYAL TO MADURO, OR ITS OWN SURVIVAL?

Texto completo: The Venezuelan military officers, summoned to the feared headquarters of the Military Counter Intelligence Agency, found themselves in a room wondering what was looming behind the piece of cloth covering the bulletin board facing them.
Having to be there was bad enough. The agency, known by its acronym DGCIM, is notorious for holding some 200 to 300 officers and military personnel who have been sent over the years for punishment after being arrested on accusations of conspiring to depose the socialist regime headed by Nicolás Maduro. Reports of dire conditions and torture abound, the term "hell" often used to describe what it's like to be in DGCIM custody.
So when the cloth was pulled off, what this recent group of uniformed officers saw chilled their blood.
"Pinned to the board were pictures of their wives, their parents, their children and their grandchildren," said former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who got firsthand accounts of the incident. Mr. Ledezma is a key ally to Venezuela's interim President Juan Guaidó, whose challenge to Mr. Maduro's rule is backed by the U.S. and some 50 other nations.
As the summoned military officers absorbed the images of their loved ones, DGCIM officials issued this warning, according to sources familiar with the gathering: "We know what you have been doing and we will make them disappear if you continue talking to Guaidó."
The incident is one of many anecdotes that offer insight as to how the Maduro regime - under tutelage of the Cuban Intelligence Directorate, according to the U.S. - manages to keep a tight grip on its military. Such credible threats of arrest, torture and even death to those who veer off course or their loved ones are among the extreme measures used to keep the rank-and-file in line.
The other tactic for ensuring loyalty at the higher levels of the military comes through promises of riches. Key military officers often get a piece of profits that come as a result of corruption and criminal endeavors, including drug trafficking, according to U.S. officials.
Such tactics, which has been effective in Cuba for six decades, are making it difficult to get rid of Mr. Maduro. But the underlying question in Venezuela: is the military really loyal to the regime - or its own survival?
"As long as the senior members of the military are getting paid, Maduro is going to stay," said Bueno de Mesquita, a politics professor at New York University and author of the book "The Dictator's Handbook."
"For many of them the question really is not whether Maduro is sustainable, but whether the Maduro regime is sustainable. If the money is jeopardized by having Maduro in place, all they have to do is pull a name out of a hat who is a loyalist who then announces to the world, 'Maduro, in the interest of the people, has stepped down and Joe Blow, the Minister of Whatever, has been selected to take his place.'
"It is really a question of whether the flow of money can continue in a reliable way to the senior civil servants, to the military generals and to the judges," Mr. de Mesquita said. "If the answer is yes, then the leaders may continue with Maduro or they might choose someone else from within the Maduro circle.
"If the answer is no, because the international community will not be satisfied with substituting Maduro with somebody else from within (the inner circle), then people will start to defect and Guaidó can come to power," he said.
President Donald Trump's administration is keenly aware that Mr. Maduro's ability to pay off key members of his inner circle is essential to his survival, experts said. Crippling sanctions are aimed at cutting off access to billions of dollars in oil revenues, large sums of which have been stashed at bank accounts of various high-ranking Venezuelan officials and are now frozen due to sanctions.
But there are billions of dollars still flowing into the regime's pockets - and those at the helm of the military - through criminal enterprises, such as drug-trafficking and gold and gasoline smuggling operations, experts say.
"The Venezuelan high command has been benefiting from a complex system of patronage, which include corruption schemes linked to food imports and in the case of a small and select group, to drug trafficking, gold smuggling and fuel smuggling operations," said Diego Moya-Ocampos, principal political analyst for Latin America at IHS Markit,
"Key operators in this group, fearing that they would be brought to justice if there is a regime change, will block any attempt that might come within the armed forces to back Guaidó," Mr. Moya-Ocampos said.
Recent U.S. indictments against Venezuelan officials illustrate just how deep corruption spreads. Among the most recent cases: Mr. Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and Ms. Flores' sons are at the center of a $1.2 billion money laundering case in Miami's Federal Court. Meanwhile, Ms. Flores' nephews were sentenced in 2017 to a prison term of 18 years on drug trafficking convictions.
Additionally, several of the regime's key military officers face drug charges, including current Interior Minister Néstor Reverol; former Deputy Director of the National AntiDrugs Office Edilberto Molina; and former DGCIM Chief Hugo Carvajal, who was recently arrested in Spain despite breaking away from the regime in previous months.
U.S. investigators also are going after two of Mr. Maduro's high-ranking officials: Diosdado Cabello, president of the National Constituent Assembly, and Tareck El Aissami, industry minister. Both have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department, which accuses them of aiding extensive drug trafficking operations in Venezuela.
Mr. El Aissami also has been the target of wide-ranging investigations by his own country's intelligence agency into his ties to the criminal underworld, The New York Times reported.
According to U.S. officials, members of the regime - including Mr. El Aissami and Mr. Cabello - as well as other military personnel run the Cartel of the Suns, a criminal organization that controls the country's drug trafficking operations.
Mr. Guaidó has promised - and the White House has hinted - that amnesty would be offered for any past crimes for those who abandon the regime and help get rid of Mr. Maduro.
But so far there have been no takers from the top echelon, despite promises made during recent negotiations with Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López and Supreme Court Chief Maikel Moreno to do so, as publicly stated by Mr. Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton.
Also complicating matters is the expertise provided by Cuba's security apparatus on how to weed out any dissension from the military ranks. Most officers are under constant watch by the DGCIM or members of the Cuban intelligence, which have infiltrated bases across Venezuela. U.S. officials have said that as many as 20,000 Cuban military personnel are actively engaged with the Venezuelan military, a claim Cuba has vehemently denied.
The environment of fear is fed by the high risk of arrest and personal torture that each plotter might face as well as the threat of arrest and torture of family members, a practice that has been on the rise in recent years as Mr. Maduro's unpopularity grows, according to Human Rights Watch and other o

Texto completo: Your TV GPS, Globe critic Matthew Gilbert's guide to what's on television, appears at the beginning of each week at BostonGlobe.com. This column covers May 6-12.
THE END OF THE ROAD FOR 'VEEP'
Some feel that “Veep" passed its freshness date the day that Donald Trump trumped the writers by becoming president. Others feel the HBO comedy hasn't been as sharp since creator Armando Iannucci left after season 4, to be replaced by David Mandel.
To me, the show has certainly changed across its seven seasons, but it has remained top-quality throughout. I will remember it as one of the best modern comedies TV has offered, in the same category as “30 Rock," “Parks and Recreation," and “The Office." And I will remember it as the best TV show about politics thus far in the history of TV, comedy or drama.
Whether it's focusing on the absurdities of American politics or the brutal and profane self-interest of Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Selina Meyer and her staff, it has remained not only cruelly funny but a look into the peculiar art of failing up.
I'd love to be able to say that, as fool on the Hill Jonah Ryan finds support in his presidential run, or as slimy Dan Egan keeps getting fired from jobs, “Veep" has crossed over into pure silly farce with no connection to reality. I'd love to say that the show has turned its sights away from political satire and toward sitcom ridiculousness.
But have you watched a 24-hour cable news channel lately?
What will the phenomenal Louis-Dreyfus do next? I can't wait to find out. The “Veep" finale is on Sunday at 10:50 p.m.
WHAT I'M WATCHING THIS WEEK
1. You won't find a limited TV series much more grueling than HBO"s “Chernobyl," a five-parter that premieres on Monday at 9 p.m. It's a look at the 1986 nuclear disaster in the Soviet Ukraine, and in particular how the Kremlin repeatedly chose to ignore science for political reasons, just as certain governments currently choose to ignore climate change science. But it's a well-made and essential cautionary tale about the culture of disinformation, featuring fine performances by Jared Harris and Emily Watson as the scientists. (Here's my review.)
2. Every year, social media plotzes over the drag that celebrities wear to the annual Met Gala, a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Birds of Paradise, Peacocks, Puffins, and Macaws, they all come strutting down the red carpet, their chests forward and their plumage freshly groomed. It's a parade of pretty people in gawky frocks. This year's red carpet event, on Monday, will air live on E! starting at 5 p.m.
3. Old friends meet up for a birthday event vacation in Napa Valley and things go awry. But really who cares because: Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Tina Fey, Paula Pell, and Maya Erskine from “PEN15." The movie “Wine Country," directed by Poehler, is available Friday on Netflix.
4. As musical guests the Jonas Brothers might put it, I'm a sucker for you, Dame Emma Thompson. She'll host “Saturday Night Live" this week.
5. Former FBI director James Comey is marking the second anniversary of his firing by President Trump by having a CNN town hall, moderated by Anderson Cooper. Will he be asked about his recent op-ed in the New York Times in which he described how Trump's amorality sparks the worst in those around him, such as Attorney General William Barr? As he put it, “Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites." The town hall is Thursday at 8 p.m.
6. “State of the Union" follows Louise and Tom — played by Rosamund Pike and Chris O'Dowd — as they meet in a pub before their weekly marital therapy sessions. Each of the 10 episodes is only 10-15 minutes long, and they air nightly for the next two weeks at 10 p.m. on Sundance. Crucial quality-related information: Author Nick Hornby wrote the series, and Stephen Frears — “The Grifters," “The Queen," “A Very English Scandal" — directed it.
7. Two documentary series feature familiar Massachusetts stories this week. On Tuesday at 10 p.m., ABC's “1969" will dig into the case of Mary Jo Kopechne and Senator Ted Kennedy. And then on Saturday at 9 p.m., Reelz's “Real Story Of . . ." will feature the Boston Strangler case.
8. The British podcast “My Dad Wrote a Porno," in which Jamie Morton shares the amateur erotic novels his father writes under the pen name Rocky Flintstone, is getting a TV special. HBO is airing a live show filmed in London, on Saturday at 10 p.m.
9. Think “Lord of the Flies" or “Survivor," as a group of teens are mysteriously transported to a facsimile of their New England town and fight to survive. The 10-episode first season of “The Society," due Friday on Netflix, stars Kathryn Newton and is written by Chris Keyser (“Tyrant," “Party of Five") and directed by Marc Webb (“500 Days of Summer," “The Amazing Spider-Man").
CHANNEL SURFING
“Lucifer"
After getting canceled by Fox, the fourth season arrives in a new home. Netflix, Wednesday
“Into the Badlands"
The series finale. AMC, Monday, 10 p.m.
“Sneaky Pete"
Giovanni Ribisi is back as the con man for the third season. Amazon, Friday
“Modern Family"
It's the 10th-season finale as Hayley and Dylan's twins aproach. ABC, Wednesday, 9 p.m.
“Klepper"
Jordan Klepper tries again with a docu-series that takes him on the road to meet activists. Comedy Central, Thursday, 10:30 p.m.
SO LONG, FAREWELL
This is a year of major goodbyes. What else is leaving soon, in addition to “Veep"?
“Game of Thrones" is currently in the middle of the eighth and finale season. But fear not; a few spinoffs are in the works at HBO.
“The Big Bang Theory" will end with an hourlong episode on May 16. The hit CBS show made a star of Jim Parsons, who won four Emmys as Sheldon, during its 12-season run.
“Orange Is the New Black" is leaving after the seventh season, which premieres on Netflix a little later this year. At first a revelation, with its diverse cast and its many individual storylines, the show has lost some spark.
“Homeland" is bidding goodbye later this year, with its eighth season. The Showtime drama was originally meant to begin airing in June, but due to international location shooting, it has been moved.
“Transparent," the groundbreaking Amazon series, is ending later this year with a two-hour musical. Show creator Jill Soloway described it as “Jesus Christ Superstar" meets “La La Land" meets “Flight of the Conchords" meets “Yentl."
Other forthcoming departures: “Elementary," “The Affair," “Jane the Virgin," “Mr. Robot," “The Deuce"

WOODY ALLEN HAS A BOOK TO SELL BUT NO ONE'S BUYING

Texto completo: It's not surprising that Woody Allen would want to tell the world his life's story, how he grew up a lower-class Jewish boy in Brooklyn to become a comedian, writer, actor and one of the most acclaimed American directors of the second half of the 20th century.
Presumably, the 83-year-old would spin humorous anecdotes about working as a comedy writer in 1950s TV, and then about how he broke into stand-up, Broadway and films, eventually directing such classics as "Annie Hall," "Manhattan" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors." Maybe Allen would discuss being influenced by Charlie Chaplin and Ingmar Bergman and share memories of working with such A-list stars as Diane Keaton, Kate Winslet, Scarlett Johansson and Penélope Cruz.
Allen's memoir would cover key moments of culture in the past seven decades, so it could be a useful historical document.
But no major publisher wants to touch it, reports The New York Times. Executives at four major publishing houses told the Times that the director has a finished manuscript that he has been shopping around in the last year, but he has not received any offers to publish it.
Some executives used the word "toxic" when describing the challenges of working with Allen in a post-#MeToo era, the Times reported.
Over the past two years, Allen's reputation has taken a major hit over resurfaced allegations that he molested his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7 years old. Allen has denied the allegations, which were first promoted by his ex-girlfriend Mia Farrow after their nasty breakup in 1992. The allegations never led to criminal charges or conviction.
But #MeToo supporters have taken up the cause of believing Dylan Farrow, as Hollywood and other industries have faced a reckoning over widespread sexual harassment and assault. Allen's fiercest critics include his son Ronan Farrow, the New Yorker writer who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on sexual misconduct allegations against other powerful men in Hollywood, particularly Harvey Weinstein and Leslie Moonves.

Texto completo: "Cry havoc," goes the line from Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," "and let slip the dogs of war."
In the case of some celebrated American pooches, the phrase can be taken literally.
Each major war seemed to produce a storied dog whose bravery and devotion made for a stirring tale. Jack was a mastiff who followed the Confederates around in the Civil War, but wisely changed sides when his unit was defeated. Katie for the Korean War. Chips for World War II. Nemo for the Vietnam War.
World War I had two famous war dogs. There was Rags, a stray picked up in Paris, known for his ability to detect incoming shells and identify broken telephone wire. He became famous, garnering write-ups in the New York Times and making parade appearances. But he was never nominated for a rank.
Not only was a foundling terrier named Stubby given a rank, but he was promoted. Sergeant Stubby was the most decorated dog of World War I. Like Rags, Stubby was a stray, and fell in with some soldiers drilling in New Haven, Conn. Cpl. Robert Conroy decided to bring Stubby to France when they shipped out, and smuggled him under his coat. A senior officer discovered the ruse. But, as the story goes, Stubby gave the officer a salute, as Conroy had taught him. Stubby stayed.
Stubby joined the 102nd Infantry Regiment, where he saw action in four offenses and 17 battles. Barrages day and night for over a month. He was wounded by a hand grenade and gassed, after which he wore a mask, and learned to use his exquisite sense of smell to alert the troops to deadly vapors.
He found wounded soldiers in the No Man's Land between the enemy lines, and -- again, because of his superhuman sense of hearing -- learned to associate the whine of incoming artillery so he could warn the soldiers to take shelter.
There's a story of Stubby finding a spy while out on patrol. He smelled something in the bushes, ran off, and was discovered with his teeth deep in the hindquarters of a German soldier snooping on the Americans.
The soldier wore an Iron Cross when captured. The Yanks relieved him of the medal, and pinned it on Stubby's vest. For this valorous act, Gen. "Black Jack" Pershing reportedly promoted Stubby to Sergeant, which meant he outranked some of the troops who accompanied him on his surveillance missions. (Anyone who's walked a headstrong dog knows the feeling.)
Stubby was wounded again by a grenade, but survived. So did Robert Conroy, who brought him home, once again snuggled in his coat. After the war Stubby appeared in parades, wearing the medal-spangled vest made for him by grateful survivors of the liberation of Chteau-Thierry.
Conroy returned to civilian life, attending Georgetown Law School. Stubby accompanied him there, as well, and found new duty as the football team's mascot. At halftime he would trot out on the field and play with the pigskin. Fun, but probably not as much fun as chomping spy butt.
He was 10 years old when he died in his sleep in 1926. He was stuffed by a taxidermist and interred, off and on, behind a glass case at the Smithsonian, where he stares out at 21st-century gawkers with the expression of someone who learned to accept everything, to like very little of it, and count the quiet moments of safety and satiation as the best life can provide.

Doggone discourse would be better focused on real problems

Texto completo: Boy, is our political discourse going to the dogs.
The Washington Post reports Donald Trump is the first U.S. president in 100-plus years not to have a dog — though others, including Ronald Reagan, didn't have dogs until their second terms. During a February rally, reports The Post, Trump said "he doesn't have a dog because the idea of getting one seems 'phony' to him." Using presidential pets to score political points is not without precedent. The Hill says "avid dog lover" Herbert Hoover was among the first to do so while running for the nation's highest office.
"Following campaign advice, with hopes of shaping his image into something warmer and more charismatic, he released a photograph of himself with his German Shepherd, King Tut," says The Hill.
King Tut helped Hoover win the White House, but after he presided over the 1929 stock-market crash, Hoover was routed by FDR in the 1932 presidential election. According to The Hill, some suggested Bill Clinton got Buddy, his beloved chocolate Labrador, to help his image at the peak of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Maybe so, but photos clearly show Clinton enjoyed Buddy's company. George H.W. and Barbara Bush had Millie, an English springer spaniel who famously birthed six White House puppies. Millie's book was a huge seller. Their presidential son had a dog, too. "President George W. Bush's Scottish terrier, Barney, became a celebrity in his own right, appearing in more than 10 films while he was at the White House," says The Hill. The Obama family chose Portuguese water dogs Bo and Sunny, in part because Malia Obama required a hypoallergenic breed. The canines brought joy to the Obama family and were a delight at various White House events. But no dog for the Trumps? "Ever since President William McKinley's administration — which began in 1897 — every single occupant of the White House, save for Trump, has had a dog at some point," reports The Post.
Trump said he'd feel odd walking a dog on the White House lawn and just doesn't have the time to do so. And that resulted in a loud negative response, in these over-charged times, that the current occupant of the White House loathes all things canine.
"WHY DOES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HATE DOGS?" asks Newsweek.
"Instead of having dogs, which tend to crave attention and often are scene stealers where photography is involved," Newsday columnist Anne McFeatters tells us, "Trump frequently calls women he disdains 'a dog.'" In a New York Times column, Timothy Egan writes: "We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs." The "Trump hates dogs" narrative got to a point in which it prompted fact-checking website Snopes to investigate whether Trump's critics are barking up the wrong tree. Snopes' conclusion?
"The claim that he 'hates dogs' appears to be based on shaky logic ... and relatively scant evidence ... . It is also contradicted by photographic evidence and first-hand accounts of Trump's cheerful demeanor around dogs."
Like or dislike Trump — goodness knows he evokes powerful passions among supporters and opponents alike — it's troubling to me that so much ink and bandwidth would be spent on so trivial a subject, when so many matters of larger importance are begging for our attention. Just another sign that our political discourse is really going to the dogs.

Texto completo: Saturday marks Star Wars Day, chosen on May 4 because of its play on words with the classic line "May the Force be with you."
Fans of Star Wars have a lot to look forward to this year, as the next film "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" will hit theaters this December.
Fans can celebrate in a variety of ways, including catching up on their favorite Star Wars flicks, or reading their favorite books. They can also take time to remember Peter Mayhew. The actor who played Chewbacca in the original trilogy, "The Revenge of the Sith" and "The Force Awakens," died Tuesday at the age of 74.
There's also plenty to do on your phones and video game consoles, with several apps and games to help you enjoy #Maythe4th. Here's a look at some fun techy ways to celebrate:
The official Star Wars app The official app has everything a Star Wars fan would want right on their phone. Users can watch official videos or track the latest news on the franchise. Custom weather reports will tell you whether it "feels like Endor" or another planet in Star Wars lore. There's also Star Wars themed GIFs, emojis and even a Force Trainer game to unleash your inner Jedi.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes This strategy game for iOS and Android devices lets players assemble a team of Star Wars heroes and villains from across every era and compete in epic battles.

Texto completo: In keeping with Will Rogers' quip – "A difference of opinion is what makes horse racing and missionaries" – here follows an arbitrary, arguable and unlikely-to-create-converts list of the top 10 names of Kentucky Derby horses:
10. American Eagle Jockey Club rules prohibit the recycling of the names of Kentucky Derby winners, but the names of also-rans are often available. American Eagle is the only name bestowed on two different Derby horses. The first American Eagle was the first Derby mount of Hall of Fame jockey Earle Sande in 1918. The second, in 1944, was the only Derby mount of Jess Higley. Both American Eagles finished last.
9. Die Hard In early 1959, both Die Hard and Bruce Willis were 3-year-olds. "Die Hard" the film would propel Willis to stardom and has spawned four sequels. Die Hard the horse finished 16th in a field of 17 in the 1959 Derby. Yippee ki-ay.
8. Johnstown In 1939, the 50th anniversary of the catastrophic Johnstown Flood, a bay colt bearing the Pennsylvania town's name became the second of four horses to win the Derby by eight lengths, still the largest margin of victory in the history of the race. Two of the four eight-length winners – Whirlaway (1941) and Assault (1946) – went on to win the Triple Crown.
7. Thirty Six Red Named for the highest number on a roulette wheel, Thirty Six Red was Mike Smith's second Derby mount and finished an uninspired ninth in 1990. Which brings us to one of the Jockey Club's more arcane rules for naming thoroughbreds: Names consisting entirely of numbers are prohibited, but numbers above thirty may be used if they are spelled out.
6. Col. Hogan Remember "Hogan's Heroes?" Shortly after Sgt. Schultz (John Banner) celebrated his first birthday in Vienna, a long shot called Col. Hogan finished 15 lengths behind the next-worst horse in the 1911 Derby. As television's Col. Hogan (Bob Crane) said in another context, "I have a plan that has no right to work, but let's give it a try anyway."
5. American Pharoah Memorably misspelled, the 2015 Triple Crown winner invoked owner Ahmed Zayat's Egyptian roots, but the name was actually suggested by a registered nurse from Missouri, Marsha Baumgartner. Playing off the name of the colt's sire, Pioneerof the Nile, and his Dam's sire, Yankee Gentlemen, Baumgartner submitted her entry in an online naming contest conducted by Zayat Stables. "I don't remember how I spelled it; I don't want to assign blame," she told the New York Times, but added, "I looked up the spelling before I entered."
4. Silky Sullivan Known as a late closer and famous for lagging far behind the field, Silky Sullivan went off as co-favorite in the 1958 Derby with the great Bill Shoemaker in the saddle. But in the withering words of the race summary, he reached the final turn and "made only a brief and ineffectual bid of less than one-sixteenth mile and refused to extend himself thereafter." (The author is no relation to the horse, though he has sometimes been described as a part of equine anatomy.)
3. Macbeth II The 1888 Derby winner was a gelding, emasculated literally as Shakespeare's Macbeth was figuratively. But at the urging of jockey George Covington, and with what the race summary called a "tremendous finishing kick," Macbeth II screwed his courage to the sticking place and did not fail.
2. Burgoo King Named for Lexington grocer James T. Looney and his renowned regional stew, Burgoo King overtook Economic in the stretch for a five-length victory in the 1932 Derby. Later, Looney began canning his concoction under the name "Burgoo King," including a photo of the Derby winner on the label.
1. Secretariat What's in a name? Syllables, sound, derivation, association. Imagine Chic Anderson's famous call from the 1973 Belmont as, "Sceptre is moving like a tremendous machine." It doesn't quite resonate, does it? But Sceptre was the first of five names the Jockey Club rejected for the transcendent colt ultimately known as Secretariat. Named by Meadow Stables secretary Elizabeth Ham, who had previously worked for an American diplomat, Secretariat still owns the record times for all three Triple Crown races.
Jockey Ron Turcotte guides Secretariat toward the finish line to win the 1973 Kentucky Derby.

Texto completo: President Trump says former FBI Director James Comey "probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying" on his 2016 campaign.
During an interview with Fox News that aired Thursday evening, Trump referred to how Attorney General William Barr recently said "spying did occur" on Trump's presidential team and tied it to Comey, whom he fired from the FBI in May 2017.
"I would say he probably led some kind of an effort. The word 'spying' has been used. He probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying," Trump told Fox News' Catherine Herridge. "I know, we will find out whether it was it could very well be true. We are going to find out pretty soon."
Trump said he would be allowing the declassification of documents "very soon" that could shine light on potential misconduct by federal officials. Trump already ordered certain documents to be declassified last year that relate to the federal Russia investigation, including text messages from Comey.
The prospect of improper "spying" has been a renewed subject of debate since Barr said during a hearing last month that he believed Trump's campaign was subject to surveillance. "The question is whether it was predicated — adequately predicated," Barr testified. "I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane."
Democrats raged at the suggestion, and Comey disagreed with the assessment. "When I hear that kind of language used, it’s concerning because the FBI, the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance,” Comey said at the Hewlett Foundation's Verify Conference. “I have never thought of that as spying.” Although Comey said he gave Barr the benefit of the doubt, citing his long career, his talk of "spying" made it more difficult. "I have no idea what the heck he's talking about," Comey added.
Comey's faith in Barr appears to have weakened after the attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a New York Times op-ed, Comey expressed his astonishment at Barr's defense of the president in the aftermath of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s redacted report on his Russia investigation. “Proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that’s at least part of what we’ve seen with Bill Barr and [Deputy Attorney] Rod Rosenstein. Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from,” he said.
Asked to respond to Comey's opinion piece, Trump disparaged his former top cop, saying he was a "terrible director" who leaked and lied to Congress.
Comey oversaw FBI when the bureau launched a counterintelligence investigation into possible links between Trump's campaign and Russia in the summer of 2016. He testified to Congress that the operation began as an investigation examining a possible "connection" between four Americans and Russia. Although Comey admitted that at least some of these individuals were affiliated with the Trump campaign, he said Trump was not a subject of the investigation.
That counterintelligence was wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which recently wrapped up. Mueller said in his report that his team could not establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, but did not make a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he and Rosenstein determined that there was inconclusive evidence to establish an obstruction crime took place, but Democrats argue Mueller left the question open to Congress to investigate and decide.

Texto completo: The next time you are browsing in the philosophy section of the bookstore, pick up a tome on stoicism, flip to the index, and look under the letter “S.” Don’t be surprised if you spot an entry for “Stockdale, James.”
In many respects, Navy Vice Adm. James Stockdale (1923-2005) was the personification of the all-American hero. A native of Abingdon, Ill., Stockdale never lost his distinctive Midwestern twang. A summary of his life reads like a series of checked boxes: He graduated from the Naval Academy, became first a test pilot and then a fighter pilot, married Sybil — the only wife he would ever have — and fathered four sons.
But an exotic thread entered the fabric of Stockdale’s life during his service in the Vietnam War. In 1965, he piloted a plane felled by the North Vietnamese. Immediately upon being captured and confined, the new prisoner of war, who was introduced to philosophy while pursuing a master’s degree at Stanford University, turned to the teachings of a long-dead Greek guy. As he recounted in a 1995 speech at King’s College, Stockdale whispered the following to himself just before he was hauled off: “Five years down there, at least. I’m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.”
Epictetus’ creed was stoicism. As Stockdale put it in the same speech, stoics were to silo “those things that are 'up to him’ and ... those things that are ‘not up to him,’” mastering the former and tolerating the latter. Harnessing this philosophy, Stockdale navigated his 7-year stint in the Hanoi Hilton. Upon his return to civilization, he received the Medal of Honor and a pair of Purple Hearts.
Today, owing both to his devotion to the philosophy and the unique circumstances under which he field-tested it, Stockdale is something akin to the public face of stoicism, cited in books, articles, videos, and across the internet.
Such was not always the case. In fact, although his experience as a prisoner of war was recounted in a popular 1984 book he co-authored with his wife called In Love and War: The Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam Years, Stockdale first came to the attention of the general public when he served as Ross Perot’s running mate during the 1992 presidential contest. “Who am I? Why am I here?” Those words, Stockdale’s introductory salvo in the vice presidential debate with Al Gore and Dan Quayle, still ring out. The ex-prisoner of war’s performance was judged harshly. The New York Times was condescending, writing, “There was some charm in this 68-year-old who uttered simplicities amid the bombast," while “Saturday Night Live” was willfully ignorant, with Phil Hartman portraying a man of immense learning as a shouting fool. The Washington Post’s David Von Drehle conceded Stockdale’s philosophical bent, but he still concluded, “Last night, officially riding shotgun, he had trouble, it must be said, speaking for himself.”
Then, at some point in the mid-’90s, came a startling reversal: Stockdale, who seemed destined in some quarters to be remembered as a name on lists of “memorable VP debate moments,” began to be cited as a philosophical lodestar. Early on, his defenders came from unlikely corners. Comedian Dennis Miller, for example, went on an impassioned pro-Stockdale tribute during a 1994 stand-up routine. “He’s a brilliant, sensitive, courageous individual,” Miller said. “But he committed the unpardonable sin in our culture: He was bad on television.” In an interview conducted after serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter, “Pulp Fiction” co-screenwriter Roger Avary described Stockdale, whom he had met while working on a planned HBO series about Medal of Honor recipients, as a kind of guiding light. “I cannot stress to you how strong and noble this man was,” Avary said.
Did Miller or Avary know anything of Stockdale before that notorious VP debate? Perhaps they did, but City College of New York philosophy professor Massimo Pigliucci openly admits he did not. “He seemed foolish, but little did I know that Stockdale would become one of my role models, several decades after that night and about ten years after his death,” Pigliucci writes in his 2017 book, How To Be a Stoic, in which Stockdale is discussed alongside such figures as Cato the Younger.
Why were people as diverse as a comedian, a filmmaker, and a professor drawn to Stockdale? For starters, Stockdale’s public sliming was sure to invite independent thinkers to take a second look. What they found, however, was not a garden-variety hero, but a man who framed a wretched experience in unapologetically intellectual terms. Not every soldier imprisoned by the enemy uses the occasion to try out a school of philosophy. Note how, in reeling off adjectives about Stockdale, Miller lists “brilliant” and “sensitive” ahead of “courageous.”
What’s more, Stockdale was serious. Stoicism to him was not a metaphor. His admirers say he meant it. “For Epictetus, emotions were acts of will,” he said at King’s College. “Fear was not something that came out of the shadows of the night and enveloped you; he charged you with the total responsibility of starting it, stopping it, controlling it.”
Taking this to heart, Stockdale steeled himself against physical pain to dole out minimal information to his torturers; personal pride at holding out on some things, if not all things, buoyed Stockdale and the “expatriate colony” of imprisoned officers he led. At such moments, Stockdale said in a documentary, he did not wish to be elsewhere: “When comradeship ran so high, and there was such an affection for each other among us guys who were victims of this thing, I thought to myself, ‘You know, I wouldn’t be anywhere else. I’m right where I should be.’”
Stockdale’s story, then, was not of one man’s exceptional bravery, but of a philosophy of use to anyone with the goal of regulating his own inner life. Indeed, his message could find relevancy even in the world of business, as proven in Jim Collins’ book Good to Great, in which the term “Stockdale paradox” was introduced. The paradox, which has gained traction in business literature, was this: Terrible turns of events cannot be swept under the rug, but they also must not be glumly accepted. “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end, which you can never afford to lose, with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality,” Stockdale told Collins.
Stockdale probably never guessed he would be mentioned in the pages of Forbes and Fast Company. On the other hand, it is a sign of progress in American culture that Stockdale went from getting mocked by those who should know better to getting celebrated by those we wouldn’t necessarily expect to appreciate him.
Maybe his outlook is popular because it offers both toughness and optimism. Maybe those drawn to him reckon that, while they may not have been prisoners of war, they have their own heap of problems, and that those problems ought to be tackled with character and guts rather than handouts from the government or help from Mom and Dad.
Near the end of his speech at King’s College, Stockdale spoke of a message he received from fellow war prisoner Dave Hatcher. Stockdale was recuperating from having slit his own wrists — an act done in preference to going through torture that, due to a note his captors had found, might cause him to implicate those in his “colony” — when he read lines not from Epictetus but from William Ernest Henley. They ended like this: “I am the master of my fate/ I am the captain of my soul.” As his admirers know, these words weren’t an aspiration for James Stockdale. They were a job description.

Texto completo: It was called the Economic Opportunity Act, a measure intended to kick-start the sputtering post-recession economy in New Jersey, particularly in its struggling cities. The state would award lucrative tax breaks to businesses ifthey moved to New Jersey or remained in the state, creating and retaining jobs.
But before the bill was approved by the Legislature, a series of changes were made to its language in June 2013 that were intended to grant specific companies hundreds of millions of dollars in additional tax breaks, with no public disclosure, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times.
Many of the last-minute changes to drafts of the bill were made by a real estate lawyer, Kevin D. Sheehan, whose influential law firm has close ties to Democratic politicians and legislative leaders in New Jersey.
Sheehan was allowed by lawmakers to edit drafts of the bill in ways that opened up sizable tax breaks to his firm's clients, according to a marked-up copy of the legislation obtained by The Times, which identifies Sheehan's changes.
Nearly sixyears later, the fallout from the legislation has set off an uproar in the state Capitol over allegations that the state's $11 billion in economic development programs have been poorly managed corporate giveaways that have brought Few benefits to New Jersey.
One of the clauses added by sheehan to the text of the bill lelped a client, Holtec Inter-lational, an energy technology company, to claim a tax credit of $260 million in 2014 to build a new headquarters at a port in Camden, New Jersey.
The state's analysis at the time indicated that for the $260 million tax credit to Holtec, the net benefit to taxpayers would be tiny: $155,520 in potential benefits for the state over 35 years, including new tax revenue, as well as the creation of 235 new jobs and the retention of 160 jobs.
That is about $650,000 in tax credits for each job.
Another clause that Sheehan inserted into the draft called for a tax credit for a "qualified business facility located in a priority area housing the United States headquarters and related facilities of an automobile manufacturer," the draft of the legislation shows.
That language appeared intended to benefit just one company, Subaru of America, which ended up reaping a $118 million tax credit from the state, according to interviews and documents.
Sheehan, whose role in the drafting of the legislation has not been disclosed before, declined to be interviewed for this article.
His law firm, Parker McCay, said in a statement that it "was asked by policymakers, including those in the Legislature, to review this legislation and offer input and suggestions on ways it could be strengthened."
Sheehan did not register to lobby on the 2013 Economic Opportunity Act, and the firm maintained that its work on the legislation did not amount to lobbying.
The firm said in a statement, "It would be a reckless mischar-acterization of Parker McCay's activities to state that Parker McCay was engaged in unregistered lobbying in 2013."
Parker McCay's chief executive is Philip Norcross, whose brother is George Norcross, an insurance executive who is widely considered the most powerful Democratic political leader in southern New Jersey. Another brother is Donald Norcross, a former Democratic state senator who represented Camden and who is now a U.S. representative.
As a result of the 2013 legislation, George Norcross' insurance firm, Conner Strong & Buckelew, also benefited, receiving approval for an $86.2 million tax credit to relocate to an 18-story office tower in Camden.
In all, under the legislation, the state has granted at least $4.8 billion in tax credits extending well into the future, and it appears that the changes made by Sheehan helped to significantly increase the program's cost.
The bill was approved overwhelmingly by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and signed by the governor at the time, Chris Christie, a Republican, who in recent weeks has contended that the state's economic development programs have been a major success.
Christie and other supporters. of the legislation said the programs were the only way to lure companies to economically depressed areas like Camden, a city of 75,000 on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia.
The Times' findings about how the Economic Opportunity Act was approved were based on interviews with officials, lawmakers, lobbyists, corporate executives and others, as well as an extensive examination of government records.
A task force appointed by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat elected in 2017, is examining whether the economic development programs, including those created under the Economic Opportunity Act, have delivered significant benefits or have been tilted toward helping politically connected firms and companies.
The task force last month referred evidence to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges, though it was not immediately known whether the evidence might lead to charges against anyone.
In January, the state comptroller released a blistering audit that revealed "numerous significant deficiencies" in the state's economic development programs.
The audit found that the tax credits from the 2013 act seemed to fall short of creating as many jobs as promised, and that the state badly managed the program.
The comptroller did not offer a complete analysis of the jobs created or retained by the legislation. But it did raise significant questions about the state's long-standing policy of granting tax breaks.
It found that from 2005 and 2017, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the agency overseeing the tax credits, had approved 401 projects for tax breaks that were projected to create 50,633 new jobs and retain 33,727 jobs.
The comptroller scrutinized a sample of 48 projects during that time period, projected to create more than 8,700 jobs and retain 6,650 jobs. The audit found that it could not substantiate nearly 3,000 jobs the companies said they had created or retained.
"In the end, a lot of companies will make their decisions about where to go, and then kind of game the system to maximize how much in tax credits they can get," said Jon Whiten, the deputy director of state communications at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization in Washington.
"With all the changes that New Jersey made in 2013, the state just sort of surrendered more of the power in that equation to big businesses looking for bigger tax breaks," he said.
Murphy has been an outspoken critic of the state's economic development programs, saying that "a full accounting of how as much as $11 billion was squandered is now required."
He recently demanded the resignation of five members of the Economic Development Authority. (So far, just one member, Larry Downes, the former board chair, has stepped down.)
Christie accused Murphy of "political assassination" over his criticism of the incentives.
"The program works," Christie said at an event last month. "You can't win the philosophical argument, so what you do is you vilify and lie about the program."
Democrats in the Legislature who oversawthe passage of the bill, like Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, have largely defended the program.
"We sought and welcomed the advice of a wide range of people who possess experience and expertise in the many aspects of economic development," Sweeney said. "Their contributions made it a better bill."
He said the legislation had helped to revitalize Camden and other cities. "These are investments that can produce real and lasting improvements."
New Jersey's Election Law Enforcement Commission, which regulates lobbying, declined to comment on Parker McCay or Sheehan's work on the legislation.
The commission said that, in general, "a lobbyist is defined as someone who is compensated to influence legislation, regulations or governmental processes by communicating with or providing a benefit to a high-level state official."
Donald Norcross, who was a sponsor of the bill when he was in the state Senate, said he was not aware of changes made to the legislation.
In a statement, his office said: "Donald Norcross was a champion of the bill, as was every elected official from Camden and virtually every member of the state Legislature. He supported it because he knew it would be good for Camden and the facts are clear that it has been."
Philip Norcross, the chief executive of Parker McCay, declined to comment.
George Norcross, the Democratic political leader, said in a statement that he "was a cheerleader and advocate for Camden for many years prior to the passage" of the 2013 legislation. .
Companies relocating to Camden have been awarded $1.6 billion of the $4.9 billion handed out across the state under the 2013 legislation. The last-minute changes to the bill carved out special bonuses and lenient rules for companies moving there.
Until this week, the Parker McCay website hailed its success in obtaining "hundreds of millions of dollars" in tax credits. It said one of its clients that earned tax credits in Camden was an "automobile manufacturer."
But after Parker McCay was contacted by The Times about the 2013 legislation, that section of the law firm's website disappeared.

You Can’t Tax the Rich Without the IRS

The hot policy in Democratic circles these days is raising taxes on the rich. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a plan to tax “ultramillionaires,” as she calls them. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to expand the estate tax. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated raising the top income tax rate to 70% for those making over $10 million a year.
But before this country raises taxes, it should grapple with something much more prosaic but equally important for tackling inequality: saving the Internal Revenue Service.
Already, wealthy people and corporations easily get around today’s rules. However tough any new laws might seem, they’d soon be undercut.
Slowly and quietly over the past eight years, the IRS has been eviscerated. It’s lost tens of thousands of employees. It has fewer auditors now than at any time since 1953. In real dollars, the agency’s budget has dropped by almost $3 billion since 2010.
Businesses and the wealthy benefit the most from this state of affairs. The largest corporations in America used to be audited every year. That started to change when the cuts began, and today, the audit rate has fallen by half. It’s a similar story for individuals making $10 million or more a year: With twice the chance of escaping IRS scrutiny, the ultrarich are much less likely to lose at the game of audit roulette.
Fixing the problem will require more than increasing the IRS’ budget (though that would certainly help). It’s about having the right personnel with the right skills. Today, the wealthy and corporations have the IRS outgunned. The ultra-affluent — with the help of legions of tax professionals — make domestic income disappear overseas or hide it in a pyramid of partnerships. It’s like trying to take on a modern army while armed with spears and clubs.
The IRS has difficulty tracing the income of the superwealthy or countering their sophisticated arguments about why what appears to be one type of income is actually something else. The agency has also trouble valuing their assets (a problem that, as The New York Times revealed, dates back at least to when Fred Trump was misleading the IRS about how much his buildings were worth). By the public admission of numerous IRS officials, it has long done a poor job of scrutinizing complicated partnerships to understand who owns what portion of what stock.
Talk to Us
How Are Things at the IRS? Help Us Get the Real Story.
ProPublica would like to hear from people who have worked at the Internal Revenue Service or are otherwise knowledgeable about tax enforcement.
The top 0.5% of highest-earning Americans account for about a fifth of the income that’s hidden from the IRS, according to one University of Michigan study, or more than $50 billion a year in today’s dollars.
It’s much easier to enforce the tax laws for the bottom 90% of earners. Wages are reported straight to the IRS, and computers can easily check that tax returns accurately report that income. This means that inadequate enforcement of the tax laws necessarily has a regressive effect, liberating those at the top from scrutiny while the masses continue to be tracked by machines.
With its budget slashed, the IRS has pulled back across the board — except for one area where it’s been easier to keep the numbers from falling so much: audits of the poor. More than one-third of all audit targets are recipients of the earned income tax credit, one of the nation’s largest anti-poverty programs. By the hundreds of thousands, IRS computers spit out letters that require low-income taxpayers to prove their eligibility. The counties with the highest audit rates aren’t found in the hedge fund precincts of Connecticut or the lobbyist enclaves of Northern Virginia. No, they’re rural, mostly African American counties in the Deep South.
There’s nothing easy about auditing the rich. Even when the IRS has evidence of flat-out cheating, such as when it discovers a hidden Swiss bank account, it can take years of work to prove its case. Taking such time clashes with one of the core ways the IRS evaluates its managers and agents: how efficiently they open and close audits. As one senior manager put it to us, “If you’re not churning out the exams, you have to explain why you’re not.”
But more often, the affairs of the superwealthy are infernally complicated and the IRS doesn’t have black-and-white proof of evasion. Instead, the agency runs up against what’s called “aggressive” planning in the tax world. To the rich, a tax return is just an opening offer to the government. If they don’t get audited, that’s great. If they do, well, they’re ready for a fight.

How the IRS Was Gutted
An eight-year campaign to slash the agency’s budget has left it understaffed, hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment. The result: billions less to fund the government. That’s good news for corporations and the wealthy.
In 2009, the IRS decided to take a bold, new approach to auditing the superwealthy. The agency’s idea was to bring specialists together and form a kind of green-eyeshade-wearing Delta Force. It would finally do something it — surprisingly — hadn’t been doing before: look at the entirety of a taxpayer’s empire. That meant examining how his partnerships, limited liability companies, foundations, gifts and overseas operations interact with one another. The ultrarich weave all these together so they end up with an ultralow effective tax rate. “We hadn’t really been looking at it all together, and shame on us,” Steven Miller, a former acting commissioner of the IRS, told us.
Because of budget cuts and lobbying, this elite force never came together. The agency hoped to have a staff of about 240 expert auditors by 2012. But by 2014 it had 96, and by last year the number had fallen to 58. Initially spooked by the group’s ambition, tax professionals who counsel the wealthy now speak of the effort with a kind of pity.
Criminal tax enforcement has also faltered. More than 150 million income tax returns were filed in 2017, but the IRS brought fewer than 800 cases in which someone was charged with making legal income but criminally evading taxes. That’s one reason tax cheats can get away with brazen behavior for so long — until they attract the attention of federal investigators for other reasons. That’s what happened to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, and the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, who was charged with failing to file taxes at all for several years. (Avenatti denies the charges.)
So, what to do? One 2020 candidate already has a bold proposal to resuscitate the IRS. It’s a plan to pump tens of billions into the agency, enough to fund a second army of agents. That candidate’s name is Donald Trump.
Of course, it was Trump’s party that gutted the agency, costing the country, we estimate, more than $100 billion in lost revenue. The president’s 2020 budget, however, did propose adding $15 billion over 10 years to the IRS enforcement budget, a move that would more than double the agency’s overall budget. The administration estimated this would produce revenue of at least $47 billion. The question arises: Has the administration genuinely had a change of heart? Or is this merely a neat trick to make deficit projections appear smaller?
So far, this is all just talk. It is, though, one of the few areas where Trump and Democrats are in substantive agreement. Democrats in the House recently proposed a $400 million IRS budget increase next year.
Among the Democratic presidential candidates, Warren does mention the IRS in her wealth tax proposal. She calls for an unspecified but “significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget” and a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to her “ultramillionaire” tax.
Raising taxes on the rich is a more compelling cause than increasing the operating budget of a bureaucracy most American voters probably hate thinking about. But the boldest tax plan of all starts with salvaging the IRS.

Disney, Sinclair have $10.6 billion deal for 21 regional sports networks

Resumen: Sinclair Broadcast Group will get 21 regional sports networks in markets such as Detroit, LA and Miami from Disney in a deal valued at $10.6 billion.

Texto completo: The nation’s largest broadcaster has just made a major sports play, acquiring 21 regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. in a deal valued at $10. 6 billion.
Sinclair Broadcast Group, based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, will get the 21 sports networks and Fox College Sports, assets that Disney had acquired in July 2018 as part of its $71 billion bid for a collection of Twenty-First Century Fox’s assets.
But the Justice Department required Disney to sell the networks to gain the merger’s overall approval, saying the addition of these networks to ESPN would give it too much power and likely result in higher prices for consumers.
The networks acquired include Fox Sports West/Prime Ticket (it broadcasts UCLA, USC, Los Angeles Chargers, and Los Angeles Clippers), Fox Sports Detroit (Detroit Tigers, Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Lions, Detroit Pistons, Michigan State University and University of Michigan) and Fox Sports Florida (Miami Heat, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Miami Dolphins, Tampa Bay Rays, Florida Marlins, University of Miami, Florida State University), and Fox Sports Ohio/SportsTime Ohio (Cleveland Cavaliers, Cincinnati Reds, Ohio State University).
Disney has already reportedly sold one of the networks the YES Network, which broadcasts the New York Yankees, for about $3. 5 billion to a collective including the Yankees, Sinclair and Amazon, The New York Times reported in March.
Sinclair said it would pay $9. 6 billion, after adjusting for minority equity interests. The networks will be part of a new subsidiary Diamond Sports Group, which will gain Entertainment Studios CEO Byron Allen as an equity and content partner.
The deal, which will require DOJ approval, "is a very exciting transaction for Sinclair," CEO and president Chris Ripley said in a statement. "While consumer viewing habits have shifted, the tradition of watching live sports and news remains ingrained in our culture. As one of the largest local news producers in the country and an experienced producer of sports content, we are ideally positioned to transfer our skills to deliver and expand our focus on greater premium sports programming. "
Industry observers had expected the price tag for the networks to reach as high as $20 billion. If these prices are accurate, the networks are fetching a lower price than analysts anticipated, said Tuna Amobi, an equity analyst at CFRA Research.
“With regional footprints that traverse several major U. S. markets, the RSNs had been expected to fetch a much higher valuation, after a seemingly competitive months-long auction that attracted several other potential bidders,” he wrote in an investor note Friday.
Regardless, the stations will complement Sinclair’s online sports channel and Tennis Channel, which it acquired in 2016, and its 24-7 sports channel Stadium, which is broadcast and can also be watched online, Amobi says. Despite stressors such as cord-cutting in the “pay-TV ecosystem,” he said, “we see a relatively steady dual revenue stream (subscription and advertising) that could bode well for Sinclair's long-term return on investment. ”
This acquisition would likely lessen the pain from Tribune Media nixing its $3. 9 billion sale of 42 TV stations to Sinclair after Federal Communications Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency had "serious concerns" about Sinclair unlawfully continuing to control some stations it would have to divest to gain the deal's approval.
That would have grown Sinclair to 215 TV stations; it currently has 191.

Kevin McCarthy: Democrats would be 'stupid' if they tried to impeach Barr

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., warned congressional Democrats against making any attempt to remove Attorney General William Barr from the Justice Department.
Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, where he was grilled on his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's federal Russia investigation report. He was due to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but refused to be interviewed by staff lawyers for the panel as opposed to the lawmakers themselves, a format pushed by Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
That's led to musing among some House Democrats that Barr should be impeached. While that would take only a House majority vote, two-thirds of senators would have to vote to remove Barr, a near-impossibility in the current GOP-majority chamber.
"I think they'd be stupid. I don't understand the reason why. Listen, when you sit back and look at what Nadler did yesterday. I think they were so pent up on trying to impeach the president that they're not thinking through what they are doing," McCarthy told the Washington Post during a live event. "Does Nadler not believe his own members are sharp enough? Does he believe those 18 attorneys are not sharp enough?"
Barr's conflict with Congress coincides with a news story reporting that Mueller complained last month to Barr that his four-page memo about the special counsel's report “did not fully capture the context” of his findings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ratcheted up criticism of Barr on Thursday, alleging that he lied to Congress and that would be a crime if committed by anybody other than the attorney general.
McCarthy, instead, praised Barr for doing "a tremendous job" as the country's top law enforcement officer.
In a wide-ranging interview, McCarthy reiterated calls for House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to step down, jokingly citing liberal HBO host Bill Maher's recent description of Schiff as "a stalker" in his management of his panel's probes into President Trump and the administration.
But while McCarthy said Thursday that the country needed to move on from the Russia inquiry, he also voiced his support of Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., for making criminal referrals to the Justice Department regarding possible political bias within the agency.
McCarthy on Thursday additionally indicated his caucus would try to force a vote addressing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel, similar to a measure passed by the Senate in February with 77 votes. At the same time, he told the audience he would not take any action reinstating Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, to his old committee assignments.
"Not this term, no," McCarthy said.
King, a nine-term lawmaker, was stripped of his responsibilities in January amid the fallout over disputed comments he made to the New York Times about white supremacy, white nationalism, and Western civilization.

Death by organ donation: Euthanizing patients for their organs gains frightening traction

Texto completo: How should society respond to the increasingly long list of people waiting for organs on a transplant list? You’ve no doubt heard of “black market” organs in foreign countries, but are there other options that should be off the table?
If you were on a transplant list, would it matter to you if the organ was obtained from a living person who died because of the donation procedure itself? What if she had volunteered?
Your thoughts on this topic have implications beyond the issue of transplantation.
As the former co-director of Vanderbilt University’s lung transplant program and a practicing intensive care unit physician, I see organ donation an selfless gift to those approaching death on transplant wait lists.
However, I’m wrestling with the emerging collision between the worlds of transplantation and euthanasia.
Cause of death: organ donation?
At international medical conferences in 2018 and 2019, I listened as hundreds of transplant and critical care physicians discussed “donation after death. ” This refers to the rapidly expanding scenario in Canada and some Western European countries whereby a person dies by euthanasia, with a legalized lethal injection that she or he requested, and the body is then operated on to retrieve organs for donation.
At each meeting, the conversation unexpectedly shifted to an emerging question of “death by donation” — in other words, ending a people’s lives with their informed consent by taking them to the operating room and, under general anesthesia, opening their chest and abdomen surgically while they are still alive to remove vital organs for transplantation into other people.
Read more commentary:
I lost my husband to cancer. I’m forever thankful he didn’t choose assisted suicide.
I didn't want heavy painkillers after surgery — but my hospital pushed opioids on me anyway
Patients love a miracle, but doctors can't be afraid to deliver bad news (even via robot)
The big deal here is that death by donation would bypass the long-honored dead donor rule, which forbids removal of vital organs until the donor is declared dead. Death by donation would, at present, be considered homicide to end a life by taking organs.
The mechanics of obtaining organs after death from either euthanasia or natural cardiac death (both already legalized in Canada, Belgium and Netherlands) can be suboptimal for the person receiving the transplant, because damage occurs to organs by absence of blood flow during the 5 to 10 minutes-long dying process. This interval is called ischemia time. Death by donation purports to offer a novel solution. Instead of retrieving organs after death, organ removal would be done while organs are still being receiving blood. There would be no ischemia time and organ removal would be the direct and proximate cause of death.
Unintended, unavoidable consequences
Recently, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published an article by two Canadian physicians and an ethicist from Harvard Medical School, who contended it might be ethically preferable to ignore the dead donor rule if patients declare they want to die in order to donate their organs.
While literally “giving yourself” to others might seem commendable at first glance, let’s discuss three downstream considerations to abandoning the dead donor rule.
►People with physical and mental disabilities have expressed that they feel stigmatized and that society devalues their lives. Would this send them a not-so-subtle message to get out of the way and do something noble with their healthy organs?
►How quickly would we see expansion whereby those who can’t speak for themselves are included as donors?
►What does it mean for all of us when our healers — physicians — are in a position that directly overrides nearly 2,500 year-long prohibitions against taking life?
Consider the case of Ben Mattlin, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy. In a 2012 column for the New York Times, he wrote of the “thin and porous border between coercion and free choice” for those who feel devalued. On the subtle erosion of his autonomy, he wrote: “You also can’t truly conceive of the many subtle forces (to die) — invariably well meaning, kindhearted, even gentle, yet as persuasive as a tsunami — that emerge when your physical autonomy is hopelessly compromised. ”
Civil society is measured by how we treat our most vulnerable members. Euthanasia laws are structured to protect vulnerable populations, but what are the facts?
Murder by any other name
According to a 2015 article in the NEJM, of the 3,882 deaths due to physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia in Flanders, Belgium, in the year 2013 alone, 1,047 (27%) were due to medication dosages to hasten death without patients’ consent. Such patients are generally unconscious and may or may not have family members around.
In 2014, a statement on end-of-life decisions by the Belgian Society of Intensive Care Medicine asserts that "shortening the dying process" should be permissible "with use of medication . . . even in absence of discomfort. ” When discussing these facts, two prominent physicians, one from the Netherlands and another from Harvard, told me that where they come from, they call that murder.
When physicians are participating in a procedure designed to take a person’s life, will patients feel 100% certain that their physician is firmly on the side of healing? What message does it send about the value of every human life when physicians endorse the exchange of one life for another? What affect has it already had on physicians complicit in such death-causing procedures?
In the 1973 science fiction classic "Soylent Green," detective Frank Thorn searches for answers to dying oceans and a deteriorating human race on overcrowded Earth. He discovers the high-protein green food produced by the Soylent Corporation is recycled, euthanized humans. “Soylent Green is people!” he screams.
"Soylent Green" was set in 2022. We are three years away.

Texto completo: The team of lawyers named by Gov. Phil Murphy to investigate New Jersey's controversial tax breaks will follow up its bombshell inaugural meeting, where a whistleblower said her former company lied to win incentives, with more interviews Thursday.
The task force said it plans to interview "several" witnesses in its mission to determine if tax breaks were properly awarded and whether the agency that administers them, the Economic Development Authority, "applied appropriate scrutiny" to incentive applications.
Those key questions have come to the forefront of debate in Trenton since the task force met for the first time in March. A pair of reports Wednesday raised more questions about the integrity of the incentive programs used heavily under Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and passed by Democrats in the Legislature.
The New York Times found that a lawyer with deep connections to Democratic politicians had a hand in writing the tax incentive legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act. That lawyer, Kevin Sheehan, helped edit portions of the bill that opened "sizable" tax breaks to clients of his law firm, Parker McCay.
Earlier Wednesday, a joint WNYC and ProPublica investigation found that two-thirds of the tax break awards in Camden, or more than $1billion, went to companies connected to George Norcross, the powerful unelected Democrat who is allies with Senate President Stephen Sweeney, and business partners and clients of his brother's law firm.
One of Norcross' two brothers, Phil Norcross, is chief executive officer of Parker McCay. Phil Norcross told The Wall Street Journal in an earlier interview that he helped write amendments to the tax break bill. Another brother, Donald Norcross, was a union leader who served in the state Legislature and co-sponsored the bill. He is now a U.S. Representative.
Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by the findings of the two reports.
"Coupled with what we already know about how the tax incentive program operated over the past six years, I believe now more than ever in the importance of the task force I commissioned," Murphy said in a statement. "Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for. If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable."
Norcross issued a lengthy statement Wednesday responding to the WNYC report and even thanked the news outlet for "its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for. As WNYC and other media outlets have reported, the commitment to rebuilding Camden's future began years ago and focused on the city's three biggest challenges: improving public safety, reforming education and bringing jobs and economic investment to the city," Norcross said.
While the Murphy task force and a legislative committee looking into the incentive programs continue their work, Murphy has tried to assert his influence in the debate. He sought the resignation of certain authority board members, but most of them defied him and remain in positions to grant future awards. And Murphy's Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, accused the Democrat of engaging in "political assassination" to gain support for his own incentives.
It does not appear that Murphy plans to apply pressure on the holdout board members, who were named to their seats by Christie.
"They're the government appointees. We approached them, we laid out our case, they made their decision. We have to respect that decision. We don't agree with them," Murphy said last week.
Days later he named Kevin Quinn, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where Murphy worked for two decades, the authority's next board chairman. He replaces Laurence Downes, the only person who stepped down at Murphy's request.
The members of the task force are expected to hear from current and former executives of the authority when they meet Thursday in Newark. The witnesses have been subpoenaed by the task force, according to an announcement of the meeting.
Since it is armed with subpoena authority and includes white-collar crime lawyers, the task force poses perhaps the greatest threat to those who may have abused the tax incentives. At its first meeting, a woman testified that her former company lied to win tax breaks.
The panel has also said it has "obtained robust cooperation" from companies who received tax breaks, including one that admitted it was out of compliance and agreed to repay its grant, saving taxpayers $1.5million. It has also made a criminal referral and said it has uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.
"As we have said, we are going to follow the facts in a search for the truth," said Ronald Chen, chairman of the task force. "Whether that means recertifying companies, seeking voluntary payments and terminations, or making referrals, we plan to be thorough, objective and efficient."
The task force investigating New Jersey's tax incentive programs, shown during its first public hearing March 28 in the Trenton War Memorial, has more interviews with witnesses scheduled Thursday.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "A Rising Tide of Anti-Semitism" (editorial, May 1):
As a reader of The New York Times and, now living abroad, of The International New York Times, I applaud your apology for the horrific political cartoon published in that edition and for coming to terms with your silence of 70-plus years ago.
I am, however, left with a question.
As the adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Will the image and ideas fostered by your publication of the cartoon be so easily erased?
Shulamith Cohn
Jerusalem
To the Editor:
I do not know how you fix anti-Semitism, other forms of religious persecution, racism, misogyny, homophobia or any other extreme prejudice that forms the basis of hatred and ultimately discrimination and violence.
You certainly do not fix it by stoking the lies and images that feed the appetite of such ignorance. I also do not know how a major newspaper apologizes for the kind of anti-Semitic cartoon that it allowed into one of its editions. The Times certainly has not found a way.
You certainly do not blend an apology with general statements about the rise of anti-Semitism. When The Times published the despicable cartoon in question, it forever lent its name to the purveyors of hate and violence directed at Jews the world over. You do not blame a single editor for that and suggest that more sensitivity training is required. The stakes for an important paper like The Times are much higher than that.
The Times should have given this much more thought before it responded as it did. Perhaps it is time to slow down and fully consider the ramifications of what it has allowed to take place under its masthead.
Bruce Neuman
Water Mill, N.Y.
To the Editor:
I stumbled upon the anti-Semitic cartoon you published and cried. I grew up in Belgium in the 1980s, attending Jewish day schools and youth groups, with armed guards protecting us wherever we went. It was normal to us, because, unlike in America, Jews couldn't be Jews in Europe. Not openly.
We envied American Jews, able to walk around with yarmulkes and gather in public. I envied their freedom, their sense of belonging. So I moved to America. Became a citizen, got married, had a child. Certain that my life as a Jew here would be different.
Then, last week, for the first time since I moved here as a young student, it suddenly hit me: There is no escape. This land I so wholeheartedly embraced is just like the homeland that pushed me away.
Even my newspaper pushed me away.

Texto completo: Judge Damon Keith
Damon Keith, one of the most prominent African-American judges on the federal bench, who upheld civil rights and civil liberties in influential rulings that included a 1971 decision barring the Nixon administration from conducting warrantless domestic wiretaps, died Sunday at his home in Detroit. He was 96.
The cause was complications from leukemia and heart disease, said his daughter Cecile Keith Brown.
Keith served in the federal judiciary for more than 50 years beginning in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, named him to the U.S. District Court in Detroit, with jurisdiction over Eastern Michigan. Ten years later, President Jimmy Carter, also a Democrat, elevated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati.
Keith took senior status in 1995 but continued hearing cases, including on secret deportation hearings for alleged terrorists after 9/11. The George W. Bush administration, he declared, had unconstitutionally sought to "uproot people's lives, outside the public eye, and behind a closed door.
"Democracies die behind closed doors, he wrote in the oft-cited 2002 majority opinion.
The case provided a sort of legal bookend to his decision in the civil liberties case during the Nixon administration, which had helped propel him to national attention. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Keith's ruling ordering the government to turn over transcripts of conversations it had recorded in the course of investigating a radical group accused of planning to bomb a CIA office in Michigan.
Keith credited his drive in large part to his father, who worked for $5 a day in a Ford Motor plant and implored his son to go to college. Another important mentor was future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who frequented Howard University when Keith was a law student there in the late 1940s.
"Thurgood would say, When you finish Howard Law, I want you to use the law as a means for social change,' " Keith told The Washington Post in 2016. "That is what I've tried to do in my lifetime.
He venerated the Constitution as a way toward equality for African-Americans who had been excluded from schools, professions, neighborhoods, politics and other arenas of civic life. In 1971, he ordered that about 10,000 of the 24,000 students in the Pontiac, Michigan, public school system be bused to achieve racial integration. It was one of the first such orders in the North.
Shortly before the order took affect, 10 Pontiac school buses were firebombed, a crime for which five Ku Klux Klansmen were later convicted. Keith received death threats.
"I don't scare easily, he told The Washington Post in 2016.
The Supreme Court declined to review the case, allowing busing to proceed.
In 1975, Keith ordered Hamtramck, Michigan, a town neighboring Detroit, to relocate 500 African-Americans who had been displaced from their homes during federally supported urban renewal projects that critics denounced as "Negro removal.
Writing that the city had "ignored their requests for assistance, failed to investigate complaints and in no way compensated such displacees for the loss suffered, he ordered the town to provide the former residents with new, affordable housing.
More than 30 years passed before the housing was built, but when he saw keys exchange hands, "it was meaningful to me as a human being, he told The New York Times in 2010.
Keith endured racism throughout his career - from his time as a janitor at the Detroit News, where a white reporter derisively told him that he should "keep mopping instead of studying for the bar examination, to an incident at a 1991 conference on the Constitution's bicentennial, where he was mistaken for a parking attendant.
In 2016, he wrote a forceful dissent when the federal appellate panel on which he served upheld tighter regulations on absentee and provisional voting ballots in Ohio.
"Rather than honor the men and women whose murdered lives opened the doors of our democracy and secured our right to vote, he wrote, the majority had forsaken the votes of "the most defenseless. Keith included in his decision photographs of civil rights martyrs including Martin Luther King Jr. and lynching victim Emmett Till.
In an interview with Slate magazine, he later denounced "the racist attitude of the majority.
"Look at those pictures, he said of the images he included. "These are men and women who died for the right to vote. I was really so hurt by the decision of the majority of the court. My grandparents lived in Georgia, and they were not allowed to vote because of racism. I thought about them.
Damon Jerome Keith was born in Detroit on July 4, 1922. His parents were from Atlanta, where his father ran small businesses including a general store and a photography studio before migrating north to work for Ford.
"Most kids in my neighborhood did not go to college, the Detroit Free Press later quoted Keith as saying. "Most went to Jackson prison.
His mother's cousin, who was the wife of the president of what was then West Virginia State College, encouraged Keith to enroll at the historically black institution, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1943.
He served in a segregated Army unit during World War II, an experience that drove his interest in the law. "After coming back and having to ride on the back of buses while seeing German soldiers ride in the front, he recalled, "I made up my mind I was going to become a lawyer.
He received a law degree from Howard University in 1949 and a master of laws degree from Wayne State University in Detroit, whose law school today houses the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights.
In the early years of his career, Keith practiced law in Detroit while also holding civic roles including leading the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. In 1953 he married Rachel Boone, a physician. She died in 2007. Survivors include three daughters, Debbie Keith and Gilda Keith, both of Detroit, and Cecile Keith Brown of Chicago; and two granddaughters.
Keith made his most noted ruling in the Nixon administration case involving domestic wiretaps. The administration argued that the government had acted within its lawful authority to protect the country from internal threat, an argument that Keith rejected, as did the Supreme Court, in an 8-to-0 decision citing Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
"History abundantly documents the tendency of government - however benevolent and benign in its motives - to view with suspicion those who most fervently dispute its policies, Justice Lewis Powell Jr. wrote in his decision. "The price of lawful public dissent must not be a dread of subjection to an unchecked surveillance power.
Keith's honors included the Spingarn Medal from the N.A.A.C.P. He was the subject of the 2016 documentary film "Walk With Me: The Trials of Damon J. Keith, directed by Jesse Nesser.
"I really didn't know what kind of judge I'd be, Keith once said, reflecting on his earliest days on the bench. "Putting on the robes can be an awesome responsibility. You have the chance to find out a lot about yourself.

Texto completo: “And thus my suicide began," John L'Heureux wrote, almost as an aside, partway into a final essay published online this week by The New Yorker magazine.
In his lifetime, he wrote more than 20 books — novels, short stories, poetry. Some of his writing drew poignantly on his years in Massachusetts, when he had been a Jesuit priest, and one early short story drew painful inspiration from his father's Parkinson's disease diagnosis — struggles that presaged Mr. L'Heureux's own final illness.
When Mr. L'Heureux died April 22 at age 84, his family announced that the cause was complications of Parkinson's. But in his New Yorker essay “On Death and Dignity," he wrote of discussing with his wife, Joan, and his physicians a decision to end his life April 22 under the death with dignity law in California, where he had been a longtime Stanford University humanities professor.
In the essay, Mr. L'Heureux wrote about the legalities, emotions, and odd details of the process, such as what he would drink to bring on his death: “The concoction would be prepared by a pharmacy licensed to do so, called — can you believe it? — Feel Good Compounders."
He also, perhaps inevitably, wrote about God.
“He is the God of charity and justice," Mr. L'Heureux wrote. “He is the God of compassion and mercy. If I find in myself the need for compassion, to allay suffering and to comfort the living, I feel sure that God has at least as much compassion as I do."
Mr. L'Heureux established his reputation with novels including “A Woman Run Mad" (1988), “The Shrine at Altamira" (1992), and “The Medici Boy" (2014), along with short story collections such as “Comedians" (1990), in which appears the story “Father."
The narrator began by describing his father setting up an easel in the basement to paint. “At the beginning of the end he painted things nobody except himself had ever seen before," Mr. L'Heureux wrote, adding: “But long before we understood what he was doing, our father had begun to escape from us. He was in the process of disappearing."
When Parkinson's disease weakened the title character, his family decided to place him in specialized care, but when they went to tell him, they found a “door stood open to a silver light. He had disappeared. He had escaped, leaving us with all our business incomplete, our goodness, understanding. In the end our father painted clear untroubled air and, quicker than our love, he entered it."
The writer Tobias Wolff, who had studied with Mr. L'Heureux at Stanford, wrote in a tribute posted online by America Magazine, The Jesuit Review, that “in reading his work, one can see, feel, the demands he makes on himself for exactitude, essence, emotional honesty, aesthetic freshness, digging deep for the truths of our thoughts and desires and presenting his findings without flinching, even — no, especially — when they challenge our self-conceptions and certainties, and trouble the heart."
In his 2002 novel “The Miracle," partly set in South Boston, Mr. L'Heureux reminds readers that “people are imperfect, lacking in willpower, infirm in their beliefs, their lives cluttered and unfocused, their character traits largely impervious to change," Bruce Bawerwrote in a New York Times review.
On the opening page, Mr. L'Heureux's protagonist, a parish priest named Father Paul LeBlanc, takes readers on a tour of Southie:
“This is a neighborhood of spruced-up three-deckers — gray and white and tan — with some wood and brick two-deckers, and a few single-family houses with driveways. No matter the color of the houses, they all seem gray when you stand at the corner and look down the street. It is a gray parish. There are a lot of Irish bars — McGillicuddy's, Ahern's, Matt Doherty's — and even the 7-Eleven is run by a guy they call Mahoney. Actually he is Italian, and his name is Meloni, but it sounds Irish when you say it."
John Clarke L'Heureux was born in South Hadley in 1934, a son of Wilfred L'Heureux, an engineer, and Mildred Clarke, a secretary. His father would later die of Parkinson's, his mother of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — ALS.
Mr. L'Heureux would later write for a publisher's website that he also had “an older brother, a civil engineer employed as a lumberjack."
After high school, Mr. L'Heureux attended the College of the Holy Cross and considered becoming an actor. In his essay, Wolff wrote that he gained insight into his teacher's life through the 2010 book “Conversations with John L'Heureux."
In those interviews, Mr. L'Heureux recalled that he was “derailed by Jesus" during his second year at college: “I remember talking with one of my roommates about being an actor, and out of nowhere he said, 'Why don't you become a priest. You're smart enough.' . . . I dismissed what he said as ridiculous, but at the moment he said it, I knew it was going to change my life."
Mr. L'Heureux entered the Jesuit novitiate at Shadowbrook, in the Berkshires. He subsequently graduated with a bachelor's degree from Weston College,according to Stanford, and received master's degrees in philosophy and English from Boston College.
In 1971, after 17 years as a Jesuit, he left the order. “Being a priest was too hard for me," he later said. “I didn't leave because I was disappointed in the Jesuits or in the Church or because I had doctrinal issues. I left because it was too hard to be the kind of priest I wanted to be and it was too important to do any other way."
After leaving the priesthood, he married Joan Polston, a teacher and writer who is his only immediate survivor.
A memorial Mass will be said at 10 a.m. May 25 in St. Albert the Great Church in Palo Alto, Calif.
Before joining Stanford's faculty in 1973, Mr. L'Heureux taught at Georgetown, Tufts, and Harvard universities. He also formerly was editor of the Boston Review.
While still a Jesuit, he began publishing poetry, including one The Atlantic published after the assassination of President John F. Kennedythat ends:
… for the world, darkness.
God sees, allows, and loves
in ways we do not ripely understand.
Let mankind hobble home now on its knees.
Mr. L'Heureux once said of his writing: “I try to explore the shape of mystery that lies behind the few things I know."
The narrator of his story “Three Short Moments in a Long Life," which The New Yorker published in 2016, is in his 80s and has Parkinson's. Near the end, he speaks to his wife:
“I say, 'I'll miss you when I'm dead.' And in a while there comes the final moment: the earth stops turning and a luminous silence descends. And then, as we draw one last breath together, I snatch your hand. And hold it. Holding it, and holding it, and still holding it, I breathe out."
In his essay “Death and Dignity," Mr. L'Heureux called that story “a kind of love letter" to his wife, Joan. Given what he faced with his illness, he said, “death sooner was better than death delayed."
“In the service for the dead, the Catholic Church asks God to grant us all eternal rest," he wrote, and added that “after all the words squandered on right and wrong, failure and desire, love and the tragic failure to love, I am ready for eternal rest. Eternal rest. Even the sound is soothing."

Texto completo: The 2019 Tony Award nominations might seem to be missing the Pittsburgh factor that is usually a staple of the Broadway season. But pull back the curtain, and you will find six names from the roster of Carnegie Mellon University alumni.
Representing her hometown is one of Broadway's most successful producers, Squirrel Hill native and Carnegie Mellon grad Jamie deRoy. She is a producer on six nominated shows: best play nominees "The Ferryman" and "Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus," play revival "The Waverly Gallery" and musicals "Tootsie," "Ain't Too Proud - The Life and Times of the Temptations" and "Beetlejuice."
"I'm beyond excited. It's a lovely way to wake up," said deRoy by phone on Tuesday, when nominations were announced by Broadway and television actors Brandon Victor Dixon and Bebe Neuwirth.
Other CMU alumni nominated were Peter Hylenski for the sound design of the musicals "King Kong" and "Beetlejuice"; multiple Tony winners Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer for the lighting design of "Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus"; and 87-year-old Oscar and Tony winner Ann Roth, for her costume designs in "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus."
Several of the performers' names called have been on Pittsburgh stages in recent years - Patrick Page ("Hadestown") was Pittsburgh CLO's Scrooge in "A Musical Christmas Carol"; Beth Leavel ("The Prom") did a reading of a new musical at CLO's new music festival; and Eva Noblezada ("Hadestown") and Lilli Cooper ("Tootsie") were here this season for an intimate Trust Cabaret.
"Hadestown" features a book and songs by Anais Mitchell, who played a Pittsburgh Calliope show in November. The show received the most nominations for 2019 with 14, followed by "Ain't Too Proud" with 12 and "The Ferryman" and "To Kill a Mockingbird" with nine each. The reimagined "Oklahoma!" revival, which earned eight nominations, features 2018 Point Park grad Gabrielle Hamilton as its leading dancer in the dream sequence.
In the Tonys' 73 years, CMU alumni have won 47 Tony Awards. Last year, deRoy took home three - as producer of best musical "The Band's Visit" and the revivals of "Once on This Island" and "Angels in America" - bringing her total to six. The other Tonys were for the Tom Stoppard plays "The Norman Conquests" and "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike," and the musical "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."
Of her plays that received nominations, deRoy said she always felt "The Ferryman" was "extremely strong" and acknowledged that anyone who got in on "Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!" was in luck - there were only two revivals of note this season. She also said she had been with "Ain't Too Proud" since its early readings and had enjoyed watching it grow.
On Sunday, it was announced that two-time Tony winner and Carnegie Mellon graduate Judith Light will receive the Isabelle Stevenson Award for her humanitarian efforts and volunteer work fighting HIV/AIDS and support of the LBGTQ+ community.
The 73rd annual Tony Awards will be telecast live June 9 on CBS, with James Corden as host.

Texto completo: The Billboard Music Awards run live on NBC. And Rachel Lears's acclaimed "Knock Down the House" hits Netflix.
What's on TV
2019 BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on NBC. Less than a week after releasing her latest pop anthem, "Me!," Taylor Swift will take the stage as the opener of this year's Billboard Music Awards. Joining her will be the vocalist Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, who is featured on "Me!" Other performers during the broadcast will include Halsey, the Jonas Brothers, Khalid, Madonna, Maluma, Ciara, Dan + Shay, Tori Kelly, the rest of Panic! at the Disco and Mariah Carey, who this year is receiving the Icon Award. That honor has previously been awarded to the likes of Stevie Wonder, Prince and Jennifer Lopez. Kelly Clarkson will return as host.
SING (2016) 8 and 10:30 p.m. on FXX. As the singer Tori Kelly performs live at the Billboard Music Awards on Wednesday night, her voice can also be heard in this animated jukebox musical. Kelly voices Meena, a shy elephant and one of a handful of pumped-up hopefuls who compete in a singing competition put on by Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey), a struggling entrepreneur who is also a koala. (The characters are all animals.) Others represented include a mouse (Seth MacFarlane), pigs (Reese Witherspoon and Nick Kroll) and a gorilla (Taron Egerton). "'Sing' is relentlessly amiable, and has little in the way of vulgar humor," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. "There's just one flatulence joke, which has to be some kind of record for a contemporary non-Pixar kid-friendly animated movie."
What's Streaming
KNOCK DOWN THE HOUSE (2019) Stream on Netflix. This documentary by Rachel Lears picked up an audience award at the Sundance Film Festival in February. It follows four of the women who ran grass-roots campaigns for Congress in 2018, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In an article about the Sundance festival, Manohla Dargis of The Times called the film "fast and efficient," writing that "'Knock Down the House' works because it looks at political action from the ground up."
NEW WORLD SYMPHONY AT CARNEGIE HALL Stream on Medici.tv. The star pianist Yuja Wang will take the stage under the baton of a star conductor, Michael Tilson Thomas, at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night with the New World Symphony. On the program is the New York premiere of a piece by Julia Wolfe, Prokofiev's final piano concerto and Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique," a tone poem that was referred to in a review by Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim in The Times last year as "one of the wildest exhibits in the 19th-century orchestral canon."
CUTTING MY MOTHER Stream on Topic. The director Nathan Silver is known for movies like "Exit Elena," a low-budget 2010 feature about a young live-in nurse who is hired by a suburbanite. Silver's mother, Cindy Silver, played the suburbanite; she's also the subject of this docu-series, which was created by her son.

Every American should read the Mueller report

Texto completo: Robert Mueller’s report landed with an anticlimactic thud. It seems to have changed no one’s mind or made anyone particularly happy.
If you believed that President Donald Trump was guilty of collusion and obstruction before the report came out, you probably still do. And if you didn’t believe it before, you still don’t.
But how many of us have actually read the report? At nearly 450 pages, it’s a bit of a lift. But it’s a fast read. Many pages are heavily redacted; some are completely blacked out. Further, the text on many pages is limited by extensive footnoting.
So here’s a fine civic exercise: All Americans should set aside partisanship, as best they can, and carefully read the report that has been the focus of so much attention. That’s what I did last week. Here’s some of what I found:
If you’ve followed the investigation for the last two years, you will see things in the report that you already know. But Mueller’s cohesive narrative describes, organizes and contextualizes the complicated events surrounding the 2016 election in a helpfully lucid way.
The report doesn’t read like a witch hunt, hack job or hoax cobbled together by partisan Democrats. The prose depends heavily on sworn testimony, corroborating witnesses and supporting documentation – thus, the extensive footnoting.
In fact, Trump-haters may be disappointed in the rigor with which Mueller makes the “no collusion” case. A good example of this is Mueller’s treatment of the infamous June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, which on its face looks like a collusion slam dunk. High-ranking members of the Trump campaign – Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr. – met with well-connected Russians promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.
But beginning on page 180 of Volume I and continuing for about 10 pages, Mueller scrupulously details why the meeting – inadvisable as it might have been, and despite attempts to cover up its true purpose – could probably not be successfully prosecuted as conspiracy.
This may disappoint Trump’s opponents, but it underscores the nonpartisan standing of the report.
But here’s the most important takeaway from the report: The amount of Russian involvement in the 2016 election is staggering, far beyond Jared Kushner’s characterization last week when he called it “a couple of Facebook ads.”
No, Russian meddling in the election was extensive, well-funded and thoroughly connected to the highest levels of the Russian government, as the Mueller report scrupulously documents. And high-level operatives in the Trump campaign, wittingly or unwittingly, had many connections to the Russians. Clearly Russian interference impacted the election, but we’re unlikely to ever know for sure how much it skewed the outcome.
This is important because not much has been done to prevent future meddling. Last week, the New York Times reported that Kirstjen Nielsen, recently fired homeland security secretary, was thwarted in her attempts to raise the issue of Russian meddling in future elections. Trump just doesn’t want to hear about it. Thus, we’re still vulnerable.
Mueller’s portrayal of Russia’s deep involvement in the election helps make sense of other aspects of this episode, including Trump’s desperate attempts to obstruct the investigation, painstakingly described in Volume II.
The report helps us understand other events, as well, for example the infamous press conference at the Helsinki summit in 2018. The two men on the stage, Putin and Trump, shared more or less the same knowledge about Russian interference in the 2016 election and more or less the same goal – to keep it a secret.
Putin, smug and self-satisfied, has no compunction about lying; in fact, he’s probably not particularly worried about being found out.
Trump, on the other hand, is desperate to keep secret the contacts between his campaign officials and high-ranking Russians; he had already tried to fire the special counsel investigating the links.
Trump’s fawning equivocation – “I don’t see why it would be Russia” – serves the same end as Putin’s bald-faced lie. Is this collusion? Coordination? Conspiracy?
It doesn’t matter. Both men clearly knew how to work together to hide the truth. And hiding the truth is the theme that links the Russians and Trump campaign throughout the Mueller report. Give it a read.

Texto completo: An insightful friend of mine remarked recently that before reading the Mueller report, he was sympathetic with Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to pursue impeachment of President Trump, but by the time he finished the report he was convinced Congress has a duty to act.
Our times demand moral clarity. But equally, they require political clarity. When it comes to impeachment, these two imperatives might point Democrats in opposite directions.
The argument that Congress has a duty to act is straightforward: Whether or not Mr. Trump has committed indictable crimes, he has acted in ways that offend the Constitution and degrade his office. Failing to pursue impeachment will make Congress complicit in the normalization of unacceptable behavior.
Here's the counterargument: The president's re-election would be the ultimate normalization of his conduct. In the best scenario for Democrats, even a failed effort to remove the president from office would weaken his electoral prospects. But it's also possible that such an effort would hurt Democrats by making them look aggressive and opportunistic. If the pursuit of impeachment makes Mr. Trump's re-election more likely, it is well-intentioned folly.
No one can know for sure which of these two outcomes is likelier. As Aristotle remarked, we do not deliberate about certainties. Political judgment is an inherently risky and contested business, but we can use evidence to narrow the indeterminacy and estimate probabilities.
Not one major survey has shown a majority or even a plurality of the American people in favor of pursuing impeachment. To be sure, most people have a negative view of Mr. Trump's conduct. In last week's Washington Post/ABC News poll, 53% of respondents said that the Mueller report, which most regard as fair, did not clear the president of all wrongdoing. A plurality, 47%, believe that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice in the course of Mr. Mueller's inquiry. Only 31% think that the president told the truth about the matters under investigation; 58% think he lied. Only 14% say that the Mueller inquiry has made them more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2020, compared with 36% who say less likely.
One might think that these sentiments would lead most Americans to favor impeachment. But the survey finds only 37% favor impeachment while 56% oppose it. Among registered voters, opposition to impeachment is even higher at 60%. Not surprisingly, 62% of Democrats favor it while 87% of Republicans oppose it. But independents, who now constitute a plurality of the electorate, are against impeachment, 59% to 36%.
Almost three quarters of white Americans without college degrees—Mr. Trump's base—oppose impeachment. But anti-impeachment sentiment also runs high among college-educated whites, a group that has moved toward Democrats in recent elections. There is no evidence of a gender gap within this group: 66% of college-educated white men oppose impeachment, as do 65% of college-educated white women. Only nonwhite groups, including 69% of African-Americans, believe that impeachment is the right course.
Though a majority of Democrats say they favor impeachment, reports from the grass roots suggest a lack of intensity on the issue. Congressional Democrats conducting town-hall meetings have found far more interest in health care, climate change and living wages than in removing Mr. Trump from office before the 2020 election. Freshman Rep. Katie Porter of Orange County, Calif., told the New York Times that, as a priority for her constituents, impeaching the president is not in the "top half dozen; it may be down at the No. 12 spot."
Public opinion could shift under the weight of an impeachment inquiry. But it seems more likely that most people have made up their minds about Mr. Trump and are trying to determine whether Democrats and their presidential nominee would be a better alternative. Pursuing impeachment would be unlikely to move undecided voters toward the Democrats.
In his famous essay "Politics as a Vocation," Max Weber distinguishes between the ethic of intention—doing the right thing without regard to consequences—and the ethic of responsibility, in which politicians take account of the probable consequences of their actions. There is no clash between moral clarity and political clarity—as long as Democrats eschew self-defeating high-mindedness and adopt Weber's ethic of responsibility as their pole star. If they are politically serious, they will evaluate every choice—including not only impeachment but also the selection of their presidential nominee—in light of its impact on the 2020 election.

‘Your city is a safe place’

Texto completo: The national media spotlight hasn’t been kind to Topeka the past two weekends, but city officials tried Monday to reassure a grieving community that is still trying to process the loss of 23-year-old Washburn University football player Dwane Simmons.
Simmons’ shooting death and the injury to recent New York Giants draft pick and former WU player Corey Ballentine early Sunday morning in central Topeka came only eight days after a Topeka Zoo worker was attacked and seriously injured by a tiger. The incidents were splashed everywhere — from websites belonging to the Washington Post and New York Times to broadcasts produced by the likes of CNN, CBS and ESPN.
In just over a week, Topeka made plenty of headlines — but for all the wrong reasons. Mayor Michelle De La Isla conceded as much Monday morning during her monthly news briefing at City Hall.
“I regret very much that for the last two weeks the media has been looking at Topeka at the national level with regard to what happened,” she said. “(Those) are two very small incidents compared to all the great things that are happening in our community.”
With the city’s third homicide of 2019 and the zoo attack serving as unflattering backdrops, De La Isla, city manager Brent Trout and Police
Chief Bill Cochran conveyed messages of progress and painted more positive pictures of the capital city.
“To our citizens who are watching us,” De La Isla said, “I’m telling you, your city is a safe place. Your zoo is a well-run zoo and we have amazing staff over there.”
“These incidents, you’re right, they have sound bites they produce, and it’s a small blip on what’s going on around the country,” Trout said. “It’s a very unfortunate thing — obviously, very sad to see it happen. But I think the real message is much more positive for our community, for Washburn and what’s going on in that neighborhood.”
At the outset of the briefing, De La Isla acknowledged that “our community is hurting today” in the wake of the incident involving Simmons and Ballentine, who were shot in the 1400 block of S.W. 13th, about four blocks north of the Washburn campus.
De La Isla commended Topeka police for “working non-stop” in their investigation into the shooting, adding that “our hearts and our prayers” go to Simmons’ family.
Trout said that while the incidents generated national media coverage, they needed to be viewed “in context” of positive trends in the capital city, particularly with regard to improvement in overall crime statistics.
“So for us,” Trout said, “we continue to keep our eye on the ball, which is we are making progress with regard to crime issues within the community and are doing what we can relative to this particular incident.”
Trout added the incident in which zookeeper Kristyn Hayden-Ortega was injured by 7-year-old Sumatran tiger Sanjiv at the zoo is being reviewed to make sure policies and procedures are appropriate and effective.
He said the city and zoo responded to the zoo incident “in a very positive manner,” and both he and De La Isla noted that zoo director Brendan Wiley was commended for providing an abundance of information on the attack after the incident.
Cochran, who was in the audience for the news conference, was called to the front by De La Isla to comment. He said detectives were following good leads in the shooting, which authorities said was witnessed by dozens of people.
Cochran also used his platform to address members of the media.
“Our message is that the media dictates what Topeka looks like,” Cochran said, “and this is an opportunity for our local affiliates to step up and really portray the proper picture of the city of Topeka.”
Asked if there ever is a place for outrage or a time to say “enough is enough” where crime is occurred, Cochran said in part, “I think the citizens of Topeka, the Topeka Police Department, our governing body, the mayor, the city manager, we’re all working together, great things are happening, we’re really making a lot of progress in Topeka and Shawnee County.”
He then cited a vigil scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the bell tower on the Washburn campus as “one of those opportunities where people get to voice an opinion: Hey, enough is enough.”
Moments later, De La Isla ended the news conference by defending the work of Cochran and his department.
“I think the answer to your question is a little bit complicated, and I think it’s a little bit unfair to throw it at the chief to say when is enough enough,” she said. “Enough has been enough for several years, but I think we’re starting to acknowledge it and working through it.”

City's Quaintest Bus Route: Over a Bridge and Back Again

Texto completo: New York City has thousands of buses that trek across the city -- often in slow motion -- on routes that stretch up to nearly 20 miles. Along the way, they make dozens of stops.
Then there is the B39. It goes all of 1.8 miles and makes just three stops.
This little-known bus travels from one side of the Williamsburg Bridge to the other before circling back, like a windup toy stuck on an endless loop between the edges of Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Round and round it goes. It crosses the East River 58 times a day, less often in bad traffic.
Only about 220 people ride the bus on a weekday, the city's lowest daily bus ridership. It is a money loser for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
But for its regular riders the bus is a lifeline. It carries those in wheelchairs, a vital option when the elevator at the closest subway station is not working. It allows the frail, the old and the sick to rest their feet. (Getting a seat is never a problem.) It is an alternative, and an escape, from the crowded subway lines, walkway and bike path that also cross the bridge.
"This bus is very important to a lot of us," said Herbert King, 75, whose walker was parked next to his bus seat. "If it weren't for this bus, we'd all be in trouble because what are we going to depend on?"
Even as cities across the country overhaul outdated bus systems to become more efficient, there are some distinctive bus routes that add a bit of character to the public transit experience.
They may be short -- barely going anywhere. They may draw relatively few riders. They can seem unnecessary especially when there are other, faster transit options. Some are downright quirky.
In Houston, Route 311 runs only on the first Tuesday of every month to take potential bidders about a mile from a transit center to a public auction where county officials sell off real estate properties with unpaid tax bills. There have been four to 113 riders a day, depending on what is for sale.
Denver has a fleet of free electric buses that only run along a single downtown street, making 18 stops in one mile, or on nearly every block, to provide door-to-door service to local businesses. In sprawling Los Angeles, the 601 bus goes a mere 2.7 miles in a loop that connects a transit hub with an office park, a shopping mall and a medical center in the San Fernando Valley.
In Seattle, three buses serving routes 118 and 119 actually roll on to a ferry from downtown to Vashon Island in Puget Sound. "This may be one of the only places in the world where an in-service bus travels on a ferry," said Jeff Switzer, a spokesman for the transit authority.
New York's B39 is all that remains of the trolley car system across the Williamsburg Bridge, which opened in 1903, and carried many immigrants from the tenements of the Lower East Side to Brooklyn and beyond.
There was a "living connection between the two sides" of the East River as families crossed back and forth to work, visited relatives and friends, worshiped at synagogues and even took English lessons, said David Favaloro, the director of curatorial affairs for the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side.
The trolleys were replaced in 1948 by buses. A New York Times article noted that "no ceremony marked the changeover to bus service with the first of 27 new streamlined vehicles."
Today, the B39 fleet has shrunk to just a single bus that runs every half-hour from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is the second shortest of the M.T.A.'s more than 300 bus routes. The shortest is the 1.3-mile B42 route that connects Canarsie, Brooklyn, to a subway station and bus transfer hub. The longest is the S78's 19.5-mile trip across Staten Island with 117 stops. The average route is six miles.
The transportation authority spends $ 565,000 annually to operate the B39. With a total of 74,000 passengers in all of 2018 -- down from 104,000 in 2014 -- it would have collected only $ 203,500 if everyone paid the full fare of $ 2.75. (Of course, the authority loses money on many bus routes).
The B39 was supposed to be suspended as part of the shutdown of the L line, which links Brooklyn and Manhattan. The plan was to replace it temporarily with expanded bus service to carry displaced L train riders. But like many commuters, the B39 received a reprieve when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo intervened at the last minute to avert a full shutdown.
It was the second close call for the B39. In 2010, the bus route was eliminated in sweeping budget cuts. But riders rose up in protest, the authority relented and the bus was restored in 2013.
Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University in Chicago who has studied urban bus systems, said that such little-used routes can be "alarmingly expensive." Cities often hang on to them even when they no longer make economic sense to avoid backlash from a small number of loyal riders, he said.
"In a city like New York, in which congestion is acute and transportation needs are enormous, there is generally little justification for maintaining bus lines that move only a handful of people per trip," he said.
The B39 starts in Brooklyn at the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza, at the foot of the bridge, and then crosses the river and makes two stops on the Lower East Side. Then it swings around and stops twice to pick up passengers as it heads back to the bridge plaza.
"The B39 provides a critical connection between Brooklyn and Manhattan for customers who need additional accessibility options," said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the transportation authority, pointing out that the bus also allows riders to make Manhattan connections to the Financial District or to the Upper East Side.
Pete Lopez, 63, a retired teacher in Williamsburg who has been riding the B39 for decades, said he has come to rely on it because he has trouble walking -- "my feet gave up on me" -- and does not want to attempt the stairs at subway stations. "It's my buddy," he said. "I need this bus, and as I get older, I need it more."
Other regulars said that hopping onto the B39 is far more pleasant than squeezing onto the subway. "You don't have to wait with a lot of people," said Anna Marte, 62, a Lower East Side resident who takes the bus at least once a week. "Nobody pushes you."
But Ms. Marte does have to wait. With only one bus running, there can be long delays if it gets trapped in traffic on the bridge. After waiting 40 minutes the other day, Ms. Marte finally gave up and headed to the subway. It would be another 10 minutes before the B39 turned up. By then, no one was at the stop.
Angel Arroyo, who was behind the wheel of the B39, recalled that a cement truck broke down on the bridge a few months ago and had to be towed. He was delayed by nearly an hour. "No one else was on the bus -- that was a good thing, otherwise, it would have been, 'Let me off, I'll swim,"' he said. "You can't do anything about it. You just have to sit there and wait it out."
Mr. Arroyo, 52, said he does not mind driving in circles. Where else, he said, would he have panoramic river views at his feet? "Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle," he said. "For me, this is peace of mind."
The bus ride is comforting, as well, for many of Mr. Arroyo's regulars. Most are over 50, including a 94-year-old man who takes the bus to church every Sunday. Some stand up in front with him after swiping their fare cards to talk.
"We're like a family on the bus -- everybody knows everybody," said Jeffrey Brown, 61, as he rolled onto the bus in a wheelchair.

Texto completo: Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein - whose tumultuous two years as the No. 2 Justice Department official were marked by battles over the special-counsel probe of President Trump - submitted a resignation letter Monday indicating he will leave the job in two weeks.
Rosenstein's departure had been expected since the beginning of the year, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III wound down his investigation and compiled a report detailing his findings.
Since his first days on the job, Rosenstein's role in the Trump administration was controversial, from the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017 to the conclusion by Rosenstein and Attorney General William P. Barr that there was not sufficient evidence for an obstruction-of-justice case against the president.
In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein praised the president for his personal charm and policy goals. "As I submit my resignation effective on May 11, I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because 'a nation exists to serve its citizens,' " Rosenstein wrote.
He ended his letter with a sentence that asserted the Justice Department's independence, before closing with a phrase from Trump's campaign: "We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first."
The resignation letter was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The new attorney general praised Rosenstein's long career in federal law enforcement.
"Over the course of his distinguished government career, he has navigated many challenging situations with strength, grace, and good humor," Barr said in a statement. "Rod has been an invaluable partner to me during my return to the Department, and I have relied heavily on his leadership and judgment over the past several months."
Earlier this year, Trump nominated Rosenstein's replacement, Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen, who still must be confirmed by the Senate. The Judiciary Committee said Monday it will consider Rosen's nomination on Thursday, which means he could be confirmed by early May.
Rosenstein's resignation letter comes days after The Washington Post reported that he had assured Trump in a call last year that he was on his team and that the special counsel's investigation would treat the president fairly.
The September conversation, according to people familiar with it, followed an explosive New York Times report that Rosenstein had suggested wearing a wire to surreptitiously monitor the president, or using the 25th Amendment to oust him from office - reporting that Rosenstein disputes.
"I give the investigation credibility," Rosenstein told Trump, according to an administration official with knowledge of what was said during the call. "I can land the plane."
In his resignation letter, Rosenstein extolled the Justice Department's accomplishments during the Trump administration.
"We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls," Rosenstein wrote. "We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle."
He also defended the department's handling of the Russia probe, writing that the country "is safer, our elections are more secure, and our citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence efforts." Rosenstein went on to cite the kinds of cases in which the president has expressed a personal interest. "We also pursued illegal leaks, investigated credible allegations of employee misconduct, and accommodated congressional oversight without compromising law enforcement interests," he wrote.
Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration, said he found particularly odd the "over-the-top praise for the president who has spent his entire tenure attacking the Department of Justice. . . . When one of the most consistent themes of the president's tenure has been attacking the career men and women at the Department of Justice, it's just inappropriate for a deputy attorney general to heap all of this unalloyed praise on him."
On Thursday, in one of his last public speeches as the deputy attorney general, Rosenstein lashed out at politicians and the media, denouncing what he called "mercenary critics who get paid to express passionate opinions about any topic, often with little or no information. . . . They make threats, spread fake stories and even attack your relatives."
In recent weeks, Rosenstein has faced criticism for how the Justice Department released the findings of Mueller's investigation. Rosenstein signed on to Barr's conclusion - which went further than Mueller had been willing to go - that there was insufficient evidence to accuse Trump of obstructing justice, and he stood behind Barr when the attorney general repeatedly declared at a news conference that Mueller had concluded there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Democrats and legal analysts have asserted that Barr was casting Mueller's report in a way that was overly favorable to Trump, with public support from Rosenstein.
Rosenstein was long viewed as one of the last bastions insulating the Mueller probe from political interference. But Rosenstein's role was always deeply controversial, since it was a memo he wrote criticizing Comey that formed the public justification for firing him as FBI director - a move that led Rosenstein, days later, to appoint Mueller as special counsel to carry on the Russia investigation.

Texto completo: During his time as defense secretary, Jim Mattis sought to deflect President Trump from what he thought were ill-advised decisions in North Korea or Afghanistan by limiting his options, according to the New Yorker.

On one occasion in 2017, he failed to send officers and planners to take part in a war game in front of Trump at the presidential retreat of Camp David.

“He prevented the thing from happening,” a former senior administration official told the magazine, amid suggestions that the exercise may have increased the likelihood of a strike on the hermit kingdom.

On another occasion, he prevented Gen. John Nicholson, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, from meeting the president.

At times, Mattis' maneuvering caused tension between Trump and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, whom Trump blamed for blocking him from doing what he wanted, even though the culprit may have been Mattis.

Mattis served as defense secretary until December, when he resigned over policy differences with Trump.

He had previously won praise among independent commentators for a balancing act that saw him keep NATO allies on side without alienating the president, who has been confrontational with the Europeans.

However, he resigned when Trump announced he was going to withdraw all American troops from Syria, alarming other members of the coalition fighting the Islamic State.

The New Yorker piece, a profile of John Bolton, the current national security adviser, showed just how Mattis managed to navigate the demands of the role.

A former national security official told the magazine a strategy evolved to quietly ignore presidential requests.

“The president thinks out loud,” he said. “Do you treat it like an order? Or do you treat it as part of a longer conversation? We treated it as part of a longer conversation.”

The account is the latest example of an internal “resistance” designed to thwart Trump’s ambitions.

An anonymous official wrote in the New York Times last year that a number of appointees believed the president was acting in ways detrimental to “the health of our republic.”

“That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office,” he or she wrote.

AOC seizes on California synagogue shooting to promote gun control legislation

Texto completo: The Donald Trump of the Left is angry-tweeting again.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., exploited a deadly synagogue shooting this weekend to promote a House bill, H.R. 8, mandating stricter requirements for firearm transfers between unlicensed individuals.

“Heartbroken to hear of the San Diego synagogue shooting, particularly so on this final day of Passover. We have a responsibility to love + protect our neighbors,” she said in a tweet. “The longer the Senate delays holding a vote on #HR8, the more we put Americans at risk.”

One woman was killed after a 19-year-old gunman opened fire at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California. At least three others were injured. The suspect was arrested shortly after the shooting and taken into custody by local law enforcement officials. The suspect's motives were not made public at the time of his arrest.
The congresswoman's tweet is a lousy, self-promoting response for a couple of reasons.

First, her response was quick enough that she had to have known very little about the attacker or the attack itself when she sent it. She most certainly knew nothing of the motivations of the gunman. The congresswoman blindly spouted off, most likely because she saw an opportunity to promote the House’s pro-gun control legislation. How noble of her.

Second, it is probably worth mentioning that Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet calling for stricter gun control laws came almost immediately after a shooting event in California, which has some the strictest (if not the strictest) firearm laws in the nation. Of the top 10 most-restrictive states, California scores first place, according to the Brady Campaign. California gets an “A” rating from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The state’s gun control laws are “among the toughest in the nation,” according to the New York Times. And so on.

There is a larger conversation to be had about the effect that states with laxer gun control laws have on the states that strive for strict enforcement. There is also a conversation to be had about Eugene Volokh’s finding that there is “zero correlation between state homicide rate and state gun laws.” But let’s maybe wait until the victims have at least buried their dead before spouting off half-cocked on Twitter.

Finally, Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks grieving over a synagogue shooting would probably hold more weight had she not famously circled the wagons for her colleague, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., an actual anti-Semite. Considering the lengths to which Ocasio-Cortez went to protect her friend from congressional censure for claiming, among other things, that wealthy Jews own the congressional GOP and that Jewish Americans have divided loyalties if they support Israel's right to exist, a cynical person would suspect that the New York congresswoman's remarks this weekend are animated more by self-promotion and ideology than by genuine grief for the Poway victims.

But I am not that cynical.

New York Times published anti-Netanyahu cartoon after apologizing for 'anti-Semitic tropes' by same cartoonist

Texto completo: After publishing an anti-Semitic cartoon for which it later apologized, the New York Times published another cartoon from the same cartoonist this weekend.

The second cartoon by António Moreira Antunes, who is Portuguese and works under the mononym António for the Lisbon weekly Expresso, is a caricature of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Moses, holding a selfie stick in one hand and a stone tablet with the Star of David in the other hand, descending from Mount Sinai. It was printed on Saturday beside an unrelated David Brooks column.

The first António cartoon was published in the International New York Times on Thursday, with a drawing depicting President Trump as blind, wearing a yarmulke, and being led by Netanyahu, who is portrayed as a service dog with a Star of David dangling from its collar. The cartoon had earlier been published by Expresso.

The New York Times said Saturday it had made an “error of judgment” in publishing a cartoon containing "anti-Semitic tropes." It then apologized on Sunday saying they were “deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon.”

António, who has been publishing editorial cartoons since 1974, has a history of controversial cartoons, including one from 1983 that compared Israeli treatment of Palestinians to the Nazi slaughter in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust.

In 1993, he was excoriated for an Expresso cartoon depicting Pope John Paul II with a condom on the end of his nose. More than 15,000 people signed a petition calling on the Portuguese parliament to repudiate it.

A 2006 António cartoon unearthed this weekend was described as anti-Semitic by many social media users. Published during the Second Lebanon War, it showed one leg tied up with explosives and attached to an Islamic crescent moon, and another leg — adorned with the American flag — attached to a bloody Star of David.

In a 2015 interview with the Portuguese Observador after the mass shooting at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, António defended artistic freedom

“The profession of cartoonist is a profession of risk, we make risks and take risks,” he said in the interview. “There is always fear there, but there is no other option but to defend freedom of expression."

ET TU, KATE? FLYERS, YANKEES BOW TO BLIND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS

Texto completo: America's heroes, from George Washington on down, have reflected the greatness and flaws of their times.
This is true also of Kate Smith, who gave voice to America's World War II efforts and buoyed the nation's spirit during uncertain days. She should be honored for who she was and what she gave the nation despite her flaws.
When she died at 79 in 1986, Smith was one of the nation's best-known singers. According to a story recounted in the singer's New York Times obituary, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced her to England's King George VI by saying, "This is Kate Smith. Miss Smith is America."
Smith cemented her place in history during WWII, when her performances of Irving Berlin's "God Bless America" helped to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in war bonds. Much later, she sang the song at a handful of Philadelphia Flyers' games, causing a sensation. The team seemed to play up a notch when she performed or when her recording of "God Bless America" was played before the puck dropped. The Flyers and New York Yankees, continued to play her recordings for decades after her death.
Until now. The Flyers and Yankees have silenced her contralto, and the Flyers first covered up Smith's statue outside their stadium then removed it. Why? Because a fan alerted the Yankees to racist titles and lyrics in a couple of Smith's most ancient songs.
Never mind that there's some question as to whether one of the songs was intended as satire or that her statue was, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, one of the few in that city honoring women.
Never mind, as the Inquirer also reported, that Smith called for racial tolerance on a 1945 radio show. Smith appeared on radio shows thousands of times and was known as the "first lady of radio." What she said mattered.
It evidently did not occur to the Flyers or Yankees that Smith was a product of her times or that history is best remembered, confronted and addressed, not obliterated when its subjects are out of favor, Soviet Union-style. The teams' mindless overreaction is the same as that which led to the removal of the Stephen Foster statue in Oakland last year.
Ernie Troiano Jr., the mayor of Wildwood, N.J. has offered to take Smith's statue and pledged to continue playing her recording of "God Bless America" on the city's boardwalk every day. Is he condoning racism? No, just giving Smith and her place in history the thoughtful treatment they deserve. Good for him.

Texto completo: Warren Adler, best-selling author of ‘The War of the Roses,’ dies at 91

Warren Adler, a best-selling author who chronicled dysfunction and duplicity, most notably in his divorce novel “The War of the Roses,” a dark comedy that served as the basis of a hit film, died April 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was liver cancer, said his son Michael Adler.
A mid-century fixture of the Washington social scene, Adler lived in the District of Columbia until the mid-1980s, owned four television and radio stations, and founded the now-defunct society magazine Washington Dossier with his wife and one of his sons.
He also presided over an advertising agency that represented political candidates such as Richard M. Nixon and real estate developments including the Watergate complex, whose name he said he created, inspired by the nearby Water Gate Inn restaurant.
Although he started late, publishing his first book at 46, Adler wrote more than 50 novels, plays and works of poetry or short fiction, sometimes churning out two volumes a year. His work spanned decades and continents, from the Catskills of the 1930s to the Trans-Siberian Express of the Soviet Union. His characters were often plotting their escape from unhappy marriages, concealing affairs or scanning the obituary pages in search of wealthy widowers.
“I’ve become a specialist in wrecked relations,” he told the New York Times in 1991. “My turf is the never-ending battle of the sexes that goes on to the grave.”
Shortly before his death, he told his family he was writing a book in his head - a period piece set after World War I - although he knew he would never be able to put it to paper. “He said, ‘That’s what I do, and I can’t stop myself,’ ” Michael Adler said by phone.
Influenced by authors including W. Somerset Maugham and Georges Simenon, he said he had dreamed of becoming a novelist since 15 and for many years wrote “from 5 to 10 in the morning every day before going to my office.” His evenings were spent at the Jockey Club or parties on Embassy Row, picking up snippets of conversation he might use in his books.
He faced a quarter-century’s worth of rejections before publishing his first novel, “Options” (later reprinted as “Undertow”), in 1974. Quitting the ad industry to write full time, he found his greatest success with “The War of the Roses” (1981), which tracked the implosion of Jonathan and Barbara Rose’s once-perfect marriage.
It was inspired by a conversation Adler once had at a dinner party in the District. “A guy told me that he had to go home to his wife,” Adler told in 1989. “But he was dating my friend. He said, ‘I’m having a divorce, but we’re living in a house together. We share the refrigerator and we have separate times to use the washing machine.’ That triggered in me the ultimate married man’s fantasy.”
Macabre, humorous and occasionally harrowing - in one scene, Barbara turns her husband’s beloved dog into pâté - the novel was adapted into a 1989 film starring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, who also directed. With few exceptions, the movie remained loyal to the novel. (The dog survives).
The film grossed $160 million worldwide and led studio executives to rush to buy Adler’s books and manuscripts. Several were optioned, including his unpublished novel “Private Lies,” which was sold to TriStar Pictures for $1.2 million in 1990 - then a record-setting price for a manuscript - although few made it to the screen.
His short story collection “The Sunset Gang” (1977), about a group of elderly Jews in Florida, was adapted for the public television series “American Playhouse” in 1991 and later produced as an off-Broadway musical. And in 1999, Adler’s novel “Random Hearts” (1984), about a man and woman whose spouses die in a plane crash, was turned into a film featuring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas.
The novel had lingered in development limbo for years. By his account, Adler was sidelined from production, once told that his presence at a filmmakers’ meeting would offend everyone involved - assuming he decided to defend his book against proposed changes.
“Defend the book?” Adler wrote in a 1999 piece for the Times. “I imagined I could hear its pleading voice from the constipated bowels of the studio: ‘Dummy. What did you get me into?’ For that, I had no defense.”
The adaptation failed to approach the success or acclaim of “War of the Roses,” which Adler turned into a play in 2013. (A separate adaptation of the novel is slated to run on Broadway.) But he said that seven-figure profits from his work in Hollywood enabled him to fund his writing, broaden his audience and, hopefully, secure his legacy.
“The money is great but more important than the money is people taking my books seriously,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1990. “I’m shooting for my books to last. Otherwise I couldn’t spend all those days alone in a room doing this. But it’s what I love. I love novels. It’s a one-on-one communication system. The novel is still to me the greatest art form in the world.”
Warren Adler was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 16, 1927. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was a clerk who was “always unemployed,” Michael Adler said. The family lived with various relatives in the home of Warren’s grandparents, where 11 people shared a bathroom.
Adler studied English at New York University, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1947, and during the Korean War he served as Washington correspondent for the Armed Forces Press Service.
He remained in the District to found his advertising and public relations agency Warren Adler Ltd. in 1957, and in 1975 established Washington Dossier. The magazine was edited by his wife, the former Sonia Kline, and published by his son David Adler, before the family sold it in 1986 to businessman Ron Haan.
In 1978, Adler wrote an Esquire magazine feature about “rescuing” and “deprogramming” David from a cultlike commune run by the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. The incident drew national news coverage, with Adler saying he threatened to commit suicide as part of an effort to lure his son away from the church.
In addition to his wife of 67 years, survivors include his three sons, Michael Adler of Calabasas, California, Jonathan Adler of Bethesda, Maryland, and David Adler of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren. Adler had spent much of the past several years caring for his wife, who has dementia and lives in an assisted-living facility in Glen Cove, New York.
“I do not believe she suffers emotional distress, but I do,” he wrote in one of his last published articles, a February essay for AARP. “Now I live alone in the home we shared, and I am trying to cope with the bruising experience of loneliness. I am told it is a curable malady, and I am following the advice of others. I made my living as an author and playwright, and I continue to write, exercise daily and force myself to socialize. I am told it will take time. I am 91. How much time?”

Texto completo: Two southwest Wisconsin lawmakers hope to revitalize the state's dairy industry by spurring collegiate innovation.
State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, and state Rep. Travis Tranel, R-Cuba City, authored a bill that would provide nearly $8 million to the University of Wisconsin System for dairy programs.
A little more than $1.8 million would go to University of Wisconsin-Platteville, according to a press release. That would support four Dairy Science faculty positions, provide research opportunities and help the school acquire equipment to aid student education.
"One of the things we're trying to do is re-energize, revitalize the dairy industry in Wisconsin," Marklein said. "Trying to invest more money into research and to look at some of the nontraditional concerns about the industry."
The bill "isn't about producing more milk," he said.
"It's about looking at consumer preferences and maybe coming up with new market (interest) for our milk, looking at sustainability issues in how we farm," Marklein said.
Dropping milk prices and uncertainty about exports have had substantial negative impacts on one of Wisconsin's chief economic drivers.
According to the state's Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, there are 7,898 milk cow herds in the state, down from 8,649 one year ago this month. Back in 2003, there were more than 16,000 milk cow herds in the state.
"Our dairy farms are so integral to our rural communities," said Marklein. "These are the farms (from which) kids go to our local schools and shop at our Main Streets in rural Wisconsin."
In a press release, Tera Montgomery, a UW-P associate professor and Dairy Science program coordinator, said the added funding would "help in the classroom and all the hands-on experiences (the school) is already known for."
"This program is not only going to bring in human capital, but also enhance our research out at Pioneer Farm, as well as help with the lab space we have," she said in the release.
For the funding to come to fruition, the bill must be approved by state lawmakers as part of Wisconsin's biannual budget process. The budget usually is finalized in late spring or early summer.
MCKEAN MAKEs WAVES with GOP defection
The defection of Iowa's longest-serving Republican state lawmaker to the minority party didn't just make waves in Des Moines and eastern Iowa. Rep. Andy McKean's ideological evolution made headlines far beyond the retired attorney's home in Anamosa.
McKean, who cruised to victory in Iowa House of Representatives District 58 in 2016 and 2018, on Tuesday announced the rift with his party. He cited several concerns, including an increasingly "regimented" Republican leadership and disagreements on several key issues.
But what really made McKean's announcement notable to the national media - including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, ABC Politics and many more outlets - was his belief that the party's "standard-bearer," President Donald Trump, was not someone he could continue to support.
"(The president) sets, in my opinion, a poor example for the nation and particularly for our children by personally insulting, often in a crude and juvenile fashion, those who disagree with him, being a bully at a time when we're attempting to discourage bullying, his frequent disregard for the truth and his willingness to ridicule or marginalize people for their appearance, ethnicity or disability," McKean said during a press conference Tuesday.
National media outlets have focused on the Trump comments. The headline of the Boston Globe's account of McKean's announcement asked, "Is Trump driving politicians out of the Republican Party?"
FEDERAL LAWMAKERS SUPPORT MEDICAID probe
Iowa's three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed a letter supporting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' decision to investigate whether Medicaid managed-care organizations have complied with federal requirements when denying patients access to certain services and medications.
Iowa leaders in 2016 privatized the Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for 600,000 needy and disabled Iowans.
"Iowa families have paid a devastating price from day one of privatized Medicaid in our state," said U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer in a statement. "I will personally never forget the stories from my own constituents who had been denied lifesaving tube feedings or the countless heartbreaking stories from across our state from individuals, families and our dedicated and caring providers."
ERNST TALKS MUELLER REPORT
During a town hall meeting last week in Dubuque, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, fielded questions from the audience about the report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller. The 400-page document details an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice.
"The report is over 400 pages," Ernst said, in response to an audience question. "I have not had time to read the full report. My staff has been driving into that and provided the overview. ... I would guess not every senator has read the full report. Many are out doing things like I'm doing today."
Ernst also acknowledged, after the audience urged her to respond to a follow-up question, that she is "sure" she will "come across many instances that would seem shocking, maybe."

Guantanamo Bay prison commander fired

Texto completo: The commander of the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba has been fired.

Rear Adm. John Ring, commander of Joint Task Force-Guantánamo, was relieved of duty Saturday following an investigation, according to the New York Times. Adm. Craig Faller made the call due to a “loss of confidence in his ability” to continue running the prison, which houses some of the most infamous terrorists in the world.

It is not immediately known what prompted the investigation or what it uncovered. Col. Amanda Azubuike, a spokeswoman for the Southern Command, said the decision was unrelated to a recent visit by members of the news media. She also said the change would not impact operations at the prison.

“This change in leadership will not interrupt the safe, humane, legal care and custody provided to the detainee population at GTMO,” military officials said in a statement.

Ring, who has led the facility since April of last year, will be replaced in an acting capacity by Brig. Gen. John F. Hussey, his deputy.

Guantánamo Bay prison currently holds 40 detainees, down from a high of more than 600, and has had 18 commanders since it was formed in 2002. Some of those detained are alleged to have been involved with the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. In addition to the prison, Guantánamo Bay has a Navy base with about 1,700 troops stationed there.

Despite efforts by former President Barack Obama to close the facility, President Trump has insisted it will remain open. Last year officials were told to draw up plans to keep the center going for another 25 years, through 2043.

Stagecoach 2019: Sam Hunt closes out the second night with a big ‘ol dance party

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

N.R.A. President to Step Down, As a Leadership Crisis Deepens

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS -- Oliver L. North announced on Saturday that he would not serve a second term as the National Rifle Association's president, deciding to step down as the organization grappled with a bitter dispute over its future and its worst leadership crisis in decades.
He made the announcement as the N.R.A. faced a challenge from the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who had opened an investigation into the gun group's tax-exempt status.
On Friday, Ms. James's office sent letters instructing the N.R.A. and affiliated entities, including its charitable foundation, to preserve relevant financial records. Some of the N.R.A.'s related businesses also received subpoenas, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry. Both the attorney general's office and a lawyer for the N.R.A. confirmed the investigation.

The move by Ms. James came amid a stunning internal power struggle that took a major turn on Saturday when Mr. North, in a letter that was read on his behalf at the N.R.A.'s convention, said he would not be renominated. He and insurgents in the N.R.A. this past week had been trying to oust Wayne LaPierre, the group's longtime chief executive.
"It was a great privilege to serve as your president this past year," Mr. North said in the letter. He added that the N.R.A. had "a clear crisis" that it needed to deal with "immediately and responsibly," and that he had recently created a committee to investigate financial improprieties.
His move appeared to end the struggle against Mr. LaPierre, though there will likely be more clarity after the N.R.A.'s board meets on Monday. Supporters of Mr. North spoke up during a contentious gathering after his statement, but Mr. LaPierre appeared to hold substantial support in the room.
Their standoff began on Wednesday, when Mr. North urged Mr. LaPierre to resign. On Thursday, Mr. LaPierre sent a letter to the board in which he accused Mr. North of threatening to release damaging information about him and other executives if he refused to step down.
The shadow cast by Ms. James's looming action had in some ways spurred the confrontation unfolding at the N.R.A.'s annual convention.
Even before her election last year, Ms. James had promised to investigate the organization's tax status, and had told Ebony magazine that the N.R.A. held itself "out as a charitable organization" but was actually "a terrorist organization."
She has special jurisdiction over the group because it was chartered in New York. Her office has broad authority to investigate nonprofits and can seek a number of potential remedies against them in court; a previous inquiry by Ms. James's predecessors led to the shuttering of President Trump's charitable foundation, a far smaller enterprise.
"The N.R.A. will fully cooperate with any inquiry into its finances," William A. Brewer III, the N.R.A.'s outside counsel, said in a statement on Saturday. "The N.R.A. is prepared for this, and has full confidence in its accounting practices and commitment to good governance."
In a statement Saturday evening, Ms. James's office said it had "launched an investigation related to the National Rifle Association" and "has issued subpoenas. We will not have further comment at this time."
Mr. Brewer has assailed Ms. James in the past for threatening to investigate the N.R.A. before she was elected, saying she was embarking on "a taxpayer-funded fishing expedition."
But such warnings were taken seriously, and last August the N.R.A. embarked on a review of its relationships with all of its contractors.
N.R.A. officials, including Mr. LaPierre, have said that its most prominent contractor, the Oklahoma-based ad firm Ackerman McQueen, did not comply with its requests to turn over financial records, a contention that Ackerman has contested.
The dispute led the N.R.A. to sue Ackerman earlier this month, and the lawsuit is at the heart of the infighting. Mr. North is an employee of Ackerman and is paid "millions of dollars annually" by the company, Mr. LaPierre told the board on Thursday. Mr. North had sided with Ackerman in the legal battle, alarming some board members.
The legal fight has crippled a longstanding relationship between the N.R.A. and Ackerman, two organizations that are tightly intertwined. Ackerman came up with memorable lines such as Charlton Heston's proclamation that his gun would have to be pried "from my cold, dead hands." Ackerman also developed NRATV, a controversial online streaming network that had aroused concerns among some board members for straying too far from gun rights. The network's personalities warned of race wars and portrayed the talking trains in the children's show "Thomas & Friends" in Ku Klux Klan hoods.
There are a number of potential issues that could arise in Ms. James's inquiry. Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that the N.R.A.'s affiliated charity, the N.R.A. Foundation, had transferred more than $ 100 million since 2012 to the N.R.A., and that it also lent the N.R.A. $ 5 million in 2017. Donations to the N.R.A. Foundation are tax-deductible, while those to the N.R.A. are not, and the transfers concerned some tax experts.
The Times also reported that the N.R.A. had paid $ 18 million since 2010 to a company that produces "Under Wild Skies," a hunting show on NRATV. Tyler Schropp, the N.R.A.'s advancement director, had a stake in the production company until at least 2017; nonprofit rules require a cautious approach for transactions that benefit key executives.
The Wall Street Journal has reported on multiple transactions benefiting firms with ties to N.R.A. officials, while The New Yorker further scrutinized internal conflicts within the organization.
Mr. North cited reporting by all three organizations as the impetus for actions he had recently taken, saying "these allegations of financial improprieties could threaten our nonprofit status."
The latest developments come amid a variety of challenges for the N.R.A., including lagging contributions and an increasingly well-financed gun control movement, motivated by a string of mass shootings.
And the attorney general's inquiry is not the only threat the gun group faces in New York. The N.R.A. is already in a legal battle with the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over insurance it offers to gun owners.
Speaking at the convention on Saturday, Mr. LaPierre lashed out at Mr. Cuomo, saying he "hates the N.R.A. and he hates our freedom." He also asked how Ms. James's description of the N.R.A. as a "terrorist organization" made its members feel. The crowd answered with a cascade of boos.
Going back to the late 1970s, the N.R.A. has had upheavals every couple of decades that have altered the organization's trajectory. Board members see their meeting on Monday as the latest such defining battle.
Mr. North, who was recently installed as president, was the central figure in the Reagan-era Iran-contra affair and remains a hero to many on the right.
His announcement caught high-ranking members of the organization off guard. One member approached a reporter on Saturday outside a ballroom where the group was meeting, and asked, "Can you tell me what's going on?"

Texto completo: The news media stokes stock-watching mania as if we were a nation of day traders. The phenomenon appears in its most extreme forms on the financial TV channels, but it's everywhere: Ticktock changes in market indexes are plastered into a corner of cable news screens or scroll by in nonstop chyrons. Even nonfinancial outlets - broadcast, cable, radio and digital - diligently include a stock-market roundup in their reports.
But barely half of Americans own stock, and those who do are typically investing for retirement, in which case it makes no sense to follow the daily gyrations of the market. The herd mentality tugs at us to buy when we hear stocks are rising and to sell when stocks are falling. Yet studies show that when amateurs - and most pros, too - try to "time" the market, they do worse than if they'd simply added to an index fund at regular intervals. (The lack of context makes the updates even worse. "Dow down 150 points" splashed in large type on a TV screen certainly sets off our fear receptors, but many news outlets omit, or play down, the percentage drop - which is often far less alarming.)
And if you're going to insist on reporting what "the market" is doing this very minute, at least pick an index that actually represents the market as a whole. The Dow Jones industrial average comprises just 30 stocks - which, by the way, are added and deleted at the whims of the Dow gods, who don't follow transparent rules for inclusion and exclusion.
TV producers aren't going to dispense with this style of financial "coverage" entirely, although they should. You want the best shot at reaching your retirement goals? Stick to your long-term strategy, and don't give those daily market updates a moment's thought.

FIRE VIDEO PROJECT WINS NATIONAL AWARD FOR BAY AREA NEWS GROUP

Texto completo: The Bay Area News Group publisher of the Mercury News and East Bay Times received national honors Thursday from the Society of Professional Journalists for its exclusive look last year at police body-camera video from the deadly Wine Country fires.
"You just gotta get out of here" was awarded a 2018 Sigma Delta Chi Award for Online Non-Deadline Reporting the second national award for the immersive multimedia project, which also received a 2018 EPPY.
The recognition comes a week-and-a-half after the Bay Area News Group and the staff of its partner newspaper the Chico Enterprise-Record were named finalists for a Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for their collaborative coverage of last year's devastating Camp Fire.
Reporters Julia Prodis Sulek and Matthias Gafni, video producer Randy Vasquez and web designer Pai teamed up to produce "You just gotta get out of here," bringing to light heroic rescuers and harrowing escapes and helping explain why people in danger sometimes don't flee. Through vivid multimedia, the project illuminated the life-and-death choices Californians may soon face before and after the next big wildfire.
"We're humbled by this recognition from SPJ," said Frank Pine, executive editor of the Bay Area News Group and Southern California News Group. "We hope our reporting in the wake of this tragic firestorm will help ensure our readers are better prepared should they ever face such an incredible disaster."
The award was the second in two years from the Society of Professional Journalists for Prodis Sulek, who took home a Sigma Delta Chi last year for her six-part narrative series and podcast "Hanging: The mysterious case of the boy in the barn."
The Sigma Delta Chi Awards recognized the best journalism in 2018 from newspapers, online news sites, television and radio broadcasts, and magazines. Other winners included work from the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Reveal from the Emeryville-based Center for Investigative Reporting. Winners will be honored in June at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

The history-cleansing brigade

Texto completo: Margaret Sanger is an American heroine. She opened our country's first birth-control clinic and helped found Planned Parenthood, which brought reproductive services to millions of women. But Sanger also endorsed the racist pseudo-science of eugenics, promoting contraception and sterilization to limit population growth among immigrants and African-Americans.
So should we take down statues and other memorials to her? That's what 25 House Republicans said in 2015, petitioning the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery to remove a bust of Sanger.
But in a country marked by four centuries of bigotry and discrimination, many notable figures engaged in some form of it. Removing those people from our view actually lets us whitewash racism, all in the guise of fighting it.
And that brings us to Kate Smith, the latest target of the history-cleansing brigade. After newspapers reported that Smith had performed several racist songs, the New York Yankees said they would suspend for now playing her iconic version of "God Bless America" at their games. So did my hometown Philadelphia Flyers, who also took down a statue of Smith erected outside of their arena.
Smith had performed "God Bless America" live on the night the Flyers won the 1974 Stanley Cup, which triggered a virtual Cult of Kate in the City of Brotherly Love. As Philly die-hards will remind you, the Flyers won three games and lost one when Smith sang live; in games where her recorded version was played, the team has won 100, lost 31 and tied five.
But now her good luck has run out. Noting that Kate Smith performed songs that "evoke painful and unacceptable themes," the Flyers declared that they would stop playing Smith's "God Bless America" - and would take down her statue - "to ensure the sentiments stirred this week are no longer echoed."
Good luck with that. Racism echoes through the entire history of American entertainment, as Smith's career shows. It isn't just that Smith performed "That's Why Darkies Were Born" and "Pickaninny Heaven," the two songs that most news reports have flagged. Like so many other white singers, from Al Jolson to Elvis Presley, she founded her art on racial imitation and parody.
In 1926, the first New York Times review of Smith's performance described her with a term that referred to white performers who sang and danced in styles associated with African-Americans.
The following year, Smith wore blackface to play the role of a "mammy" in a New York musical. She soon became a sensation on the radio, where her mimicry of black dialect made some listeners wonder about her racial background. As late as 1941, an African-American in Arkansas wrote to The Chicago Defender weekly newspaper to ask whether Kate Smith was "white or colored."
Eliminating her song or statue won't make this history go away; it will only make it harder to remember. The better solution is always to add knowledge, not subtract it, so all of us learn how race has impacted our past.
So baseball games might couple Smith's version of "God Bless America" with "Lift Every Voice and Sing," which some have called the "Negro national anthem," composed by James Weldon Johnson. And Smith's statue could include a plaque describing her career, including its blackface roots.
Here we could take a page from the National Portrait Gallery, where the label next to Margaret Sanger's statue notes her association with the eugenics movement. That doesn't take away anything from Sanger, any more than Smith's racist behavior minimizes her achievements. It simply acknowledges that they were marked by America's original sin.
What will your statue look like? And are you sure others will like it? Think about that, the next time you want to take down someone else's. You might not like what you see.

Aretha Franklin's soulful and uplifting '72 concert; 'Amazing Grace' ****

Texto completo: A massive rookie mistake - director Sydney Pollack and his 16 millimeter film crew forgot to use a clapperboard synchronizing the sound with the image for each new take - delivered roughly 20 hours of footage captured for the 1972 Aretha Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace" into a maddening purgatory. There it stayed for nearly half a century.
But now it's here. For a concert movie of straightforward, self-effacing technique, "Amazing Grace" delivers one of the purest, most concentrated blasts of satisfaction in a long, long time. Franklin was 29 at the time she recorded the best-selling gospel album in history. For anyone who grew up with the double album on the stereo, seeing her record renditions of the title song, Marvin Gaye's "Wholy Holy" and so many more will bring them closer to what they already adore.
For sinful newcomers to the album, it's 87 minutes of better late than never.
Franklin recorded with the 25-member Southern California Community Choir, inside the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the LA neighborhood of Watts. Backed by a four-piece band, Franklin, the super-smooth Rev. James Cleveland (on screen nearly as much as Franklin) and exuberant choir director Alexander Hamilton's singers split the session into two evenings.
The second night brought, among others, Mick Jagger into the church. He's seen, fleetingly, sitting in the back; Pollack and his crew can be seen in "Amazing Grace" hustling, weaving around, trying to get as close to the music and what it meant for those people, in that church, on those nights.
The close-ups say it all. Beads of sweat intermingle with Franklin's blue eye shadow, and at times she seems to be blinking back tears. This is hard work in a place of worship; the joy it brings out in the crowd is the undeniable result.
The call-outs, spontaneous bursts of dance and shouts of affirmation from the choir and the audience, especially during "Amazing Grace" but throughout the entire film, serve as a glorious reminder that sometimes all a filmmaker needs to do is be there, and be awake and responsive to the talent.
"Amazing Grace" finally fell together thanks to the tireless efforts of producer and music executive Alan Elliott. Near the end of her life, Franklin sued and was granted an emergency injunction against the finished film's planned 2015 unveiling at the Telluride Film Festival. Shortly after Franklin's death last year, Elliott came to an agreement with Franklin's estate for the release.
There are a hundred little stories going on in "Amazing Grace," some unrelated to the music. Bassist Chuck Rainey told The New York Times recently that Franklin felt marginalized by her own movie, probably owing to the screen time afforded Cleveland (her childhood mentor) and, on the second night, the big-footing presence of her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin. His imposing, vaguely patronizing speech seems to turn Franklin into a meeker, compliant version of her adult self.
Even if Aretha Franklin doesn't dominate every second of "Amazing Grace," she's indisputably the reason the film exists, and the reason it's so good. Her voice could lift people straight out of their seats in jubilation; her vocal flourishes and deep readings of the simplest, most elemental lyrics remain incomparable. When she sings "my soul is satisfied," she's speaking for anyone listening to what she achieved here, in this Watts church with the walls painted various shades of blue, like countless prom tuxes of the era. "Satisfying" doesn't really do it justice, but it's a start.

Biden enters 2020 race, with his focus already on Trump

Texto completo: Reelecting president would permanently mar the country, he says
Former vice president Joe Biden opened his third campaign for the presidency on Thursday, taking direct aim at President Trump and declaring that "we are in the battle for the soul of this nation."
In a video posted on social media, Biden recounted the deadly clash between white supremacists and counterprotesters at a 2017 gathering in Charlottesville, after which Trump said there were "some very fine people on both sides."
"In that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had seen in our lifetime," Biden said, adding: "The core values of this nation - our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America - is at stake. That's why today I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States."
As he joined a crowded Democratic field in which many candidates have staked out progressive positions on an array of issues, Biden made no mention of policy specifics in the 3 1/2 -minute video, which also stood out for how directly he confronted Trump.
Biden, 76, who served for eight years as the second-in-command to the last Democrat to successfully seek the presidency, holds a strong position in early polls, but the trajectory of his campaign is uncertain.
Biden made his announcement hours before a major campaign fundraiser was to take place in Philadelphia. His first campaign event, union-themed, is planned Monday in Pittsburgh, a Democratic city whose suburbs and exurbs are filled with the sort of voters who abandoned the Democratic Party to side with Trump in 2016.
After that, his campaign said, Biden will travel to several early nominating states. Biden, who made his first bid for the White House more than 30 years ago, is scheduled to appear Friday on "The View," in what the ABC program said in a tweet would be his first sit-down interview since announcing his candidacy.
Trump responded to Biden's entrance about two hours after he announced.
"Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe," he wrote on Twitter. "I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!"
Biden's announcement day also faced a distraction from rare public comments by Anita Hill, the law professor who had accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in hearings in 1991 that Biden directed as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Biden has long been criticized for the committee's treatment of Hill. In an interview with the New York Times, Hill said she could not support his campaign.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,'" she said. A senior campaign aide confirmed Thursday that Biden had talked with Hill but disclosed no other details.
A Democratic force for nearly five decades, Biden built his career as a campaigner on his connection with working-class voters, including white voters he has sometimes called "the ethnic vote" - Midwestern Irish, Italian and Polish Catholics, or South Florida Jews. His campaign style tends toward the populism of Franklin Roosevelt, railing against those with money and power who he claims work against the needs of middle-class Americans.
"They don't understand us middle-class folks," Biden thundered repeatedly from the stump in 2012, when he was campaigning against then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney.
After Trump's election in 2016, Biden made clear that he believed the cause was a failure by Democrats to connect with working voters.
"You didn't hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly line making 60,000 bucks a year and a wife making $32,000 as a hostess in restaurant," he said in a 2017 appearance at the University of Pennsylvania.
At the same time, Biden also is expected to play up - and benefit from - his tenure as vice president to the nation's first black president. In early polling, Biden has been popular among black voters, who make up a dominant Democratic voting bloc in many states. Former president Barack Obama has indicated, however, that he will not make an early endorsement in the race.
Speaking briefly to reporters Thursday at the Amtrak station in Wilmington, Del., Biden said he had asked Obama not to make an endorsement in the Democratic nominating contest.
"Whoever wins the nomination should win it on their own merits," Biden said.
He later made an appearance at a Wilmington restaurant where he ordered a pepperoni pizza to go and mingled with patrons. On the way out, he was asked by a reporter if he had a message for the world.
"America's coming back like we used to be - ethical, straight, telling the truth . . . supporting our allies, all those good things," Biden said.
As he finalized his run, Biden was buffeted by scrutiny for a wide range of positions that, in some cases, were in line with Democratic orthodoxy long ago but are now out of step - a circumstance that may presage what awaits him in the campaign.
Those include support for antibusing legislation in the 1970s, his role handling the Hill testimony and his arm-twisting on behalf of a crime bill in the 1990s. He has attempted to address some of those issues in recent weeks but has often stumbled.
He has also come under criticism in recent weeks for his hands-on style. Several women have said made he them feel uncomfortable with hugs, pressing his forehead against theirs, or, in one case, smelling a Nevada politician's hair.
Biden posted a video saying that "social norms are changing" and that he would be "much more mindful." Two days later, however, he twice joked about the complaints during a speech to union workers.
Biden considered a late entry into the 2016 Democratic nomination fight, as a challenger to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, but decided against it as he mourned the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer at age 46. He later wrote a book explaining his decision as a personal one based on his emotional turmoil after his son's death.
Biden's earlier presidential races were disappointments. His first run, in 1988, was derailed by scandal when it was revealed that he had lifted parts of his stump speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, among others. Two decades later, Biden cast himself in his second presidential run as the most experienced Democratic candidate in the field, especially on matters of national security.
Biden won less than 1 percent of the delegates in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, however, and dropped out of the race shortly afterward. Seven months later, Obama selected him as his running mate, a credit both to Biden's experience as an inside player in Washington and to his perceived appeal among Midwestern voters.
In the White House, he was a constant presence in decision meetings, weighing in with Obama on a broad range of issues. He was also given special briefs, including the implementation of the 2009 stimulus bill, a failed effort to change gun laws after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and as a lead White House negotiator with congressional Republicans during budgetary standoffs.
First elected to the U.S. Senate by Delaware voters in 1972, at the age of 29, Biden went on to five reelections, serving as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee during contentious confirmation battles over Supreme Court nominees Thomas and Robert H. Bork, and as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Like Clinton, he voted as a senator in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which cleared the way for a war launched by President George W. Bush. Biden later said he regretted the vote.
But his attention Thursday fixed on another Republican president, Trump.
Biden said that he believed a single term for Trump would be "an aberrant moment in time."
"But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation - who we are - and I cannot stand by and watch that happen," he said.

Texto completo: When Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, ran for president in the 2008 GOP primary, many evangelical Christian voters were reluctant - putting it mildly - to support him, because of his membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
One of Romney's opponents, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, exploited this hesitance by trying to instill fear about the differences between himself and Romney: "Don't Mormons," Huckabee trolled in a New York Times Magazine interview, "believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers?" (Though real theological differences exist, that was not one of them.) At the 2007 Values Voter Summit, Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher, told the crowd they ought to back a candidate who speaks "the language of Zion as a mother tongue."
I was there that day, and swallowed hard as the crowd, full of anti-Romney fervor, cheered. Was this what Christians were about? Making theology a political litmus test struck me as terribly misguided, especially since Christians, more and more, find ourselves at the short of end of that stick. Yet, when this evangelical crowd had a chance to mock a good man for his beliefs, they relished the opportunity.
My husband and I, members of the Presbyterian Church of America and Republicans at the time, should've been welcomed by the "values" voters. After getting to know Romney and his wife Ann Romney, when I worked on a book project with her in 2007, we threw our support behind them and suddenly became the target of evangelical ire. One political activist saw me wearing a Romney campaign hat and angrily said, "You obviously don't love America," leaving me in near tears, since my husband was just days from deploying to Iraq. She would later become a vocal Trump supporter.
Romney won the GOP nomination four years later, but neither he nor Huckabee ever became president. Nearly a decade later, evangelical Republican voters embraced Donald Trump despite his well-documented flaws, sins and lack of repentance. Throughout his career, Romney has stood for strong moral values, sometimes at great personal and political cost, but he's never been Christian enough for some Republicans. Somehow, after everything we've seen, President Donald Trump still is.
Last week, Romney reacted to the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's report with disgust. One might even describe it as righteous indignation. He conceded that Mueller found no basis to charge the president with a federal crime, but tweeted that he was "sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President." It's the response you would expect from a political leader, of any or no faith, who holds honesty and accountability as important civic values. Yet few evangelical leaders expressed any outrage, or even mild disappointment.
In fact, Huckabee lashed out at Romney, not Trump, tweeting that it "makes me sick that you got GOP nomination and could have been POTUS" - a statement that seeks both to diminish the president's moral accountability and undermine anyone trying to hold the president to account. It's a cheap shot implying the only thing we should expect from our leaders is that they walk narrowly within the confines of the law, and not that they should be held to a higher, or even basic, moral standard. It also reveals the insincerity with which Huckabee and others once claimed that Christian values should be central in the selection of a president.
Isaiah 5:20 speaks directly to Huckabee and the rest of Trump's evangelical defenders: "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" Their "mother tongue," it turned out, wasn't the "language of Zion," but crass expediency, molding their definition of Christian values to suit their needs in a quest for power over principle.
Take, for instance, Robert Jeffress, an influential pastor of a Dallas megachurch. "Do we want a candidate who is a good, moral person," he asked at the 2011 Values Voter Summit, "or one who is a born-again follower of the Lord Jesus Christ?" He said it was "imperative to vote for a Christian" and said voting for Romney would give credibility to a "cult." Televangelist Bill Keller said that "a Romney election will help insure at least 1 million souls will burn in hell."
At the time, too few evangelical leaders denounced this fearful, denigrating rhetoric (though Jeffress, in calculating fashion, came around to endorsing Romney in the general election, saying President Barack Obama "opposes Biblical principles") and some Christians sat it out, holding that their religious views prohibited them from supporting anyone but the holiest of candidates. But four years later, when Trump erupted onto the political scene, the same leaders abandoned their religious litmus tests faster than you could say "grab 'em by the p----."
Huckabee endorsed Trump in 2016, and his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, serves as Trump's White House press secretary. She told the Christian Broadcast Network earlier this year that God "wanted Donald Trump to become president" because he supported "a lot of the things that people of faith really care about." And while truth is one of the things that, presumably, Christians really care about, she admitted to Mueller that "in the heat of the moment," she made up disparaging information about former FBI director James Comey as an excuse for his firing.
Jeffress became a Trump apologist, even defending Trump after Michael Cohen alleged that Trump was aware Cohen paid hush-money to mistresses on Trump's behalf. When Trump bemoaned immigrants coming from what he reportedly described as "s---hole countries," Jeffress was offended only by Trump's profanity, not his heartless xenophobia, saying, "Apart from the vocabulary attributed to him, President Trump is right on target in his sentiment."
Yet Trump's sentiments, actions and character are opposed to the biblical values these evangelicals claimed to demand in a candidate. Instead of striving to be "poor in spirit," as Matthew 5:3 commends, he talks endlessly about his material wealth. Instead of being respectful, he is arrogant. Instead of thirsting for righteousness, he has bragged about his affairs. Instead of being a peacemaker, he chooses words that polarize and divide. Instead of respecting women, he has gleefully described himself as a sexual assaulter. Instead of accepting God's forgiveness, he claims he doesn't need it.
If evangelical leaders really demanded Christian values in their president, they'd stop calling evil good and good evil. They might also be ashamed that LDS Romney stands up for Christian values more than Trump and his sycophants combined.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly 200 times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction of justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia — evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Turning the Page on Tech for Tech's Sake

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Pamela Paul, editor of The New York Times Book Review, discussed the tech she's using.
About two years ago, you wrote an article about how you downgraded all your tech . How did you downgrade? What do you love about having done that?
It's easier than you might think because you can pretty effectively downgrade merely by neglecting to upgrade. You just naturally find yourself sliding backward. In my case, this shift has been deliberate, but more about making a mental adjustment than about deactivating existing technology. (Though I did permanently jettison the electric toothbrush.)
There's a prevailing assumption that just because there's a new high-tech version of something previously handled in a low-tech way, one should adopt that technology. I come at it from a different angle, which is to start with the need or problem and ask myself: Will this new technology substantively help? And if the upside is speed or information, my next question is: What's the trade-off? What do I lose along with this gain, and on balance, do the gains outweigh the losses? (Possibly the only thing I learned from Econ 111.)
Quite often, I find that it doesn't. What lands in the loss column may have to do with process, and the process of doing something can be just as valuable as the end result. I read this book last year, "Cræft: An Inquiry Into the Origins and True Meaning of Traditional Crafts." I am in no way crafty, but this book had me yearning to thatch my own roof just to be in touch with the physical and attendant mental labor of putting something useful together. (That said, I haven't lifted a finger.)
On the flip side, I find that many new technologies are actually far less efficient than the tools they attempt to replace. A Nook or a Kindle or iPad is, for my purposes, unequivocally worse than a printed book. You can't flip back and forth to the photo inserts or skim easily through the index; you have no sense of page count (percentages, really?). You lose the design of the product, which is often beautiful, down to the weight of the paper and the choice of typeface. You'd have to pay me a very fancy salary to give up print for a year.
Same thing with paper calendars; they're just better. I get irrationally impatient with the slowness with which people tap meetings into their calendars on the phone. It is at least 30 seconds faster to write it in an old-timey agenda (Levenger here). My Google calendar will always play second fiddle to this far more detailed agenda, supplemented by Post-its and a Moleskine to-do list. I trace this obsession with efficiency to the children's book "Cheaper by the Dozen," about a couple of efficiency experts and their brood, which I took way too literally.
Given all this, what does your tech setup look like for doing your work?
My personal life, techwise, operates in sharp contrast to and in part as ballast against my professional life. Despite working on what one might consider the most low-tech of beats, we are in a tech-oriented workplace, and our content is delivered through high-tech platforms to tech-savvy readers.
That means doing everything I can while at work to understand, adopt and assess the same tools our newsroom colleagues and our readers are using, and figure out how they can materially enhance our journalism. We were actually the first desk to have a podcast (now in its 15th year) and are part of the pilot program for Alexa, which adapts our audio content for voice users. While at work, I have 12 windows and tabs open, toggling madly between laptop and phone like every other digital drone.
As an aside: I have the ugliest but best low-tech phone case for klutzes like me who drop their phones all the time. It costs 3 euros from Ale-Hop in Madrid, and you can order it online. You will look ridiculous carrying it around but triumphant picking it up.
What's your advice for others who want to downgrade their tech?
In general, when I hear the phrase "There's an app for that," my first question is, "Does there need to be?" The vast majority of new technologies are developed with a profit motive. So each new form of tech raises the question: Is this something I'm willing to pay for, whether the cost is in terms of dollars or privacy? Like many people, I chafe at the notion of my personal life being monetized.
How has the book industry's shift toward digital publishing changed the way that The Times reviews books? And what hasn't changed?
Strictly in terms of review process, our desk hasn't changed much -- because the vast majority of our editors and reviewers prefer to work in print.
It's easier for an editor to assess a book without reading it in its entirety by dipping in and out. Reviewers like to mark up their galleys, which are early review copies.
That said, PDFs make fact-checking far easier and speed our process for embargoed books. We can also see early editions of visual books that aren't available in galleys (the printing costs are too high) without having to wait for finished physical copies. And we can more readily get access to audiobooks digitally than we ever could with CDs.
Outside of work, what low-tech product are you currently obsessed with?
I am fairly confident that I'm the last DVD subscriber to what was once called Netflix and is now DVD.com, and my queue is maxed to the 500. I don't subscribe to any streaming services, nor does our television have an antenna set up for network TV.
This makes my decision around what to watch really easy: There are only four choices. When I go somewhere with multiple streaming subscriptions, there's actually nothing I want to watch. As Barry Schwartz wrote in his persuasive 2004 book, "The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less," we become easily overwhelmed and paralyzed when faced with too many possibilities (at least I do). It's also easier to find old and foreign movies on DVD.
I do, however, like tech that narrows choice down. One app we recently used with much success was Happy Cow, which locates vegan dining options. It was seriously useful while traveling in Germany last summer with our 13-year-old vegan daughter.
I still regret uploading all my CDs at the behest of my husband, who is far techier than I am. Recently, I bought portable CD players for two of my kids. I think about digging out the vinyl again. Maybe I'll pick up a "new" record player one of these days.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation failed to establish evidence the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election.

Yet many journalists who covered the collusion narrative now say the Mueller report vindicates how they and their newsrooms pursued the story. Even though their coverage left the distinct impression that there would be a there there, these journalists suggest the report is the final word against critics who say the press consistently mishandled the story for two years.

“[I]t's worth noting that the report confirms a lot of the reporting by NYT, WaPo and others about the president's actions, many of which he or his advisers denied in real time,” boasted the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman.

CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz also said the Mueller report has "really corroborated a lot of the good journalism that was done."

“For all the hand-wringing about overzealous punditry, the Mueller report was by and large an affirmation of the mainstream media’s investigative reporting," said the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake. "Almost all the big stories were confirmed in the report."

I have written already that these public boasts are not wrong (though it is depressing to see there has been no similar public acknowledgment from journalists and commentators for what the press got wrong). They are correct to say the report confirms some of the press’ coverage of the collusion story. But is this back-patting justified? Hardly. The idea that Mueller report is "total exoneration" for the national media's at-times reckless and unethical pursuit of the collusion narrative is really a bit much.

First, which stories did newsrooms even get right? For the answer to that, we turn to Blake, who listed a handful of now-confirmed articles, including the ones that claimed that:

"President Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, asked FBI Director James B. Comey for leniency on Michael Flynn, invited Comey to the White House where Comey said Trump asked him for loyalty, was pursuing business dealings in Russia in 2016 and was behind Donald Trump Jr.’s misleading explanations of the Trump Tower meeting. Other stories that proved ahead of their time included the digging into Paul Manafort’s foreign entanglements, Flynn being vulnerable to blackmail for lying to the White House, Trump asking intelligence chiefs and others to clear him in the Russia probe, Manafort meeting with a Russia-tied business associate during the campaign and the Trump team encouraging potential back channels with Russia."

These reports look great in the wake of the release of the Mueller report. But I would argue they do not offset the botched Russia reporting that also came out in that same period. Every bungled “bombshell," and there were many, alleging or even suggesting a smoking gun on Trump's collusion with Russia is worth 100 accurate but deep-in-the-weeds stories about Manafort’s unrelated “foreign entanglements.” It takes only one major false news report to cast a shadow over everything else, because batting .900 in journalism is bad enough to get most people fired.

It is also facile to claim you got it right on things such as Trump’s loyalty pledge or his business dealings in Russia, while also ignoring your nonsense story about how Trump directed Michael Flynn to contact the Russians during the election, or that he had suborned perjury from his personal attorney. It is a bit like bragging about passing yards in a game where you threw six interceptions that were returned for touchdowns.

A newsroom devaluing its own credibility with bogus stories and undeserved pats on the back is no small matter, especially considering where public trust in the press is at this moment.

But the main point is that the collusion story, hotly and often recklessly pursued, and enthusiastically supported by the opinion side of the news industry, turned out to be a bust. The Mueller investigation came back with no evidence of collusion after two years, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews. People won Pulitzers for a story that ultimately fizzled out and left no trace. The overall story was false, and yet journalists are out here patting themselves on the back for getting some details right, such as Trump asking former FBI Director James Comey for his loyalty.

And anyone who claims the press merely went where it was led, that it did not implicitly endorse the collusion theory with its coverage, is either lying or ignorant. Even the reports that turned out to be accurate were written with an eye toward proving something bigger, which, by the way, turned out to be not so. The wannabe Woodwards and Bernsteins thought they were going to bring down a president.

Take, as just one example, the falsely framed "bombshell" story about Jeff Sessions' failure to disclose two meetings he took with a Russian envoy when he was a senator. It very strongly implies that the Kremlin may have infiltrated the U.S. government, when in fact it had no significance at all, as Sessions had been instructed by the FBI to leave out meetings taken while in the Senate.

Reporters can claim that such stories were not written in service of advancing the collusion narrative, but then they would have to explain why these stories were written at all.

IN TRUMP'S AMERICA, THE LEFT DIDN'T START THE FIRE

Texto completo: Some longtime friends and I often find ourselves in some version of the same conversation about Donald Trump's America.
Little is said about the president himself; it is stipulated that he is a despicable liar, an abomination. In the most important ways, he is the polar opposite of Dwight Eisenhower, the first Republican president of our baby boom generation. Ike made sacrifices, exhibited heroism, had a sense of duty, was devoted to the common good, and possessed personal integrity. Trump seems to revel in eschewing such behaviors.
But instead of dwelling on Trump, we talk about how wrong we may have been about the country itself.
Each of us has long viewed America as a noble, democratic land of opportunity. We thought we were gradually moving beyond a troubled racial history. We saw people of color and women as making consistent if gradual strides. We believed that there was more to unite us as Americans than to divide us. We believed in a common economic good.
Yes, there were the haters, racists, white nationalists, ignoramuses, however one describes them, but they lurked in the shadows of decent society, scorned as losers and seldom heard from before the internet.
And then 2016 happened.
The nation we thought we knew proved itself capable of electing Trump. And now most of his supporters apparently stand behind him from one obscene news cycle to the next.
It makes us wonder if we simply had been naïve all along. This spirit of self-reflection is driven less by fury than by a sad bewilderment.
The thing is, the media talks about how rage across the American political landscape was ignited and now fueled from both sides of the ideological spectrum. It is this notion of "bothsidesism" that bothers us.
This concept of a misguided bothsidesism was best defined in a New York Times column during the 2016 campaign by Paul Krugman, headlined "Both Sides Now?"
In it, he contended Trump was a demonstrable liar and an awful candidate, but the media had adopted bothsidesism, which he defined as "the almost pathological determination to portray politicians and their programs as being equally good or equally bad, no matter how ludicrous that pretense becomes." Krugman alternately described it as the "cult of balance" and the practice of "false equivalency."
That most of today's political rage emanates from the right seems obvious to many of us.
Beyond dispute, I think, is that middle-aged and older white men make up the critical mass of this Trump-enabled base of resentment. After Trump's victory shocked the national media, we have been treated to more than two years of news stories from the hinterlands about how these guys think the rest of us discarded them and didn't care.
They complained about "line-cutters" - pretty much anyone who is not white and male - and how "those people" undercut their rightful status at the top of any pecking order. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has reinforced this attitude, and when the rest of us pushed back against the demonizing of vulnerable groups, we were dismissed with that all-purpose indictment of being "politically correct."
Granted, there certainly are plenty of such men for whom the American Dream is in tatters.
As deindustrialization and globalization ravaged factories, the right cleverly succeeded in convincing the working class to blame effete intellectualism on the left instead of the rapacious capitalism of the right. The right has thus far won the argument, in part, because it's easier to sell self-interest sprinkled with racial and gender resentment than altruistic notions of a we're-all-in-it-together common good.
You might think, with their hero in the White House, that these Trump backers would now seem happier, but you'd be wrong. They seem as angry and aggrieved as ever, led by their hero Trump, the enemy of their enemies.
Yet we always seem to be told that this ferocious anger comes roughly equally from both sides.
In a New York Times analysis last month headlined "No Hate Left Behind," Thomas B. Edsall cited polling showing that disdain for political foes was worsening, or, as he put it, becoming more "lethal." He cited a poll in which 42 percent of people in each party viewed opponents as "downright evil," that about 20 percent thought members of the other party "lack the traits to be considered fully human." About the same number thought the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition died.
Edsall called this dangerous territory, and the author and psychologist Jonathan Haight, quoted in Edsall's piece, predicted things will worsen. Haight cited how social media is "drowning us in outrage" while trust in institutions is further declining.
Along similar lines, a recent magazine article in The Atlantic was headlined: "The Real Roots of American Rage." In it, Charles Duhigg, an author and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, wrote that as recently as 2012, fewer than half of voters were deeply angry at the other side's presidential nominee. By 2016, that figure approached 70 percent.
In explaining the roots of the anger, Duhigg chronicled how the country has "corporatized" outrage. A former Fox News producer told Duhigg that his network realized that anger was entertaining and that hearing one's indignations given voice by a bombastic host was irresistible.
Duhigg implored readers to turn anger toward change: "Ours could be a moment for progress, if we can channel our anger to good ends, rather than the vanquishing of our enemies."
Though both articles were perceptive, both seemed to imply shared blame - even equal blame - for today's incendiary political landscape.
People in my ideological posse are saddened, confused, and yes, bewildered, by Trump's outsized appeal to working-class Americans when he, in fact, consistently puts the interests of the one-percenters over working people.
But we are not, for the most part, filled with anger toward fellow Americans seeking a pathway to a better future for their children and grandchildren.
Despite the bothsidesism, the hateful emotions in politics are not at all equivalent.

Texto completo: #UhOh. To Democratic presidential candidates posting their avocado toast recipes on Twitter, here’s some bad news. The online primary you’re conspicuously trying to win incisive-tweet-by-incisive-tweet in no way resembles the real world of voters who cast actual ballots to choose flesh-and-blood delegates in state primaries and caucuses.
So says the impeccably nonpartisan, nonideological More in Common organization in their survey of 8,000 Americans on their political views and habits, including use of social media. As anyone (like me) who spends way too much time on Twitter proving how clever we are knows, there are very few moderates and mainstream progressives prowling the virtual Twitter jungle. The Twitterverse is best suited for stridency, ideological extremes and virtual shaming.
As Democratic 2020 hopefuls play to the Twitter crowd, the stridency and shaming is not the problem. It is those on the ideological extremes who reward candidates for taking positions that will doom them in the general election against President Donald Trump — and may punish them first in the primaries, where “the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate,” as Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy write in The New York Times.
Read more commentary:
Make a serious case for capitalism, or millennials will keep flirting with socialism
2020 Democrats should test their mettle in a Fox News debate instead of running scared
Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.
As the More in Common study points out, Democrats who do not post political content on social media are half as likely to self-identify as moderates (29% compared with 53% of other Democrats) and half as likely to be African-American (11% to 24%). Those who do post political content are four times more likely to have attended a political protest (28% to 7%), and three times as likely to have donated to a campaign (45% to 14%). But they are also a far smaller group, outnumbered about 2 to 1 — proving that volume in decibels is not the same as volume in size.
Twitter users are few and far to the left
We found the same thing in our March poll of 1,200 likely Democratic primary voters. Just 10% in our survey were frequent Twitter users, while 73% don’t use Twitter at all. Predictably, this small cadre of Twitter users stood far to the left of those who skip the social media platform. While 34% of Twitter users in our survey prefer a Democratic nominee who identifies as a democratic socialist, just 19% of non-Twitter users agree. While 33% of Twitter users want the nominee to move further left to excite the base, only 17% of non-Twitter users agree.
And Twitter users are roughly 20 points more favorable than non-Twitter users on some of the most progressive policy proposals under discussion, like single-payer health care, abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and a guaranteed federal job.
With no real election barometers beyond quarterly fundraising reports between now and the Iowa caucuses, the primary contest has devolved into the number of Twitter followers, viral moments and online likes that candidates are generating. And while it’s true that “likes” can turn into online donations that can add up and really matter in a campaign, there is a price for turning likes into loves: taking positions that work like a charm online but could reelect Trump.
Bandwagons like Medicare for All are risky
There may be no better example than "Medicare for All," which has become an online litmus test sensation. By now, most of us are aware how support for Medicare for All crumbles when voters of all ideologies hear critiques. This is why practically no Democrat who competed in 2018 in a swing congressional district ran on it. Yet despite myriad progressive health care plans to cover everyone, Democratic presidential hopefuls are twisting themselves into Gordian knots to demonstrate their simultaneous support and reluctance for Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan. Thank you, Twitter.
This is not going unnoticed by Republicans. Steven Law, who runs a GOP super PAC for Senate races, warned that Democratic candidates “can try to hide, but we will make certain voters understand that Democrats are lining up behind abolishing private insurance, ruining Medicare, restricting medical choices, raising taxes on hardworking families, and exploding the deficit. ” Normally, charges like this in Republican ads don’t work. But if we follow the whims of the Twitterverse, they might.
The temptation for Democratic candidates to hew to the left to win the online primary will be immense. But going viral could be lethal. A virtual victory could lead to an actual defeat in the real-world general election and the primary. Hearing the voices not on Twitter is the way to win.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- The heiress Abigail Disney made headlines on Monday after she harshly criticized the company founded by her great-uncle on Twitter. On Tuesday she escalated her attack, writing in an opinion column about what she called the "naked indecency" of the company's pay practices.
Ms. Disney's column, which carried the headline "It's time to call out my family's company -- and anyone else rich off their workers' backs," was published by The Washington Post. In it she excoriated the Walt Disney Company for awarding its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, a pay package in 2018 worth $ 65 million. She also cited a union-sponsored study showing that the package was 1,400 times that of the median Disney worker and called for Disney to "reward all your workers fairly."
(Mr. Iger's pay was made up of $ 39.3 million in annual compensation, with restricted stock awards tied to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets making up the balance.)
Disney aggressively disputed Ms. Disney's assertions.
"Disney has made historic investments to expand the earning potential and upward mobility of our workers, implementing a starting hourly wage of $ 15 at Disneyland that's double the federal minimum wage," the company said in a statement. It added that the company had committed up to $ 150 million for an education initiative that gives hourly employees the opportunity to obtain a college or vocational degree at no cost.
The company's statement noted that 90 percent of Mr. Iger's compensation was based on financial performance and that, under Mr. Iger's watch, Disney's stock price had risen to $ 133 a share from $ 24 -- "which directly benefits the literally thousands of employees who hold our stock."
Ms. Disney posted several tweet storms on Sunday in which she fulminated about Disney's "rock-bottom wages" for entry-level workers and called Mr. Iger's pay "insane."
Ms. Disney is a granddaughter of Roy O. Disney, who founded Disney in 1923 with his brother, Walt Disney. The Disney family has not been involved in managing the company since Roy E. Disney, Ms. Disney's father, stepped down from the board in 2003. He subsequently led a shareholder revolt that led to Michael D. Eisner's resignation and Mr. Iger's ascendance. Roy E. Disney died in 2009.
In her opinion article and Twitter posts, Ms. Disney made it clear that her opinions were her own and that she was not speaking on behalf of the broader Disney family. In the past, her relatives have sometimes chafed at her public comments about the company and her great-uncle. In 2014, when she called Walt Disney a misogynist on Facebook, igniting a controversy, she told The New York Times: "I regret it. I got my family all angry at me."
Ms. Disney is a philanthropist and the director of a 2014 documentary, "The Armor of Light," that follows an anti-abortion activist and a supporter of abortion rights. She has also produced films like "Pray the Devil Back to Hell," about a coalition of Christian and Muslim women in Liberia.
Most recently, Ms. Disney has been a founder of Level Forward, a start-up that backs media projects -- films, stage shows, podcasts -- driven by women and people of color.

Texto completo: It seems that the only thing Americans can agree on is that we are living in an era of extreme political polarization. As we head into the 2020 presidential campaign, a striking 91 percent of people said in a recent PRRI survey that the country is divided over politics. This is higher than the percentage of people who reported that America is divided over issues of race and ethnicity (83 percent) or religion (77 percent).
Democrats and Republicans have long disagreed over policies, but in recent years the disagreement has turned personal. In that PRRI poll, more people were displeased by the thought that their child would marry someone of a different political party than of a different religion.
Worrying about decades of Thanksgiving dinners with relatives who support the other party might sound like clear evidence that America is hopelessly, alarmingly divided.
But there’s also a growing body of evidence that we’re overstating the divide. The real issue, it turns out, might not be with polarization. It might just be that most people really don’t like politics. Americans are open to people with all sorts of political and partisan opinions, our research shows — as long as they keep those opinions to themselves.
We conducted a series of experiments and surveys with more than 6,000 people during the 2016 and 2018 national elections. Like other recent polls and surveys, ours asked people whether they would be happy or unhappy if they had a child who married someone from the opposing party, Republican or Democratic.
But we added a new piece of information to this question, which said how often that new in-law would talk about politics. When people learned that their future in-law would rarely discuss politics, fewer than 30 percent said that they would be unhappy with an in-law from the opposing party. On the other hand, when we specified that the hypothetical in-law would never shut up about politics — he or she would interrupt social gatherings and holidays with the latest Trump dirt from MSNBC or Hannity tirade from Fox — more than 40 percent of people would be unhappy with the marriage.
This is especially true for those who do not strongly identify with a party, which includes nearly two-thirds of Americans. In this group, fewer than 20 percent said they would be unhappy with an in-law from the opposing party who rarely discussed politics. When, instead, their child’s chosen partner was a talkative member of the opposing party, this number doubled to 40 percent.
Polarization, however, is not just about disliking the other side. True polarization is when you dislike the other party and really like your own party. Most people do not care enough about politics to say they are “happy” simply because their child is marrying someone from their political party. So when people in our studies were asked to consider a future in-law who rarely discussed politics, only 15 percent could be considered truly polarized. While this number grew to 25 percent among people who have strong connections to their party, it shrank to 10 percent of weak partisans.
Polarization is also low among weak partisans when they are told that the in-law will frequently talk about politics. Weak partisans aren’t happy with an in-law from the opposing party discussing politics, but many are just as unhappy with an in-law from their own party who insists on political conversation.
Other studies suggest, much like ours, that somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of Americans are truly polarized. In the 2018 American Family Survey, for example, only 21 percent of participants reported that it was important for a married couple to be of the same party. Meanwhile, 81 percent said agreement in feelings about children was pivotal to a marriage.
Looking beyond marriage, a survey conducted by The New York Times found that only 16 percent of people placed their political party membership among the top three terms they used to describe themselves. When the political scientists James Druckman and Matthew Levendusky asked Americans to rank six identities in the order of personal importance, partisanship tied for last (alongside class).
If only a minority of people are polarized, why do 87 percent of Americans think, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey, political polarization is “threatening” to the American way of life? It may be about how we talk about politics.
Those who are most polarized also have the strongest connection to their party. A survey we conducted during the 2018 election suggests that these people are also most likely to be vocal about their political opinions. For example, the polarized are twice as likely to say they post on social media about politics. These people have deep partisan connections — and some can become what the political scientist Eitan Hersh terms “political hobbyists”: emotionally invested in political outcomes, loud and persistent. It is not difficult to imagine how these voices can ruin an otherwise enjoyable Thanksgiving celebration.
The polarized also get the most media attention. Compared with the year 2000, today one can expect to see 20 percent more stories about polarization in the news.
This amplification of the polarized can leave people weary of the opposing party. If the polarized are who comes to mind when Americans imagine a partisan, it is no wonder these Americans aren’t excited about that new in-law who supports the other party.
But this hesitation is not the same as animosity and polarization. Some people might genuinely hate the other party. These people may get the most attention, but they are also outnumbered by the majority who just want to discuss other things than politics.

Texto completo: The Celtics are who we thought they were, the former N.F.L. coach Dennis Green might say. If you want to crown 'em, then crown their -- ah, never mind. But at least for the moment, Boston, after a methodical, workmanlike sweep of a resilient Indiana Pacers team in the first round, reflected the team that many preseason observers thought would waltz its way to the N.B.A. finals.
On one hand, this was the kind of series that should have been expected. Indiana, plenty scrappy during the season, was missing its best player, the flashy two-way swingman Victor Oladipo. Even with him, Indiana didn't have the top-shelf depth that Boston possesses. Boston wasn't quite dominant, but the series was rarely in doubt, especially with the Pacers' propensity for offensive droughts.
On the other hand, this is a Celtics team that was blown out several times by lesser teams during an underwhelming regular season that left many questioning how overrated they were in the first place. Of particular concern was the team's spectacular penchant for blowing leads. In a two-game stretch in February, Boston gave up an 18-point lead in a loss to the Lakers and a 28-point lead in a loss to the Clippers. Weeks later, the Celtics let a fourth-quarter lead of nearly 20 points dissipate against Charlotte. Several other times, Boston showed discontent, a lack of cohesion or effort, or all of the above.
[For the Celtics to shine, they need the Jayson Tatum who boomed on LeBron James.]
But against the Pacers, the Celtics played their best basketball in the fourth quarter. In Game 2, Boston came back from a double-digit deficit to overwhelm the Pacers by 32-12 in the last 12 minutes. The next game, the Celtics outscored the Pacers by 16-9 in the final six minutes. Finally, in the elimination game, the Celtics extended a 1-point lead entering the final frame to 11, before eventually winning by 110-106. The defensive rotations were like clockwork.
They did so with Kyrie Irving and Al Horford combining to shoot 8 for 32 from the field, and with neither hitting a shot in the last quarter. Instead, Gordon Hayward -- looking like the All-Star the Celtics were hoping for when they signed him -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier all pitched in to fill the gap, on offense and defense. Seven players reached double figures in scoring, and the vaunted depth that had been so touted in the preseason -- with five skill players on the court most of the time who can shoot, defend and create their own shot -- was on full display.
"They're a deep team," Pacers Coach Nate McMillan said in his postgame news conference. "They showed tonight that Irving is not the only player on that roster."
To that end, Irving's first playoff series with the Celtics was a mixed bag, at least in terms of his shooting. He exploded in Game 2 for 37 points on 26 shots. But in the other three games, Irving was just 17 for 49 from the field (35 percent) -- partly a result of the Pacers' defense keying on him.
The question now is which version of the Celtics will show up for the second round. The only way the Celtics don't face the Milwaukee Bucks next is if a meteor hits Earth. (I am legally obligated by the New York Times Standards Department to tell you that there is a chance the Detroit Pistons can come back and win that series. This won't happen. But rules are rules.)
The Bucks are a juggernaut, and the Celtics will need to play much better than they did against the Pacers in order to advance to the conference finals. Milwaukee had the league's best defense and were the fifth-best offensive team during the regular season. This is not a team likely to give up double-digit leads or have its offense disappear. The Celtics' margin of error will be minimal, and the occasional regressions they endured against Indiana would hand the series to Milwaukee.
The Bucks are led by one of the fearsome players in recent history, and the probable winner of this year's Most Valuable Player Award: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Coach Mike Budenholzer, building the team around Antetokounmpo, transformed the plodding Bucks, who were 20th in the N.B.A. in pace last year, into the league's fifth-fastest team. During the regular season, Milwaukee beat the Celtics twice in three matchups -- and the Bucks' defense flustered Irving, who had a .479 true shooting percentage across those games, well short of his season average of .592.
This is a vastly different Bucks team from the one the Celtics eliminated last year in seven games. But the Celtics are different as well. They have Irving, a player with serious postseason credentials, and Hayward. They won't have Marcus Smart, their dogged guard, for at least part of the series because of a quadriceps injury, which will hamper their defensive flexibility, but the team's depth should still be an advantage over Milwaukee. And the Celtics have evolved even since dropping that game against the Hornets in March.
For one thing, Hayward (who posted true shooting percentages of .644, .623, and .762 in February, March and April), is looking the best he has looked in a Celtics uniform. He's slashing with more confidence, and other than a vicious dunk by Myles Turner on Sunday, Hayward repeatedly challenged the bigger, younger Turner, getting past him for multiple difficult layups. Hayward, who finished with a team-leading 20 points off the bench, also had a strong dunk of his own, but it was wiped away because of an offensive foul.
"Physically, I feel way better now than I did at the beginning of the season," Hayward said after the game.
But he added that the uptick in the quality of his play was partly a result of familiarity: "I think more than anything, though, just having the reps and having experience with this team and getting a chance to play with these guys and start to figure out strengths."
So now the Celtics will embark on a task they haven't achieved all season: sustaining great play. If they can't pair their effort with the talent on the roster, the Bucks will devour them. By extension, this will alter the fate of several players on the roster who may find themselves on different teams next year.
As Brown told NBA TV in a postgame interview, "Everything is on the line right now."

Texto completo: Re-enacting a moment from his childhood, Paul Audia steadies an imaginary Eastman Kodak Brownie at his waist to take the first photographs of his career. "Oh, man," Audia says. "That little Brownie and seeing the magic of it. This is cool."
So is being the primary photographer for Pope Francis’ international best-selling book, "Sharing the Wisdom of Time."
"Every picture in that book has so much story behind it," says Audia, who lives in Wood Dale and spent months shooting photographs for the book in locations across the United States, Ireland, England, Malta, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Poland. His portraits include a local black woman who overcame prejudice to finish nursing school, a soccer player in Madrid who learned how hard work can overcome frustration, a Slovenian woman who talks about a life worth living as she rolls her wheelchair through the rain, and a Holocaust survivor who lives in Ohio and still works to curb hate.
"I like this book very much because it gives voice to people with years of experience. It lets them talk and tell their experiences," Pope Francis writes in the book’s preface. "I also liked looking at the images of their faces."
Most of those images are the result of Audia’s work.
"Our sincere gratitude goes to the man behind the camera, photographer Paul Audia, whose gift for capturing the dignity and majesty of a person shines through in each of his photos," reads the acknowledgment in the front of the book.
As a kid growing up in Fairmont, West Virginia, Audia photographed hometown hero and teenage gymnast Mary Lou Retton, who became famous at the 1984 Olympics as the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal.
Audia left West Virginia University early to start his career in radio, where he spent six years as an on-air personality, and worked as a disc jockey spinning disco tunes at nightclubs. But he also studied photography and became a member of the Professional Photographers of America.
He shot high school senior portraits, proms, weddings and ads for department stories and Iron City Beer. "I didn’t turn down anything," he remembers. One of his most difficult jobs was shooting photographs for Peabody Coal in a mine 600 feet underground, where lighting was an adventure. They shut down the mine for 10 minutes, and Audia captured three images on film. "The first was shaky. The second was almost perfect. The third was perfect," Audia remembers.
He has photographed Buddy Guy, Billy Corgan and other musicians and fashion models on runways in New York City and on cobblestone streets in Guatemala. "I was the king of bridal for about 12 years," he says. He’s captured faces from Barack Obama to Irish fishermen. He shoots video and photos for Access Community Health Network, a provider of health services across Cook and DuPage counties. He tells stories of some of his photos on his podcast. He’s married to Bonnie Reid, has two grown children and two grandkids.
"All the things you do previously in your life bring all those skills to that moment of life," Audia says in explaining how he captured images for the pope’s book. He was touched not only by the stories of older people but by the help he was offered from strangers in foreign lands whenever he needed directions or assistance, Audia says.
"To me, this book was life-altering," Audia says. "The stories I heard. The people who gave me love."
In 2015, Loyola Press published the first papal book for children: "Dear Pope Francis: The Pope Answers Letters from Children Around the World," which made The New York Times Best Sellers List. Jesuit Father Antonio Spadaro, editor-in-chief of the Italian Jesuit journal La CiviltÃ  Cattolica, visited the Chicago publisher in 2016. "He said the Holy Father had another idea," remembers Joellyn Cicciarelli, president and publisher of Loyola Press. "And we said OK."
Working with Jesuit groups and Unbound, a not-for-profit global anti-poverty organization with many programs that aid the elderly, the book gathered stories of elders imparting wisdom.
"These people were sharing raw stories and we needed a photographer to capture that," Cicciarelli says. The book’s designer, Jill Arena, had worked with Audia before and knew he’d be perfect for the job.
"I try to start out with a blank canvas. I start talking and try to get a feel for them," Audia says of his approach, which is the same for every person he meets.
Sitting next to filmmaker Martin Scorsese at the book’s release last October during the pope’s synod on youth in Rome, Audia says the director, who tells a story in the book, talked to Audia as if they were old friends about cameras, equipment and actors. Scorsese dropped names as if Audia were part of his Hollywood network. "I know Robert DeNiro, but I don’t know Bobby DeNiro," Audia says, laughing at the memory.
The book’s chapters deal with work, struggle, love, death and hope. "Sharing the Wisdom of Time" has been reprinted in nine languages in more than a dozen countries. It’s a coffee-table art book that reaches a diverse audience, some of whom Audia will photograph today in Michigan City, Indiana.
"I’m going to a prison on Easter Sunday," Audia says. "Several of the prisoners carry the book with them."

Texto completo: Legendary journalist Walter Lippmann had sources in the highest places in Washington. Some evenings would find Lippmann seated opposite President Franklin Roosevelt in the Oval Office and Roosevelt would toss a classified cable at Lippmann and ask: "What do you think?"
Lippmann would give his counsel, but not write about what he had read in that cable. He would not break that trust or, most certainly, destroy his most important relationship.
That kind of relationship between officials and journalists goes on every day in Washington and journalists still keep those confidences. It takes years to develop these kinds of relationships and veteran journalists will not blow up a source relationship for one headline that will soon be subsumed by the churn of the daily news cycle. This exchange of information helps those journalists understand what is happening and the American people benefit from that knowledge.
Conversely, one of my former ambassadors referred to Washington as the world’s largest colander, in that leaking is also a daily occurrence. People leak information — some of it classified — to journalists for a variety reasons. It might be a trial balloon or an effort to sabotage a potential policy. Or, sometimes it is just a matter of ego. "Look what I know!"
Roosevelt expected Lippmann to respect the ground rules they had established over many years. Leakers, on the other hand, expect that the information they provide will be made public to achieve their aims whether it is pure politics or an attempt to blow the whistle on government activity that they believe is illegal or unethical.
WikiLeaks takes this philosophy to the extreme, based on the idea that no government secrets are sacred, and that distinction is at the core of the government’s case against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange. Interestingly, the Assange indictment is narrowly focused on his role in helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning attempt to crack a classified system — apparently unsuccessfully. It does not focus on WikiLeaks’ role in publishing thousands of classified cables.
Most assuredly, Justice Department lawyers understood that in the past the Supreme Court has staunchly defended the First Amendment rights of a free press to act as a check on the government. However, even journalists and free-press advocates are more than uncomfortable with Assange’s extreme methods and fear his case could be used to chip away at those rights.
The court’s support for the right of the press to publish leaked materials had one its most forceful expressions in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case (New York Times v. United States) when Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority 6-3 decision: "In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government’s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."
And … "The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security … ."
Manning might have thought of herself as justified in arranging for the publication of that information and clearly Assange gave little to no thought about the lives that might be put in danger — especially those who were cooperating with U.S. authorities in conflict zones in Afghanistan and Iraq — or the confidential diplomatic relationships that would be upended. Once leaked, major American media outlets published some of the revealed information, no doubt after consultations with their in-house attorneys.
However, as the extradition of Assange goes forward, the journalistic community in the United States will be watching warily. They fear that pursuit of the Assange case could be used to try to chip away at First Amendment freedoms, especially given the adversarial relationship this Administration has with the media. In a remarkable speech earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts asserted that he was the strongest defender of First Amendment rights on the court. If and when the Assange case begins its journey through the courts, the American media and those who understand how crucial those rights are to our democracy will be watching closely to see if that is so.

Ken Dixon: Things that should vanish: UConn football, poverty and Kate Smith

Texto completo: It seems to me:
That it’s going to be great over the next few weeks when Gov. Ned Lamont finally realizes that to actually get something done, he’s going to have to say “No” to fellow Democrats and find $1.9 billion to balance the budget. Everything else up until then will just be honeymoon good times. Let the hornswoggling begin. That first veto is always such a cleansing experience.
Say what you want about the Mueller Report’s findings, but there’s a lot more to the story of Donald Trump and his cronies that’s bound to come out in the dozen active criminal and civil investigations, not including whatever course of action the scaredy-cats in the U.S. House of Representatives may decide is politically expedient.
One landmark in the report was the president’s use of a term that rhymes with a waterfowl, which made the front page of the New York Times and which Hearst boiled down to “f - - - - ed” as the president described his predicament.
Just at a time when more people are realizing that teens and young-twenty-somethings shouldn’t be prosecuted as adults for stupid things, along comes the knucklehead trio from Stratford and Shelton , accused of burning down the Shakespeare theater, and connected to fires at construction trailers in Silver Sands State Park.
The death of Lorraine Warren , the Monroe ghostbuster, now puts her in the perfect position to seek out and converse with the infamous “White Lady” ghost up there in the Stepney Cemetery on Route 59, where her late husband Ed has been representing since his departure from this mortal coil in the summer of 2006.
That if you think Connecticut is in wonderful shape, you should read the “State of Urban Connecticut,” the tale of two states just published by Quinnipiac University and the Urban League of Southern Connecticut. It seems that economic disparities have never been starker between the suburbs and the urban communities, where housing, jobs and the cost of living are crippling multiple generations.
Sure, the governor is still locating the bathrooms in the Capitol, and he accomplished very little other than some important tone-setting during his first 100 days. But one thing he’s dead right on: the proposal left over from his predecessor to force wealthier towns to cough up 25 percent of their pension costs for their public school teachers, who are paid higher than average.
It’s about time that the New York Yankees finally ditched that scratchy version of Kate Smith singing “God Bless America” every seventh-inning-stretch since the Sept. 11 attacks. The suspension is over Smith’s recording of racist songs that were hits before your mother was born. But it’s the phony nationalism that’s bugged me, with Yankee security guards telling “guests,” not fans, guests, to take off their hats during the late part of the game when crowds should focus on standing, seeing who else is there, and singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.” I’ll doff my Yankee hat for any National Anthem. I’ll sing along and maybe even cry a tear for this poor country of ours. But “God Bless America” is jingoistic overkill.
It’s time for the UConn Board of Trustees to say goodbye to intercollegiate football. I know you’re trying to remember whether there is a team up there, they are so bad. There is. They are, and they cost $15.7 million last season, with $2.4 million in tickets sold. You know what a real research university could do with 16 million smackers? Create some jobs for Ph.Ds, rather than rattling the brains of young men.
If if there’s to be any eventual success for the full legalization of marijuana for use by adults, the General Assembly would be better off this year focusing on the parts of the bill that are achievable, such as the expungement of criminal records for those convicted of simple possession, and a study of ways to define and detect unacceptable levels of THC in intoxicated drivers.
The Stop & Shop strike is still raging and the parking lots are looking pretty empty around these supermarkets. While I don’t like what the strike is doing to employee paychecks, I am kind of proud to always avoid those self check-out registers. And I’m very proud that, during the last few weeks before the strike, I found myself standing next to those tall aisle robots and asking nearby human employees if I should punch the bots. Workers never said no.

Resumen: [...]OK, let's play ball: "Play Hungry: The Making of a Baseball Player," by Pete Rose (Penguin Press) In 23 seasons Pete Rose, aka "Charlie Hustle," established a bunch of records- most hits (4,256), most games played (3,562), most at-bats (14,053), you get the idea. "For the Good of the Game: The Inside Story of the Surprising and Dramatic Transformation of Major League Baseball," by Bud Selig (Morrow) During his 22-year tenure as commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig dealt with a number of challenges, including the 1994 players union strike and the cancellation of that year's World Series. Longtime New York Times reporter Bill Pennington traces the team's resurrection with an insider's baseball expertise, crediting general manager Gene Michael with exemplary talent evaluation, building a farm system that produced the core four of the next decade's success -- shortstop Derek Jeter, pitcher Andy Pettite, catcher Jorge Posada and Hall of Fame reliever Mariano Rivera.

Texto completo: Baseball has inspired some of the best writing about sports. Think "Ball Four," by Jim Bouton, "Moneyball," by Michael Lewis, "The Boys of Summer," by Roger Kahn, or Bernard Malamud's classic novel, "The Natural." This year's crop of baseball books covers a wide swath -- memoir, biography, history and more. We hear from Pete Rose and Yogi Berra's son, from a philosopher and a former MLB commissioner. There's enough here to get you through extra innings. So, OK, let's play ball:

"Play Hungry: The Making of a Baseball Player," by Pete Rose (Penguin Press)

In 23 seasons Pete Rose, aka "Charlie Hustle," established a bunch of records- most hits (4,256), most games played (3,562), most at-bats (14,053), you get the idea. His baseball career ended in 1989 after revelations that he gambled on baseball, a subject he discusses for just two pages in a book billed as the star's "love letter" to the game. This is not Rose's first book since he was permanently banned from baseball and made ineligible for induction at Cooperstown. Here he focuses on stories from baseball's Golden Age and on his dedication to playing the game "the right way."

"K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches," by Tyler Kepner (Doubleday)

Kepner, the national baseball writer for the New York Times, has chosen a nifty conceit. He's organized his history of the game around the 10 major types of pitches - slider, fastball, knuckleball, splitter, screwball, sinker, change-up, cutter, spitball, curveball. He relies on the testimony of hurlers with the most recorded strikeouts to elucidate the complicated and magical art of throwing a ball 60 feet 6 inches. The result is a fascinating tour of the sport as seen from the mound.

"Infinite Baseball: Notes From a Philosopher at the Ballpark," by Alva NoÃ« (Oxford)

This is an original, amusing tome that validates the "small ball" theory of writing -- the smaller the ball, the better the writing. NoÃ«, a baseball-loving philosopher, disagrees with the current preoccupation with numbers and Major League Baseball's obsession with speeding up -- thus shortening -- the game. (There's a full chapter called "In praise of being bored.") In addition to some metaphysical reflections, NoÃ« takes up the more administrative aspects of the sport -- the role of umpires, the strike zone and the value of instant replay.

"Ten Innings at Wrigley: The Wildest Ballgame Ever, With Baseball on the Brink," by Kevin Cook (Henry Holt)

Wrigley Field, despite money-grubbing improvements, rightfully stands with Fenway Park as a revered baseball venue. Among the most memorable games played there was the 1979 slugfest between the Phillies and the "lovable losing" Cubs. Kevin Cook recounts the contest -- indeed a wild game -- that was knotted 22-all in the ninth inning (no spoilers here) before ending with 45 runs scored. It's a vivid tale of a dramatic contest just as the sport was about to enter an era that was more, well, money-grubbing.

"Son of Havana: A Baseball Journey From Cuba to the Big Leagues and Back," by Luis Tiant (Diversion), and "Last Seasons in Havana: The Castro Revolution and the End of Professional Baseball in Cuba," by CÃ©sar Brioso (Nebraska)

Cuba has contributed a long list of beguiling and accomplished players to the Big Leagues, not the least being Luis "El Tiante" Tiant, the ‘70s-era Red Sox pitching ace. "Son of Havana," a lively memoir, recounts his colorful, bittersweet life on the mound and beyond. In "Last Seasons in Havana," journalist CÃ©sar Brioso focuses on the final three seasons of the Cuban League (1958-59 to 1960-61) and the last two seasons of the Havana Sugar Kings, a MLB AAA affiliate (1959 and 1960).

"For the Good of the Game: The Inside Story of the Surprising and Dramatic Transformation of Major League Baseball," by Bud Selig (Morrow)

During his 22-year tenure as commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig dealt with a number of challenges, including the 1994 players union strike and the cancellation of that year's World Series. During his time as commissioner, interleague play was implemented and instant replay was introduced. Selig is credited with increases in revenue and attendance, but the steroid scandal remains uppermost in his mind. Part memoir, part business book, part apologia, Selig's testimony is a necessary addition to baseball history.

"Here's the Pitch: The Amazing, True, New, and Improved Story of Baseball and Advertising," by Roberta J. Newman (Nebraska)

Understanding baseball, the country's oldest sport, is for some observers -- see Jacques Barzun -- essential for grasping American culture. Newman, a cultural historian, charts the synergy, beginning in the mid-19th century, between the nascent pastime and the neophyte advertising industry, offering a savvy critique of the connection.

"My Dad, Yogi: A Memoir of Family and Baseball," by Dale Berra (Hachette)

Today, New York Yankee Hall of Famer Yogi Berra may be remembered more for his contributions to language than to sport. Here his son Dale, who had a 10-year MLB stint, reports on his father from a singularly intimate perspective. The younger Berra also talks about the drug problem that cut short his own career and how Yogi's response saved his life. Dale Berra's memoir both illuminates baseball history and adds to Yogi's life story.

"Chumps to Champs: How the Worst Teams in Yankees History Led to the ‘90s Dynasty," by Bill Pennington (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)

The title tells the story: The New York Yankees were shrouded in a "cloak of doom" from 1989 to 1992. Longtime New York Times reporter Bill Pennington traces the team's resurrection with an insider's baseball expertise, crediting general manager Gene Michael with exemplary talent evaluation, building a farm system that produced the core four of the next decade's success -- shortstop Derek Jeter, pitcher Andy Pettite, catcher Jorge Posada and Hall of Fame reliever Mariano Rivera.

"Let's Play Two: The Legend of Mr. Cub, the Life of Ernie Banks," by Ron Rapoport (Hachette), and "Let's Play Two: The Life and Times of Ernie Banks," by Doug Wilson (Rowman & Littlefield)

Ernie Banks' trademark phrase serves as the title of two new biographies of the 14-time all-star who spent 19 seasons with the Cubs. Banks' story -- rising from mean beginnings in the Jim Crow South to glory -- is well told by Chicago sportswriter Ron Rapoport. His is an extensively researched portrayal of the public figure as well as the lesser-known, private Banks. Wilson, an experienced baseball biographer, located several friends from Banks' childhood and high school years, as well as some Kansas City Monarchs with whom he played in the Negro Leagues. Choosing one bio over the other is a toss-up, so "let's read two."

"108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters From My Time in the Game," by Ron Darling (St. Martin's)

Former big league starter Darling makes use of his Ivy League smarts to serve up a full menu of baseball lore harvested from a wide swath of characters - people from his playing career, Hall of Famers, MLB commissioners and more. Darling's book is a rich presentation of the allure of the game and its culture as well as a showcase of his own charisma.

Appeal for donor illustrates shortage

Texto completo: It's a conveyance of our time; a poignant message scrawled across the rear windshield of a car or truck, often as a memorial for a lost friend or relative, a kind of rolling obituary.
This one, on the window of a Volkswagen, suggested something more urgent. But just as poignant. "In need of a kidney. 305-857-5999. Blood type O+"
And there you have it. American healthcare, circa 2019.
To be fair, there's a worldwide shortage of organ donors. Except in the U.S., recipients lucky enough to be picked for one of those scarce organs can also face overwhelming hospital, doctor and drug costs.
"I loved being here for all these years, living my American dream, while I was in good health," said Mathieu Seydewitz, the VW owner in dire need of a functioning kidney. "But now it's a tough deal. There's no safety net. There's not much help for a situation like mine."
Mathieu, who lives in Fort Lauderdale and has a three-year-old daughter, has added his name to the organ waiting list, but the math is daunting.
About 118,000 American men, women and children (as of January) are hoping they'll be chosen for a lifesaving organ, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services. Every 10 minutes, another wretched hopeful adds his name to the registry.
Juxtapose those 118,000 Americans with failing organs against the 36,528 transplants performed in 2018 (82 percent involved kidneys). No wonder 20 people in need of a transplant die every day.
Ten years ago, an illness initially misdiagnosed as a sinus infection turned out to be Wegener granulomatosis, an autoimmune disease that attacks blood vessels and threatens vital organs. Mathieu was left with ever worsening kidney damage.
Among other symptoms, he suffers acute anemia and fading strength and endurance. No small thing for someone who made his living as a country club tennis pro and instructor.
Seydewitz, 40, a native of Paris, came to the U.S. two decades ago to play tennis for Tulane University and transferred to join the nationally ranked team at Mississippi State University. He earned a degree in international business, but his career since graduation has been based on his athleticism. Lately, this athlete is down to 145 pounds and suffers perpetual exhaustion. So much for his career as a tennis pro. (Seydewitz, who speaks six languages, has managed to stave off utter poverty as a freelance online translator.) Bills have been mounting fast. So far, he has been able to avoid dialysis but that's not for long.
Here's what sick Americans do. His friend Patti Blankenship launched a social media campaign to raise money for his medical bills and to seek a kidney donor who'll allow him to bypass the waiting list. Her idea is that if enough people see his story, some kind soul will offer up a kidney.
It's a long shot but maybe his best chance in America, where the organ transplant regime is plainly rigged to favor the wealthy.
The New York Times reported in December that U.S. transplant centers winnow out transplant candidates who can't demonstrate they can cover the cost of the operation. (About $400,000 for a kidney. Seydewitz thinks he'd need between $35,000 to $55,000 beyond what his medical insurance would cover.) Plus, recipients often face the costs of a lifelong regime anti-rejection drugs, some of which aren't covered by insurance or Medicare and can cost thousands a month. Pick a recipient without financial resources, the theory goes, and a precious organ could be wasted.
Most donated organs are derived from recently deceased donors. In 2018, among the 17,553 U.S. donors, 10,722 were deceased. Most had opted into the organ donation system (often by checking a box on their driver's license application). But donor programs are hampered by a peculiar phenomenon. While about 95 percent of Americans say they're willing donors, only 58 percent actually opt-in. (Only .03 percent of those potential donors die in a way that allows organ preservation.)
A number of European nations are changing to an "opt-out" system, creating the legal presumption that a deceased person had been a willing donor unless they had formally declared otherwise. But that's a controversial notion in the U.S. Maybe we could try the Israel way, which confers priority on transplant lists to those whose deceased family members were organ donors. Either system would probably save more lives than the American system.
It's such a complicated dilemma. But one man has condensed those wretched complexities to seven words and a telephone number across the rear window of a VW.

Texto completo: The City of East Lansing and Michigan State University have announced the book selection for the 2019 One Book, One Community (OBOC) program: "Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City" by author Matthew Desmond.
Desmond's Pulitzer Prize-winning book transports readers to the poorest neighborhoods in Milwaukee to tell the heartbreaking, real-life stories of eight families struggling to keep a roof over their heads. By living among these families in 2008 and 2009, Desmond is able to provide readers with a ground-level view of one of 21st-century America's most devastating problems and shine a probing light on the human cost of America's immense inequality.
Desmond's book has garnered countless accolades, including being the winner of: the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction and the Andrew Carnegie Medal Excellence in Nonfiction. The book was also a New York Times bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times Book Review, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, NPR, Entertainment Weekly, The New Yorker and many more.
Desmond is a professor of sociology at Princeton University and is the recipient of a MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship, the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the William Julius Wilson Early Career Award. As the principal investigator at The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, Desmond's research has focused on poverty in America, city life, housing insecurity, public policy, racial inequality and ethnography.
Desmond's book, "Evicted," was picked by the East Lansing-MSU community via an online survey that was conducted in early 2019. The survey invited community participants to select one of three books on the OBOC Selection Committee's short list for the 2019 program, with Desmond's "Evicted" garnering the most votes. More information on the book can be found at evictedbook.com/.
About OBOC Signature Events
As part of the 2019 OBOC program, Desmond will visit the East Lansing-MSU community in August 2019. Community members are invited to A Community Conversation with Matthew Desmond on Sunday, Aug. 25 at 6:30 p.m. at the East Lansing Hannah Community Center, 819 Abbot Road.

Texto completo: Modell's Sporting Goods, known for its catchy "Gotta Go To Mo's" jingle, has obtained guidance from a financial adviser — an indication that the country's oldest sporting goods store is facing mounting pressure in today's competitive retail climate.The Manhattan-based retailer, which has more than 150 stores in the Northeast, including dozens in New York and New Jersey, has tapped California-based consulting firm Berkeley Research Group, the same adviser that worked with Modell's in 2017 and that has advised other troubled retailers like Gymboree Group Inc.Retail experts say it is not unusual for retailers to reposition themselves in the ever-changing world of retail, where competition from big-box stores and online shopping has forced a growing list of retailers to file for bankruptcy in the first four months of 2019 alone, including Charlotte Russe and Payless ShoeSource.Mitchell Modell, the retailer's chief executive, said the retailer has long-term plans to stay in business."We are committed to securing our future in a challenging retail climate, and therefore are always looking for ways to improve our performance," Modell said in an emailed statement responding to questions from the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "To help us with efficiencies and process improvement, we have engaged Berkeley Research Group, as we have done in the past."
Modell, a resident of Alpine, did not specify what the company's plans were. When asked if stores would be closing in New Jersey or New York, he said the retailer had no plans to shutter stores in those markets, beyond closures that he said occur annually when leases expire.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in March that Modell's hired Berkeley Research Group. In the report, people familiar with the matter said options on the table included a possible bankruptcy filing or restructuring.
Should the retailer eventually file for bankruptcy or plan widespread closures, it could send shock waves across New York and New Jersey's retail sectors. The chain has an estimated 100 stores in the two states, according to the company's website. That's about one-third of the chain's retail footprint.
Widespread closures could have a big impact on the region's commercial real estate market, which has recently had to absorb the closure of Toys R Us and Sears stores, and must deal with planned closures of some Bed Bath & Beyond stores soon.
Retailers typically hire financial advisers when the future of their companies is uncertain, and because advisers can offer an objective approach to dealing with a distressed company, said Ted Gavin, managing director of Gavin/Solmonese, a bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm.
Modell's likely hired an adviser "because they have a fundamental business problem that is threatening the future of the company, and that is in all likelihood a combination of too little revenue and burdensome leases," Gavin said.
Gavin, who has more than 20 years of experience working with distressed companies, said Modell's may consider getting out of under-performing markets. That, he said, is key to balancing other financial strains a retailer may be facing, whether too much debt or declining sales in particular stores.
"The key is to get out of the markets that aren't working for you and to do it early enough to be able to preserve cash," Gavin said. "Moving to online may supplement what you lose in closing retail — but the important thing is to get out of money-losing retail locations."
The retail world has been unforgiving to sporting goods companies, but Modell's, the oldest family-owned sporting goods company in the country, has managed to stay afloat amid the changing tides.
The business started when Morris A. Modell, an immigrant from Hungary, opened a general store on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan in 1889 — a date that has been affixed on the store's red-and-white signs for decades. The company thrived after World War I by stocking up on Army surplus merchandise and selling it at low prices, according to William Modell's obituary in The New York Times.
William Modell, the third generation to run the business, profited from the failures of his rivals, the Times reported. In 1996, Modell's grew from 67 stores by paying $2.5 million for 15 outlets in New Jersey and in the Baltimore and Washington areas from bankrupt Herman's World of Sporting Goods.
Modell's reportedly considered a similar strategy in 2016 when Sports Authority liquidated all its stores. Modell's planned to bid on some of Sports Authority's failed stores, but that plan was never executed.
Often, the competition between sporting goods companies has been fierce. Dick's Sporting Goods, arguably, fast-tracked Sports Authority's demise — the big-box chain had a strategy of placing its new stores as close as possible to existing Sports Authority locations, taking away sales from the struggling retailer.
Today, Dick's Sporting Goods remains a dominant player. Founded in 1948, the company has ballooned and now operates 729 stores. But even the successful chain experienced softening sales, and has plans to up its in-store and online game in 2019, officials said in the company's latest earnings release.
Modell's, by comparison, has a much smaller footprint that is exclusive to the Northeast.
The chain has more than 30 stores in New Jersey, and nearly 70 locations across New York, with most concentrated in New York City. Modell's also has dozens of stores scattered throughout Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia.
The chain has concentrated its retail footprint largely in urban areas, in or near cities like Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Boston.
The retailer's strategy to concentrate on a specific market, experts say, is what may have kept it afloat while other sporting goods chains fell by the wayside.
"They've always been a wise retailer," said Chuck Lanyard, president of retail brokerage firm The Goldstein Group in Paramus. "Over 20 years ago, they began to focus on a lot of inner-city sporting supplies, because they really met the niche for that urban, inner-city sporting good store."
For instance, the chain has a prominent location inside Center City Mall in Paterson. Alma Realty, which owns the property, declined to comment about the store's lease.
Shutting some stores, especially in weak markets where sales may be lagging, is typical for a retailer, Lanyard said. Often, a retailer may shut stores in under-performing markets to concentrate on profitable locations or on other ways to make money, he said.

Texto completo: Dance: Spring at New York City Ballet
April 23-June 2; nycballet.com
If you were looking forward to an immediate fix of George Balanchine, you're out of luck: The company opens its spring season with works by contemporary choreographers. But there are some gems, including Justin Peck's dashing "Rodeo: Four Dance Episodes," William Forsythe's handsome two-part "Herman Schmerman" and Alexei Ratmansky's soulful "Pictures at an Exhibition," which features stunning costumes by Adeline André and projections of Wassily Kandinsky's watercolors.
In May, expect a set of premieres by Peck, City Ballet's resident choreographer and artistic adviser, and the contemporary choreographer Pam Tanowitz. A ballet for 10 set to Bela Bartok's String Quartet No. 5, it marks Tanowitz's first work for this company. It's fitting that one of Tanowitz's heroes, Jerome Robbins, will be celebrated this season, notably with the anniversary performances of "Dances at a Gathering," his 1969 masterpiece. And there's plenty of Balanchine, too: The last week is devoted to "A Midsummer Night's Dream." It's spectacular. GIA KOURLAS

TV: Meet 'Gentleman Jack,' a Modern Woman
April 22; hbo.com
Anne Lister walks like a man -- assertive strides in waistcoat and top hat, with all the panache of a swashbuckler.
She talks like one, too, whether collecting rent from tenants on her British estate or seducing the ladies.
"Nature played a challenging trick on me, didn't she, putting a bold spirit like mine in this vessel, in which I'm obliged to wear frills and petticoats?," Lister, broadly considered to be the first modern lesbian, confides. "Well, I refuse to be cowed by it."
In "Gentleman Jack," the new HBO-BBC historical drama from Sally Wainwright ("Happy Valley"), Lister (Suranne Jones) cuts a wide swath through 1832 Halifax, West Yorkshire, where she's determined to rejuvenate her shabby ancestral home, Shibden Hall, reopen its coal mines and marry well; her eye is on the neighboring heiress, Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle).
The series, debuting on Monday, April 22, on HBO and its platforms, is inspired by Lister's diaries, comprising some four million words -- with the most intimate details of her romantic liaisons written in a secret code based on algebraic symbols and Ancient Greek, and deciphered in the 1930s.

Theater: 'Tootsie' Morphs Into a Broadway Musical
Opens April 23; tootsiemusical.com .
In the race for Broadway accolades, this is crunch week, when the last productions of the season open just in time to meet the cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility -- ensuring, in the process, that they'll be extra fresh in Tony voters' minds. Timing is crucial.
One of those shows, now in previews for an opening on Tuesday, April 23, at the Marquis Theater, is "Tootsie," a musical comedy remake of Sydney Pollack's hit movie from 1982, which starred Dustin Hoffman as an arrogant, unemployed actor who masquerades as a woman to land a part.
The dependably delightful Santino Fontana ("Crazy Ex-Girlfriend") leads the cast of the stage adaptation, which has a score by David Yazbek ("The Band's Visit") and a book by Robert Horn ("13"). Directed by Scott Ellis ("Kiss Me, Kate"), it got largely enthusiastic reviews in Chicago last fall, though some sensed a cringe factor in a plot about a self-centered man feigning femaleness to nab a woman's role. Will that register on Broadway? It should be interesting to see. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Pop Music: Bad Bunny at Madison Square Garden
April 27; ticketmaster.com
Two years after the summer of "Despacito," and two decades after the Latin pop wave led by Ricky Martin, it's clear that the prevalence of Latin music in the United States is far from a passing trend. Among the Top 40's most essential personalities is Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican rapper whose music fuses elements of trap and reggaeton, and whose voice graced some of 2018's biggest hits, including Cardi B's "I Like It" and his Drake collaboration, "Mia."
Bad Bunny's success speaks to the globalization of American music, but also to a rap narrative that's grown familiar in this age of virality: Just three years ago, he was bagging groceries and casually posting tracks to SoundCloud. His solo debut, "X 100PRE" dropped last year on Christmas Eve, and already the 25-year-old has nearly completed his second headlining arena tour in the United States. His Saturday show at Madison Square Garden marks the final date of this leg. OLIVIA HORN
Art: Don't Smack the Canvas
Through May 12; karmakarma.org
The painted tambourines that the artist Paul Lee incorporates into the shaped-canvas abstractions of his latest show, "I see with my body now," at Karma Gallery, function as visual punctuation. In the bottom corner of a large black square, a round white tambourine is a full stop, telling your eye that the picture is over and its maker has nothing more to say. In red or yellow pairs, at opposite corners of simple, two-tone designs, the instruments are both quotation marks and parentheses, emphasizing the intentional, communicative nature of any art work, even the most opaque, while also insisting on its provisionality: The pieces can express only what viewer and artist, for a passing moment, agree on. WILL HEINRICH
Classical Music: Back to the Analyst's Couch
April 25--27; mastervoices.org
When "Lady in the Dark," an all-star collaboration of the composer Kurt Weill, the lyricist Ira Gershwin and the playwright Moss Hart, first debuted on Broadway in 1941, it was heralded by The New York Times as "the finest score written for the theater in years" and ran for several hundred performances. Built on a somewhat-dated midcentury conceit, the musical tells the story of an editor for the fashion magazine "Allure" and her forays into psychoanalysis, which unfold in a series of dream episodes led by Weill's characteristically cutting music. It's been a quarter-century since the musical was last heard in New York, but it will return in a welcome revival this week by the group MasterVoices at New York City Center. This new concert staging stars the Tony winner Victoria Clark, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's in the pit, new choreography by Doug Varone, and glamorously surreal costumes provided by a team of designers.

Film: At Last, Alice Guy-Blaché Gets Her Due in 'Be Natural'
April 19 and 26
She witnessed the birth of cinema with the Lumière brothers in Paris in 1895 then directed one of the world's first narrative films, "The Cabbage Fairy," the next year; made her own movies that took on immigration, labor conflicts and anti-Semitism; wrote a screenplay about Planned Parenthood; and assembled the first all-black film cast.
So why have most of us never heard about the first female filmmaker? That's what "Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché" wants to know.
Hired in 1896, at 22, as a secretary to the motion-picture pioneer Léon Gaumont, Guy-Blaché went on -- with the encouragement of her boss, who thought cinema was a young woman's adventure, as long as the mail didn't suffer -- to make some 1,000 shorts and features. Eventually moving to the United States, she founded the Solax studio, where her mandate to actors was, "Be natural."
But in 1922, Guy-Blaché divorced and returned to France, where she sank into obscurity -- her accomplishments often credited to men or erased entirely in historical accounts of the industry she helped to create.
Directed by Pamela B. Green and narrated by Jodie Foster, also an executive producer, "Be Natural" opens in Los Angeles on Friday, April 19, and New York on April 26, before a national rollout. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Texto completo: BEHIND THE BYLINE
Jose Del Real on the Emotional Weight and 'Thematic Whiplash' of Covering California
Interview by Lara Takenaga
______
The Reader Center has started a new series of short interviews, Behind the Byline , to introduce you to Times journalists. Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.
Leer en español
When Jose Del Real joined the ranks of The Times's California correspondents last year, the job was a homecoming of sorts for him. Born in the Central Valley to Mexican immigrants, Jose and his family left the state when he was a baby and moved to Alaska. He then went east for college and became a political reporter in Washington.
Based in Los Angeles now, he zigzags across California covering some of today's most significant domestic stories, as varied as wildfires, shootings and the opioid crisis.

What do you enjoy most about being a National correspondent? What is most challenging about it?
Sometimes there are these moments of vulnerability and honesty that happen in reporting, when the people I'm interviewing feel comfortable enough to open up about their lives. That is always an amazing gift and comes with a lot of responsibility. Those conversations make my work feel like a vocation. My job is about truth and, at the highest level, empathy. Everyone has a story that matters; some people are just never asked to share it.
This job can be tough, though. As correspondents, our weeks and months can be unpredictable because we have to balance longer-term projects with breaking news. One week in November, to give an extreme example, my fellow California reporters and I went from covering the midterms on Tuesday, to a horrific shooting on Wednesday night, to wildfires on Thursday. There's thematic whiplash, and it's emotionally heavy. Our editors provide crucial support while we're in the thick of it.
And balancing work with my personal life can feel surreal at times. One Saturday during the wildfires, my partner, Patrick, found an open afternoon to propose after scouting a good day for weeks. By Monday I was on the southern border for a story.
Do you ever feel emotionally overwhelmed when you're reporting on tragedies? If so, how do you overcome that?
On assignment, the part of my brain that can feel overwhelmed turns off. It must be adrenaline.
On the ground, I've spoken to people minutes after they've seen their friends killed, or hours after their homes have burned down. I've spent a lot of time with people fighting addiction. Journalists have a responsibility to approach these situations with humility and humanity; that's my priority, so there's little room to dwell on my anxieties.
Once I'm home or in my hotel room, that's another thing. Journalists don't talk enough about the effect that stress and adrenaline can have on our bodies, let alone on our mental health. I'm lucky to have a partner, family and friends who sustain me emotionally. I also have an informal support group at The Times, journalists with whom I check in regularly and vice versa. But I'd like for this to become a bigger conversation in newsrooms.
How do you spend your time when you're off duty?
Off duty? El-Oh-El.
I'm on the road a lot for work and persistently on call for breaking news. It's exhilarating but a double-edged sword. I never imagined I'd see so much of this country. But being away from home so often, in many cases with little notice, can be tough.
"Self-care" has become a hokey phrase, but I do believe in finding healthy ways to relieve stress. Some people I know practice meditation, but that hasn't worked for me. I subscribe to the "Just Dance" model of self-care. I try to start my days, at least when I'm on the road, with five-minute dance parties. Yes, by myself. Try it! They are extraordinarily rejuvenating. If you're in a bad mood afterward, there's nothing else I can do for you. The trick is making space for some joy and whimsy. That and a steady dose of exercise, novels and "Grey's Anatomy" keep me sane.
I also try to be mindful of how my work affects my partner. He has been inoculated against my schedule (we started dating while I was covering the Trump campaign). But just because he's exceptionally supportive doesn't mean I'm not responsible for him in return. When I'm home, we cook together, drink wine and listen to Linda Ronstadt, hike or visit art galleries. The biggest check on my "screen time" is my desire to maximize my time with him, friends and family, because I have no idea when I might need to bail. Ten minutes on Twitter are 10 wasted minutes.
How has your background, as a gay man and the son of Mexican immigrants, informed your work?
I'm always a little bit of an outsider wherever I am. I grew up in a trailer park in Anchorage. My parents don't speak English and hustled hard to get by in the United States. They picked fruit when I was a baby in California. My dad fixed cars and washed dishes at restaurants. My mom cleaned rooms at a hotel for nearly two decades. I worked at that same hotel in high school.
But that feels like a lifetime away now. I went to Harvard on scholarship. I work at The New York Times. My partner is a university professor. Reconciling my life then with my life now can be challenging but enlightening.
I feel a responsibility to reflect a range of voices and communities in the articles I write. It's not about a "Woke Checklist" -- it's about truth, about reflecting the world as it is and acknowledging our blind spots. That is why I'm so passionate about increasing diversity in newsrooms and making entry-level journalism jobs (and internships) financially realistic. I wasn't always so comfortable sharing this stuff about my life, but I want journalists of color and from low-income backgrounds to know this career track is for them, too.
If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?
In college, I thought I might want to become an academic. During my sophomore year I fell in love with social theory. Reading Michel Foucault felt like having the veil lifted from my eyes. His ideas about power, systems and "regimes of truth" are extremely relevant today.
I've also always had a profound affinity for archives. I sometimes wonder what I'd be up to if I were a historian. As a journalist, though, I get to work on the living, daily version of history. It's such a gift.

Texto completo: Backstage at the Metropolitan Opera, a rehearsal pianist was ready to launch into Wagner's famous "Ride of the Valkyries." But before the battalion of singers could unleash their war cries -- "Hojotoho!" -- the conductor, Philippe Jordan, paused to offer a brief elocution lesson.
"Hoy-yo-TOE-hoe," Mr. Jordan said, emphasizing the crisp "T," which can easily get lost amid all those high-decibel vowels. "TOE-hoe."
He gave a nod; the pianist thundered into the familiar, galloping rhythms; and the eight Valkyries began to sing -- powerfully enough to shake the floorboards of the small rehearsal hall.
"Yes!" Mr. Jordan cried approvingly, having nailed down one of the myriad details needed to bring Wagner's epic "Ring" to life. "I heard the 'T'! One more time."
Conducting the four operas of the "Ring" -- about 15 hours of music -- is a test of endurance and artistry unlike any in opera. For the revival of Robert Lepage's production this year, which continues through May 11, the Met has entrusted the task to Mr. Jordan, 44. Relatively little known in the United States, he stands at the crossroads of a major career in Europe: Having spent nearly a decade leading one of the world's most storied opera companies, the Opéra National de Paris, he is now preparing to become music director of the grand Vienna State Opera in 2020.
[Read about the breakout star of the Met's "Ring."]
[Take a look at the Met's daring Brünnhilde.]
But he is spending this spring rehearsing and performing the "Ring" in New York. Despite the relentless pace, he said, it felt almost like an idyll.
"It's good for three months to just focus on music," Mr. Jordan said as he ate lunch between an orchestra rehearsal of "Siegfried" onstage and a piano rehearsal of "Götterdämmerung" in the Met's basement. "To just think about Wagner, and not the next audition, or planning meeting, or union meeting."
Mr. Jordan is something of a rarity: a second-generation Wagner conductor. His father, Armin Jordan, conducted a number of acclaimed Wagner performances around the world, as well as the soundtrack of Hans-Jürgen Syberberg's beguiling, experimental 1982 film of "Parsifal." Illness curtailed the elder Mr. Jordan's plans to conduct the "Ring" in Seattle at the beginning of this century, and forced him to cancel a planned Met debut; he died in 2006.
Now his son is emerging as a major Wagnerian, leading acclaimed performances of the master's works in Paris; at Bayreuth, the festival Wagner founded in Germany; and now at the Met, where his propulsive but intense "Ring" is earning strong reviews. Before he leaves his position in Paris, Mr. Jordan will conduct a new production of the "Ring" next year, staged by Calixto Bieito.
It was not always a given that this would be a podium dynasty. Mr. Jordan said that his father had initially been skeptical of his desire to conduct. "He didn't really believe in that," Mr. Jordan recalled. "So I had to prove it."
He learned the craft the old-fashioned way: as a musical jack-of-all-trades at a small but busy German opera house, the theater in Ulm. "It was very bizarre: I started conducting, and my father was watching a little bit, and he became very supportive," Mr. Jordan said. "All the doubts he had before turned around the other way. I got all the doubts; he was more encouraging."
He got a grounding not only in opera but also in operettas and musicals; his first piece was "Funny Girl," and he said he did "West Side Story" dozens of times. It was the approach favored by his father, who wanted him to learn the practical aspects of conducting by doing it, rather than going the route of conservatories, competitions and sporadic concerts. After several seasons in Ulm, Mr. Jordan became an assistant under Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin State Opera.
"The orchestra is the best teacher," Mr. Jordan said. "You get an immediate response if it works or if it doesn't work."
At the Met, shortly after his Valkyrie diction lesson, he found himself leading a rehearsal of "Siegfried" one morning without his baritone -- so he gamely sang some of the lines himself. This kind of multitasking is key to the "Ring." After spending another morning fine-tuning orchestral passages in "Siegfried" -- "Chamber music now!" "More leggiero; lighter!" "Now, really fortissimo!" -- he went to his dressing room to switch scores, which were piled in a tall stack in his locker above his shiny patent-leather shoes and below his white tie and tails. Then he spent the afternoon working with the honey-voiced heldentenor Andreas Schager on his death scene in "Götterdämmerung."
Mr. Jordan's approach to Wagner has evolved. "Every young conductor takes Wagner slow at the beginning, to enjoy the sounds and everything," he said. "But it should go at the speed of the text."
He said he had also come to realize that many Wagner works are played more loudly and heavily than the composer intended; he cited the opening of "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg," which he conducted in Bayreuth, as a prime example.
"It's not a statement, it's certainly not a nationalist statement," Mr. Jordan said. "It's an invitation for a comedy: Come in, it's about art, it's about joy, it's about counterpoint, it's about singing."
For decades at the Met, the "Ring" was the province of James Levine, its longtime music director. But in 2011, midway through the introduction of Mr. Lepage's much-debated production, Mr. Levine was sidelined by a spinal injury and replaced by Fabio Luisi. The Met's post-Levine "Ring" era had begun. Mr. Jordan was cast for this revival even before the Met fired Mr. Levine last year amid allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, which he has denied.
Mr. Jordan's reviews have been positive. When the run began with "Das Rheingold" last month, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that he "led a refreshingly lithe and transparent account of 'Rheingold,' keeping things fleet and colorful during playful stretches, but drawing out dark, heaving undercurrents when the music turned ominous."
Now the eyes of the opera world are on Mr. Jordan as he prepares to assume the musical leadership of the Vienna State Opera, led in the past by Mahler, Richard Strauss and Herbert von Karajan. He was hired there by Bogdan Roscic, who will become the company's next director in 2020, and who said he had been impressed by Mr. Jordan's success in lifting the musical quality in Paris.
"I just caught myself going more and more to Paris," said Mr. Roscic, who is currently the president of Sony Music Masterworks. "Whereas 15 years ago -- I don't want to say it wasn't on the map, that would be arrogant, but it just did not have the same relevance."
Mr. Roscic described Mr. Jordan as a conductor who "transcends national schools or specialties." In Paris, he has led Berlioz operas and a starry new production of Verdi's "Don Carlos" in the original French; and with the Vienna Symphony, where he has been music director since 2014, he conducted a Beethoven cycle, performed Tchaikovsky and reclaimed Bach from the world of historically informed performance.
Mr. Roscic offered a few hints about their plans in Vienna, including a focus on Wagner and Richard Strauss. "But Philippe will also conduct Italian opera of the 19th century; he will conduct 20th-century masterpieces," he said. "He will conduct Mozart -- which we have sworn will be a special focus of our work there."
Mr. Jordan plans to step down from the Vienna Symphony to devote himself to the opera -- and, in a rare move in an age of jet-setting maestros, he does not plan to take a post at another orchestra, at least in the beginning. The Vienna State Opera has not had a music director since 2014, when Franz Welser-Möst abruptly resigned.
"I think the house needs more presence of a music director," Mr. Jordan said, adding that he plans to conduct 30 to 40 performances a season, including two or three new productions.
But all that is more than a year off. Right now he is focused on "Götterdämmerung" -- the last installment of the "Ring," which will open on April 27 -- then on doing two cycles of the "Ring" operas, each within the course of a week, as Wagner intended.
Christine Goerke, the soprano singing Brünnhilde, recalled that when she and a colleague began discussing free will and their characters' motivations at one rehearsal, Mr. Jordan eagerly joined in.
"He put all his stuff down and came onto the set and sat down with us," she said. "He was really excited about it. I thought, this is going to be good."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Texto completo: In the 1980s, New York City sent photographers to every building and every lot in every borough. The city had done the same thing in the 1930s as part of a program to make tax assessments fairer and more accurate.
This time around, the idea was to include newer buildings like Lever House, built in 1952. Critics -- and crowds -- loved the glass and stainless-steel landmark. "People acted as if this was the eighth wonder of the world," the social commentator Lewis Mumford said.
The original World Trade Center, completed in the 1970s, was also new to the tax photographs. The shorter building beneath them was the first hotel opened in Lower Manhattan since 1836. The twin towers and the hotel were destroyed in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001.
As in the 1930s, the photographers carried 35-millimeter cameras, but this time they used color film.
Each photograph showed not only a building, but also the block and lot number from municipal records. To display them, the photographers used a device that attached to the camera.
That was an improvement over the 1930s, when the photographers put sign boards containing the block and lot numbers in the foreground of each photograph.
The reaction as the photographers made their rounds was not the same as in the 1930s. "People had a different attitude about somebody pointing a camera on the street, especially a government worker," said Michael Lorenzini, a city archivist. He said the photographers "worried when they were going out to some of the worst neighborhoods, where you had drug dealers." One camera was stolen during a mugging, and another was taken from the trunk of a photographer's car.
The photographs captured the city as it was: gritty and graffiti-covered in some places, filthy in others. After its brush with bankruptcy in the 1970s, the city had given way to urban decline, which continued amid a crack cocaine epidemic and soaring homicide rates.
We went back out to look at how the city has changed since the 1980s. The SoHo restaurant El Internacional, later known as El Teddy's, was a fixture in the opening montage of "Saturday Night Live" for years, look-alike Statue of Liberty crown and all. El Teddy's became an unofficial landmark of downtown hipness, but in 2001, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission decided not to make it a real landmark. Daniel Buduen, the manager of the hardware store in the building that later replaced it, still gets questions about El Teddy's. "Everyone's looking for the Statue of Liberty crown," he said. Nowhere was the city's long descent toward dereliction more apparent than at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, down the block from one porn palace after another. In 1981, Rolling Stone called it the "sleaziest block in America." The Times Square area became a tourist destination after it was remade in the 1990s. Skyscrapers replaced old, low-rise buildings and tenants including big-name law firms moved in. Next to the new food court at 42nd and Eighth, a movie theater shows first-run films, not porn. Yankee Stadium -- where Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson became legends -- had been known as "the house that Ruth built" for generations. Before it opened in 1923, Babe Ruth had declared, "I'd give a year of my life if I can hit a home run in the first game in this new park." Sure enough, he blasted one in the third inning. Fans kissed the walls as they left after the final game of the 2008 season and the Yankees prepared to move to a new $1.6 billion Yankee Stadium next door. It took six months to demolish the old stadium; the site became a 10-acre park known as Heritage Field. Coney Island was "the apotheosis of the ridiculous," a magazine reporter once wrote -- a gloriously garish playground where buildings were disguised as wriggling fish and sailing ships. Gregory and Paul's, a fast-food restaurant on the boardwalk, was topped by a rocket. Astroland, the amusement park the rocket pointed the way to, is gone. The rocket itself is now an attraction at the theme park that took its place. At the restaurant, Gregory retired in 2009, and it was renamed for Paul's daughter, Tina Georgoulakos. She now presides over the beer bar, the lobster rolls and the cotton candy. Alexander's was a no-frills department store chain that, like Bloomingdale's and Macy's, ran into trouble in the 1980s. Bloomingdale's and Macy's filed for bankruptcy; Alexander's made a profit only when it sold off real estate. It closed the Manhattan store (and the 11 others in the chain) in 1992. The developer Vornado bought Alexander's for the company's real estate and demolished the store. A 55-story tower took its place, home to Bloomberg L.P., former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's media company, and to more than 100 condominium apartments, a Home Depot store and the upscale restaurant Le Cirque (which closed at the end of 2017). In the South Bronx, the Royal Furniture Company warehouse, built in the 1920s, doubled as a retail outlet on weekends. "I sold pots and pans and bake-and-serve sets," recalled David Landes, 53, whose father and grandfather ran the company. "We sold them for $9.99 as a loss leader to get people to come in, and they'd walk out with a couch." The building is now a homeless shelter. Royal Furniture went out of business in the 1990s. The building changed hands several times before the gray paint was removed and remodeling crews went to work inside. But there is still a billboard on the roof.

Journalists regret not taking Romney seriously on Russia

Texto completo: Many reporters who failed to take 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the greatest geopolitical threat to the U.S. are now admitting that they were wrong one day after the Mueller report was released.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who was characterized in one of the emails released by WikiLeaks as friendly to the Clinton campaign in 2016, acknowledged her regret on Friday via Twitter.

"Romney described Russia as the greatest US geopolitical foe in his 2012 presidential campaign, and was broadly mocked. I was among reporters who should have given it more weight," she tweeted.

Ronan Farrow, an investigative reporter with The New Yorker and a former aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, retweeted Haberman, admitting that he did not acknowledge Romney's foresight on Russia and the intent the Russian government had on harming the U.S. through strategic cyberinfluence.

"I’ll join this mea culpa. I aired interviews with Romney where I completely failed to grasp how prescient he was being about Russia," he tweeted.

Romney became one of the first GOP lawmakers to criticize Trump in the wake of Mueller's report, saying Friday he was sickened and appalled by the behavior of Trump and those in his campaign, particularly how those working for the campaign welcomed help from Russia.

Other prominent Democrats and left-leaning figures have also recently acknowledged, and even apologized for, their hits at Romney over Russia. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, for example, apologized to Romney at a congressional hearing earlier this year, adding that Romney's analysis on Russia's impact on the U.S. was correct.

"I personally owe an apology to now-Sen. Romney, because I think that we underestimated what was going on in Russia," Albright said. "I was on the CIA external advisory board, there was no question that less money was being put into Russian language and what was going on in Russia."

The comments on Romney refer to a foreign policy discussion between the Republican candidate and President Barack Obama in the first presidential debate in 2012. When asked during the campaign which nation he considered the biggest geopolitical threat to the United States, the Republican nominee handed the honor to Russia. His Democratic rival, Obama, sneered at the judgment in a presidential debate. "The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back," he said. "The Cold War's been over for 20 years."

While the Mueller report released on Thursday showed that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russians, Mueller's investigation made it absolutely clear that Russia did try to manipulate the result of the election, particularly through the deliberate dissemination of false information on social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook.

D.C. Memo: Mr. President goes to Burnsville

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo, the first of (hopefully) many written by Gabe Schneider, our new Washington correspondent . This week in Washington: The president has continued to stir up threats of violence against a member of the Minnesota delegation, tax day (for us and members of Congress), fundraising day (just for members of Congress), and more.
So let’s get on with it.
Omar in context
On Monday, President Donald Trump visited Burnsville to emphasize his tax plan and what he argues has been a net-positive for Minnesotans. He also took time in Minnesota to tell KSTP-TV’s Tom Hauser that he’s had no second thoughts about his constant barrage of attacks on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar , who represents Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.
Trump spent much of last week attacking Omar, culminating in an Islamophobic video that interspersed one of the nation’s first Muslim congresswomen with images of the September 11 terror attacks. Much of the president’s ire focused on a partial quote from a speech Omar gave about Islamophobic bigotry, in which she in part referred to the attacks as “some people did something.”
House Leader Nancy Pelosi called for Capitol Police to examine Omar’s security needs, following the increased incitement and threats of violence (Twitter is currently collaborating with Capitol Police to review death threats posted online). Meanwhile, a lot of other people also weighed in:
* The Washington Post’s lead Fact-Checker, Glenn Kessler, broke down the context for the speech and asked readers to decide what they think.
* The New York Times’ Astead Herndon delved into how Democrats responded to the president’s vitriolic remarks about Omar and what each response signalled to voters and progressive activists.
* The Times’ White House correspondent, Maggie Haberman, broke down the president’s comments in the context of his public disdain for Islam as a whole, starting with this lede: “President Trump has often seen the political benefits of stigmatizing Muslims.”
* From New York, Lois Beckett at The Guardian wrote about Yemeni bodegas boycotting the New York Post over attacks on Omar.
* And, last but not least, MinnPost’s own Eric Black wrote of Omar’s 9/11 remarks: “She said what she said and it has now entered the outrage factory as if she had said that the 9/11 attacks were no big deal. She did not say anything remotely close to that, at least for me, reading her remarks in their full context. … Omar must know by now that the long knives are out for her. She is choosing not to shut up nor even to back down.”
Worth noting is that Omar’s speech concluded with this remark: “I know as an American, as an American member of Congress, I have to make sure I am living up to the ideals of fighting for liberty and justice. Those are very much rooted in the reason why my family came here.”
Tax day!
Monday was tax day, which for most people means … paying their taxes. But for some folks in DC, it also means more.
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar released her 2018 tax return, revealing a total joint income between her and her husband of $338,483. In all, she has now released 12 years of her taxes.
* The House Blockchain Caucus (a real thing), co-chaired by Sixth District GOP Rep. Tom Emmer, sent a letter to the IRS late last week urging clarity in how they interact with virtual currencies like Bitcoin.
Outside of federal taxes, MinnPost’s Greta Kaul has a great breakdown of where Minnesota’s tax revenue comes from … and where it goes.
Easy as F-E-C
Monday was also the deadline for first quarter of 2019 fundraising, requiring all members of Congress and presidential candidates to release how they raised and spent money from Jan. 1 to March. 31. Here’s what the fundraising totals looked like for members of Minnesota’s delegation:
House of Representatives
* Ilhan Omar, CD5: $832,024
* Angie Craig, CD2: $328,704
* Collin Peterson, CD7: $281,769
* Tom Emmer, CD6: $261,220
* Jim Hagedorn, CD1: $237,680
* Dean Phillips, CD3: $195,811
* Pete Stauber, CD8: $193,347
* Betty McCollum, DC4: $174,200
Senate
* Sen. Tina Smith: $1,094,182
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: $114,673
Amy for America
As you know, Klobuchar is also running for president (which helps explains her smaller Senate-side fundraising), and filings show she transferred $3.57 million from her Senate committee to infuse her presidential campaign with cash. Some other numbers to help you make sense of her bid:
* Total Raised: $5.21 Million
* Total Spent: $1.81 Million
* Cash on Hand (Mar. 31): $6.98 Million
* Percent of Donations Under $200: 34.6 percent
The biggest concern when it comes to a presidential campaign is having enough cash to adequately pay staff, something Klobuchar shouldn’t have to worry about for some time. If anything, it’s often more helpful to look at early polling, which can be a strong indicator of whether if her path to the nomination is viable. Which brings us to …
The latest Klobuchar polling
Two new polls on early primary state voters put the primary into context. These polls are bound to change dramatically as candidates drop out, but are helpful in understanding the current snapshot for how voters are feeling. (n = number of participants. +/- = margin of error).
* Morning Consult (n = 486, +/- 4 percent)
* Amy Klobuchar: 2 percent (both for early primary state voters and Democratic Primary voters as a whole). Context: Sen. Bernie Sanders leads at 29 percent, followed by Joe Biden at 24 percent, followed by the next five candidates, then Klobuchar.
* * Emerson Polling (n = 365, +/- 5.2%)
* Amy Klobuchar: 2 percent. Context: Biden leads at 31 percent, followed by Sanders 23 percent, followed by followed by the next eight candidates, then Klobuchar.
What else?
* Former Alabama senator and attorney general Jeff Sessions visited the University of Minnesota to a full auditorium, and student protestors were vocal about his visit. “People die at the border because of your policies,” one shouted. “How do you sleep at night?”
* Seventh District Rep. Collin Peterson made a surprise visit to a League of Women Voters town hall in Detroit Lakes, primarily lamenting about how he thinks both sides of the aisle don’t get much done. “We’re so dysfunctional. The president’s to blame. The Democrats in the house are to blame,” he said. “We’re all to blame.”
* Finally, all 448 pages of the Mueller Report were released this week, with redactions. When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions informed the president of Mueller’s appointment, the report says he sat back in his chair and said: “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”
Quote of the week
“He is highly biblical and we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime.” —former Sixth District Rep. Michele Bachmann speaking to Christian radio program “Understanding the Times” about Donald Trump.

Hair on fire, media declare William Barr's press conference a disgrace

Texto completo: We all knew this would happen, right?

News reporters and commentators are furious Thursday following Attorney General William Barr’s press conference announcing the forthcoming release of the special counsel’s report on its concluded two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

“[T]his is straight-up PR,” groused CNBC’s John Harwood as Barr reiterated the counsel’s determination that it could not “establish that the members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser complained, “Attorney General or President's personal lawyer? Wiliam Barr is inspire (sic) a long debate with this press conference.”

“That arrogant, willfully misleading press conference was shocking even by 2019 standards. We continue to underreact to our government's transformation into an authoritarian junta,” said New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg.

At the press briefing itself, the mood for the news media was much the same, as no fewer than three Justice Department reporters asked Barr to respond to criticisms that he is acting on behalf of President Trump.

“How do you respond to criticism you’re receiving from congressional Democrats that you’re acting more as a attorney for the president rather than as the chief law enforcement officer?” asked one reporter.

"[H]ere you have remarks that are quite generous to the president, including acknowledging his feelings and his emotions. So, what do you say to people on both sides of the aisle who are concerned that you are trying to protect the president?" asked CBS’ Paula Reid.

Barr responded by saying that the “statements about [Trump’s sincere beliefs that the investigation has undermined his presidency] are recognized in the report, that there was substantial evidence for that. So I’m not sure what your basis is for saying that I’m being generous to the president.”

Reid repeated her question: “What do you say to people who are concerned that you’re trying to protect the president?”

A third reporter asked whether Barr thinks there is any sort of impropriety in his coming out “and sort of what appears to be sort of spinning the report before the public has had a chance to read it?”

Perhaps not realizing that it looks particularly bad to be so angry over the special counsel's determination that no American worked with the Russians to steal the election, frequent MSNBC guest Rich Hasan declared, “This ‘press conference’ would make the editors of Pravda proud.”

Also at MSNBC, noted fabulist Brian Williams claimed Barr must be OK with his legacy being "the AG who took one for the team."

Host Nicole Wallace added, “We know it wasn't a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, but then what was it? Because Robert Mueller spent 22 months looking at it, and if there was nothing, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have taken 22 months to say nothing."

Cable and network news regular Ron Fournier declared, “We may never totally trust an AG, the DOJ or the FBI again One person to blame for that: [President Trump].”

CNN’s chief legal expert Jeffery Toobin also claimed, “You know who else was concerned about leaks? Richard Nixon," adding that Nixon was impeached (no he wasn’t).
It goes on for that like quite a bit, on all fronts.

Honestly, though, was there ever a version of reality where the attorney general re-explaining that there was no collusion between Trump and Russia was not going to inspire a hair-on-fire response from the news media? Given that reporters at national newsrooms were attacking Barr's press conference even before it happened, my best guess to that question is: No.

NYT reporter, editors thought ‘body of Christ’ referred to a statue of Christ in Notre Dame

Texto completo: I have said it before and I will say it again: The media's three greatest blind spots are firearms, faith, and abortion. The ignorance of journalists on these matters seems to be ever-expanding.

The following story, which was flagged first by the New York Post’s Sohrab Ahmari and then explained in much greater detail by the Washington Free Beacon’s Alex Griswold, is about religious illiteracy at the New York Times.

On Monday, as Notre Dame Cathedral was ablaze, Paris Fire Department chaplain Rev. Jean-Marc Fournier braved the flames to rescue both a famed relic as well as consecrated hosts intended for holy communion. These hosts are known more commonly as the “Blessed Sacrament” or the “body of Christ.”

An on-the-ground reporter claimed Monday that Fournier saved "the crown of thorns and the Blessed Sacrament." The chaplain is also quoted by CNN as saying, "The police took the crown and I took the holy sacrament [the wafers, or body of Christ]." Additional footage shows Fournier recounting how he saved the crown and the sacraments, according to Griswold.

To be clear, Fournier, CNN, and the French reporter all tell a story wherein the chaplain rescued the crown of thorns and the Blessed Sacrament. Nothing else. Now, here is how the New York Times initially recounted that story on Wednesday with direct quotes from Fournier [emphasis mine]:

""I had two priorities: to save the crown of thorns and a statue of Jesus ," Father Fournier supposedly said.
[…]
As the chaplain began removing a statue of Jesus , he said, his colleagues were fighting the fire from the cathedral’s towers. The flames had started to threaten the wooden structure around the belfry — putting the whole cathedral at even greater risk.
With the statue in hand , Father Fournier, alone in the nave, gave a benediction to the cathedral, he said.
[…]
As for Father Fournier, he said he hoped to hold that statue of Jesus again soon. “Preferably in a safe place,” he said. “One that has a roof.”
What is this statute business? No one, not even Fournier, has mentioned anything about a statue in any other report.

Oh wait. Oh, no.

The Times reporter, Elian Peltier, almost certainly heard Fournier say “body of Christ” and thought he meant something like a statue. This is the only possible explanation for how a story about a relic and the “body of Christ” became a story about a relic and a “statue of Jesus.” What is worse is that this does not seem to be an issue of "lost in translation." Peltier appears to be fluent in French. That means the Times really assigned the biggest story in the Catholic world to a person who appears to be totally unfamiliar with the basic language of the defining sacrament of Catholicism.

For what is it worth, a correction has by now been added to the Times report, which reads, “An earlier version of this article misidentified one of two objects recovered from Notre-Dame by the Rev. Jean-Marc Fournier. It was the Blessed Sacrament, not a statue of Jesus.”

This is the best example of religious illiteracy at a major newsroom since the time NPR incorrectly described Easter as “the day celebrating the idea that Jesus did not die and go to hell or purgatory or anywhere at all, but rather arose into heaven.”

Misidentifying the “body of Christ” as a little statue of Jesus is almost as funny as when the Times claimed the late St. John Paul II was laid in repose in the papal palace with a “crow’s ear” tucked under his left arm. The Times, of course, meant “crosier,” the hooked staff used by shepherds. A “crow’s ear” is not a real thing, not in Roman Catholicism or anywhere else I know of.

It would be one thing for the Times to bungle some esoteric detail regarding the minutia of Catholic theology. But apparently not knowing that the “body of Christ” is in reference to consecrated hosts, which embody the most fundamental belief of a religion practiced by an estimated 1.3 billion people, is embarrassing and borderline inexcusable.

Texto completo: The battle over whether prosecutors can release police surveillance videos of the New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft and 24 other men charged with solicitation of prostitution in Florida heated up on Wednesday, and a judge ordered them not to do so until he rules on the matter later this month.
The action was the latest step in a battle over whether the surveillance videos, which were taken in January, should be made public. Mr. Kraft and more than a dozen of the other men have refused to accept a plea deal from prosecutors, contending that the video and other pieces of evidence were improperly obtained.
The police have said the videos show the men who have been charged engaging in a variety of sex acts with women who were working under the guise of operating a massage parlor.
Most men charged with similar misdemeanors accept deals that include fines, community service and a presumption of guilt in return for no jail time and having the charges dropped. But Mr. Kraft, a businessman, philanthropist and N.F.L. team owner, has turned the dispute over the video into a bare-knuckle legal fight.
Mr. Kraft has objected to the videos' release. "What is the interest the public has in seeing it? It's basically pornography," his lawyer William A. Burck said Friday in a hearing in Palm Beach County, Fla.
Mr. Kraft has filed motions first to keep the video private so as not to prejudice his case, and then to suppress the video from the evidence entirely because, he argued, it was obtained under false pretenses. His lawyers have argued that the police convinced a judge that video surveillance was necessary because the massage parlor was thought to be a part of a human trafficking ring. No one working there has been charged with human trafficking.
The judge in Mr. Kraft's case has still not ruled on those motions.
The issue over release of the videos is being debated on two fronts: Hua Zhang, 58, and Lei Wang, 39, the two women charged with running a house of prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, in Jupiter, Fla., where Mr. Kraft was arrested, have also sought to keep the videos from being made public. The decision to hold off on any release of the videos until a hearing on April 29 was made by Circuit Judge Joseph Marx, who is overseeing the felony case against the two women.
In court last week, prosecutors handling Mr. Kraft's misdemeanor case had assured the judge that no videos would be released until a judge decided whether they should be made public. But the prosecutors in the separate case against the two women did an about-face, filing court papers Wednesday saying that the law does not give them the legal authority to wait.
Mr. Kraft's lawyers, Mr. Burck, Alex Spiro and Jack A. Goldberger, wrote a letter to the court accusing the Palm Beach County's state attorney's office of "extraordinary and alarming" "gross prosecutorial misconduct."
In their letter to the judge, Mr. Kraft's lawyers quoted a passage from a hearing last week in which the prosecutor told the judge that his office would wait until the judge ruled before taking action.
Mr. Kraft, 77, is accused of paying for sexual acts at the day spa in January. He is charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.
A hearing on whether the video should be allowed in evidence is scheduled for April 26. Then, on April 29, the judge in the case against Ms. Zhang and Ms. Wang of Orchids of Asia will hear arguments on whether the prosecutor is obligated under Florida law to release the video.
Florida has a robust public records law, which says that evidence in criminal cases is public as soon as it is delivered to the defense. On Wednesday, the prosecutors handling the case of Ms. Zhang and Ms. Wang said they were obligated to release the video.
In the documents, the prosecutors wrote, "The Public Records Act does not allow a custodian to delay the production of records to allow the resolution of a constitutional challenge to the release of the documents."
They also added: "It is the practice of the Office of the State Attorney to pixelate or blur depictions of obscene or pornographic images before releasing such records to the public."
The video would have portions blurred.
The threat to release the video could be seen as an effort by prosecutors to gain leverage over Mr. Kraft and encourage him to accept the state attorney's offer, which includes paying a fine and doing community service in return for a guilty plea.
While Mr. Kraft has not admitted guilt, he apologized in March to fans, co-workers and family. He did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment.
Mr. Kraft and his legal team are also facing off against several news organizations, including The New York Times, that have filed a motion to oppose keeping evidence in the case private, as Mr. Kraft has requested.
In their filing, the news organizations said the Constitution of Florida "does not provide a right of privacy in public records."
"We believe they are public records now, but we respect the court's process," Dana J. McElroy, a lawyer representing The New York Times and other news outlets, said in an interview. "Our position is that the release of public records, any public records, does not impair any defendant's right to a fair trial in these circumstances. Much, if not all, of the details concerning the alleged crimes have already been made public."
Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for the state attorney, said the office had filed the notice because prosecutors felt it was important to clarify the office's position on the issue.
"We believe Florida public record law is applicable here, and we are going to follow it unless a court orders otherwise," Mr. Edmondson said just before the court ordered the delay. "We got a public record request, and we are processing it like any other."

Chanting Crowds And a Militant Look

Texto completo: It was like Sinatra headlining in Vegas. On April 21, 1959 -- 60 years ago this Sunday -- thousands of adoring New Yorkers gave a tumultuous welcome to a young celebrity emerging from Penn Station: Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban guerrillas.
Less than four months earlier, he had overthrown a vicious military dictatorship after an against-all-odds campaign, and he was wildly popular in the city, drawing crowds larger than any foreign leader in its history. As throngs chanted "Fi-del, Fid-el, Fi-del," Castro burst through police lines and began shaking hands, as if he were running for office.
It was the opening public-relations volley of a four-day victory lap that captivated New York, and it was a milestone in the history of fashion. According to Sonya Abrego, a historian of men's fashion in the 20th century, this was the moment when what later became known as radical chic (the once-provocative use of visual markers related to militant causes that still influences what we wear today) was really born.
When Castro's photo appeared on the front page of The New York Times after his arrival, it hardly needed a caption: He was instantly recognizable for his unique sartorial style, combining military fatigues, forage cap and unkempt beard.
His 70-strong entourage was packed with khaki-clad ex-guerrillas, whose raffish facial hair had become such a powerful symbol in Cuba that they were known simply as "los barbudos" ("the bearded ones").
"In a way, Fidel, Che and the barbudos were the first hippies," said Jon Lee Anderson, the author of "Che: A Revolutionary Life" and a forthcoming biography of Castro. "They burst onto the scene at the dawn of the TV age as the ultimate sexy rebels. Their sum total of their 'look,' with long hair and beards and berets, was potent, and it played into the cultural zeitgeist."
At the time, many young Americans were showing the first signs of disenchantment with what they saw as the leaden conformity of the Cold War era. Allen Ginsberg's paean to freedom, "Howl," was published in 1956; Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" in 1957. "The Second Sex," by Simone de Beauvoir, was in translation, and the civil rights movement was gaining pace.
The Cubans formed a stylistic bridge between the Beats and the 1960s counterculture, Dr. Abrego said.
"The history of fashion is not linear," she said. "There could have easily been longhaired hippies without Che. But the impression the Cubans made on the sartorial landscape is real." Their revolution was a most photogenic one, and the Cubans' rebellious style infiltrated America.
Designing the Look
The beards had been born of necessity. Castro and a band of some 20 fellow survivors from his amphibious landing in eastern Cuba in December 1956 had no razors.
But their blossoming facial topiary had quickly turned into a "badge of identity," the leader later explained to the Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet, whose interviews with Castro are collected in "Fidel Castro: My Life: A Spoken Autobiography." The accidental style was made permanent "to preserve the symbolism."
Other elements of the revolutionary look came together during the campaign, lovingly cataloged by glossy magazines. In 1958, Fidel's younger brother Raúl was photographed by Life sporting shoulder-length hair and a jaunty cowboy hat.
Photos of the mysterious, handsome Argentine-born medic Ernesto Guevara, known as Che, showed that he, too, was growing his hair long and modeling a soon-to-be-famous black beret.
And it wasn't only men. In early 1958, a Spanish photographer traveled to the Sierra Maestra for Paris Match and came back with images that included a top guerrilla leader, the M.I.T.-educated Vilma Espín, with a white mariposa bloom behind her ear, looking like a prototype flower child.
Also featured was Celia Sánchez, the rebels' key organizer, who had designed her own uniform with green twill tapered slacks and V-neck overblouse (according to Dickie Chapelle, one of the first American war photographers, who traveled with them).
In July 1958, Espín appeared in Life toting a rifle on her hip like Cuba's answer to Bonnie Parker, of Bonnie and Clyde fame. In a Doris Day world on the cusp of the feminist movement, the semiotics were subversive.
Before Castro's 1959 visit to the United States, the Cubans had hired a Madison Avenue P.R. agent, Bernard Rellin, for a princely $6,000 a month, to advise their leader on how to appeal to Americans.
When they met in Havana, Rellin told Castro that the guerrillas should all cut their hair. Castro refused. He knew the power of the rebellious "barbudo" look.
It was a canny decision. By April, Castro's so-called brand had become so renowned that an American toy company produced 100,000 forage caps with strap-on beards for kids, which were put on sale alongside Davy Crockett coonskin hats and G.I. Joe helmets.
Each was emblazoned with the black-and-red logo of the revolutionary 26th of July Movement and the words "El Libertador" ("The Liberator"), evoking the independence hero Simón Bolívar.
Castro's four-day New York visit unfurled in a whirlwind of whiskers and khaki. His picturesque image cropped up in settings both official and touristic: He was received at City Hall by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, he greeted wide-eyed students at Columbia University, he visited The New York Times offices and he spoke to a crowd of 16,000 at the band shell in Central Park.
All of this occurred at the perfect time to influence Americans, said Nathaniel Adams, a writer who specializes in fashion subcultures. The flood of media imagery coincided with the economic boom in the West that created a new class of young consumers with disposable cash.
"This was the first time teenagers around the world started to consciously copy each other's styles," Mr. Adams said. "And the fashions were being created by the kids themselves, not handed down by adults." The highly educated Castro was like James Dean with a progressive political agenda: a rebel with a cause.
A Lasting Influence
On the surface, New York's Fidel infatuation seemed to fade relatively quickly. By the time of his next visit to the city, to address the United Nations in September 1960, Castro was derided for the same style choices that had once seemed so seductive.
The New York Daily News mocked him as "El Beardo," or just "The Beard"; Senator Barry Goldwater lamented that the Cuban "knight in shining armor" had turned out to be "a bum without a shave." Before long, some Americans buzz cuts were staging anti-hippie rallies, holding placards with sayings like "Long Hair Is Communism."
But Castro's influence on fashion would endure. For his 1960 New York visit, he and his entourage moved on from white middle-class America and decamped to a Harlem hotel, the Theresa, where they met Malcolm X and other black leaders.
This time, the style highlight was a cocktail party in the ballroom organized by the progressive group Fair Play for Cuba and attended by 250 bohemian luminaries, including the poets Allen Ginsberg and Langston Hughes, the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson and an array of civil rights activists.
"The proletarian staff of the hotel, the olive green uniform of the 'guerilleros,' the general lack of formality, all helped to emphasize the gaiety and the stimulating, if not revolutionary, character of the meeting," wrote one guest, the European journalist K.S. Karol, of the party.
Ten years later, Tom Wolfe coined the term "radical chic" to mock New York intellectuals who were hypnotized by revolutionary fashions at a party hosted by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers -- who, of course, had taken the paramilitary look from the Cubans and made it their own.
Since then, fashion has only further denatured the style, and now camo pants are available everywhere from Old Navy to Balmain.
"'Radical chic' is a term that seems so 20th century," Ms. Abrego said. "It was once very negative, referring to a style that developed organically, but has been appropriated as a fashionable look without any further political commentary or personal risk. I struggle to explain it to kids wearing Che T-shirts today."

What was worse...AOC's Went of color' or her code switch excuse?

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) came onto the national scene by winning a Democratic primary in 2018, upsetting a 20-year incumbent. Politically, that's impressive, but what intrigued the media about AOC were three visibility factors and one factor of origin.
AOC is a young, Latin, woman from the Bronx.
AOC stated that women like her aren't supposed to be elected to Congress because she doesn't belong to a New York political dynasty and comes from a borough where nearly half the neighborhoods are considered high poverty areas. But AOC's mother told The New York Times AOC was 5 years old when the family moved from the Bronx to Yorktown. AOC's mother said the move was made so AOC could attend better schools.
AOC didn't return to the Bronx until after she graduated college.
When the newly-elected Congresswoman arrived in Washington, she gave an interview. She was asked why she was perceived as a threat by the right wing.
AOC said, "Because I fight back...I don't think they see that they're losing the war...Because they're playing old school politics." Then AOC said, "(Republicans are like), 'We're going to take her down.' Dude, you're out of bullets, you're out of bombs... I'm six days into the term, and you already used all your ammo. So, enjoy being exhausted for the next two years while we run train on the progressive agenda."
As expected, AOC was ridiculed for "talking tough" and her odd use of slang.
Recently, AOC was ridiculed again by her detractors, but this time, it wasn't for her word choice, it was for how she chose to speak to a predominately Black audience. AOC was a featured speaker at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference. AOC told an audience of affluent Black people that she was proud to be a bartender.
Then added, "Aint nothing wrong with that."
AOC continued, "There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy. There's nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat. There's nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work. There's nothing wrong with being a working-class person in the United States of America."
AOC made these statements mimicking a Black southern drawl. Critics compared AOC's "accent of color" to Hillary Clinton's infamous 2007 "Black voice" performance at a Black church in Selma, Alabama. Clinton mimicked, "I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me."
But there's a slight difference between the two.
Clinton was sermonizing in a stereotypical fashion. Her fake religiosity was blasphemous but not belittling. AOC told an affluent Black audience (many of them are more accomplished than the 29-year-old congresswoman) there's nothing wrong with folding clothes, making food, and being working class.
AOC defended herself and said, "Folks talking about my voice can step right off.. .Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture and had to learn to navigate class enviros at school and work knows what's up."
So, AOC's "accent of color" was a code switch to navigate a different class environment?
But the problem is this progressive promoter of upward mobility navigated down, not up, because in progressive identity politics, "Black" is categorized as double blue, Democratic and blue collar, and to add insult to her double down, AOC said, "As much as the right wants to distort and deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act and talk like it."
In politics the cover up is always worse than the scandal. Here the excuse was worse than the accent.

Texto completo: Rep. Ilham Omar, D-Minn. , said death threats against her have spiked as a result of an inflammatory video that was shared by President Donald Trump on Twitter.
Trump is using 9/11 to score political points
By EJ Montini
He's the president of the United States and he pretends that the things he says, when he has the biggest microphone on earth, won't lead to physical harm.
But they can.
Over the weekend President Donald Trump issued an inflammatory tweet against Minnesota Democratic freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar.
It was so bad that even Fox host Chris Wallace refused to play more than five seconds of it, then asked Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders if Trump was inciting violence against Omar.

Sanders said Trump wishes no "ill will" to befall the Muslim congresswoman and added, "The president is not trying to incite violence against anybody. "
The controversy involves a brief clip from a speech Omar gave in March to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she said in part, "CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. "
What the congresswoman clearly meant, if you hear the remarks in context, is that law-abiding American Muslims were the subjects of harassment and more following the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by Muslim extremists.
Trump — and critics of Omar — were outraged by the phrase "some people did something" for not being explicit enough. As if Omar's intent was to diminish the attack.
He tweeted: "WE WILL NEVER FORGET!" juxtaposed with images of the 9/11 attacks.
Omar's remarks were not politically correct. She should have been more sensitive to the feelings we have about 9/11, to the pain it engenders. The sadness. The anger.
But how odd is it for Trump to be haranguing a person over a lack of political correctness?
Omar is a controversial person. She already receives death threats. They've increased since Trump's tweet.
And while he has every right to criticize her, is the president so naïve he can't recognize that the tone of his response was inflammatory enough to incite violence?
Omar issued a statement afterward saying in part: "Violent rhetoric and all forms of hate speech have no place in our society, much less from our country's Commander in Chief. We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop. ”
The video Trump tweeted juxtaposes Omar's "some people" quote with footage of the 9/11 attacks.
So, not only was the president demonizing Omar in a way that could put the congresswoman in danger, but he was using the horrible images of 9/11, pictures of Americans being murdered, to score political points.
What's worse than that?

What others are saying
Jamelle Bouie, The New York Times: "It is easy to tie these attacks to President Donald Trump's history of anti-Muslim rhetoric. But anti-Muslim prejudice was common in Republican politics before he stepped on the political stage with his “birther” charges against President Barack Obama. . . . Donald Trump has simply brought this rhetoric to the bully pulpit of the American presidency. He has taken everything coursing through the last 20 years of Republican politics and made it explicit. It now has an official seal of approval. "
Suad Patton-Bey, The Daily Mississippian: "Freedom of expression is a huge part of our Constitution, so let’s uphold that. Right-wing media will talk relentlessly about the hatred and protests conservative speakers experience on campuses. Candace Owens loves to complain about the intolerance she experiences for being black and conservative but has yet to show any sympathy or solidarity when Muslim-American women are attacked for their beliefs. "
Renée Graham, The Boston Globe: "Racism got Trump to the White House and, with what’s likely to be a hard reelection fight ahead, he’s not going to abandon it now. It’s the kind of stupid tough-guy talk his supporters lap up. In Omar, Trump has found a target that ticks every box: She’s a black woman, an immigrant, and Muslim. "
What our readers are saying
I think Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , has pretty much caused all this commotion all by herself — even before President Donald Trump tweeted anything. So, she shouldn't blame our president for her ignorance.
— Janet Stovall
A president inciting violence against a member of Congress. It's just unbelievable that this is tolerated and even encouraged by Americans today. It's disgusting.
— Tina Leisner McDermott
Omar is using treasonous language, I believe, and our spineless leaders refuse to call her out and remove her from Congress.
— Alan Wigant
Twitter needs to shut down Trump's account. He is breaching his oath to protect Americans, and likely breaking Twitter's community rules.

A Pulitzer Prize for Aretha: Now that's R-E-S-P-E-C-T

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) -- Aretha Franklin is still getting R-E-S-P-E-C-T after death: The Queen of Soul received the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation honor Monday, becoming the first individual woman to earn a special citation prize since the honor was first awarded in 1930.

The Pulitzer board said the award was given to Franklin for "her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades."

Franklin died on Aug. 16 at her home in Detroit from pancreatic cancer at age 76.

The superstar musician was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when she entered the prestigious organization in 1987.

The Pulitzer board most recently awarded a special citation prize in 2010 to Hank Williams, the country-music legend who died in 1953. From the arts world, other recipients include Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, George Gershwin, Ray Bradbury, William Schuman, Milton Babbitt, Scott Joplin, Roger Sessions, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.

Before Monday, only 41 special-citation prizes had been awarded since 1930, and winners have ranged from individual people to organizations and groups, including the New York Times, writers E.B. White, Alex Haley and Kenneth Roberts, and Columbia University and its Graduate School of Journalism. Franklin and the Capital Gazette newspaper received special-citation honors this year.

"Aretha is blessed and highly favored even in death. She's continued to receive multiple awards -- she's received almost every award imaginable and now to get the Pulitzer Prize, it's just amazing," Sabrina Owens, Franklin's niece and the executor of her estate, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday. "Aretha continues to bless us with her music and just paving the way for women going forward. It's thrilling. She would be so happy right now."

When Owens heard the news that Franklin won a Pulitzer, she and the family were "surprised but in another way we were not because that's just the kind of person Aretha was."

"She was just very gifted and talented, and the world is still recognizing that," she said.

Franklin's inclusion into the exclusive club re-confirms the impact her music -- and voice -- had and continues to have on the world. She became a cultural icon and genius of American song, considered by many to be the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her voice transcended age, category and her own life.

Franklin was professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens and a superstar by her mid-20s. Raised in Detroit, she recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half century, including 20 that reached No. 1 on the R&B charts.

But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of Top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," to the wised-up "Chain of Fools" to her unstoppable call for "Respect," transforming Otis Redding's song into a classic worldwide anthem -- especially for the feminist and civil rights movements -- making it one of the most recognizable and heard songs of all-time.

She sold millions of albums and won countless awards, including 18 Grammys, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

She performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and even sang at the funeral for civil-rights pioneer Rosa Parks and at the dedication of Martin Luther King Jr.'s memorial.

Rolling Stone ranked Franklin No. 1 on its list of the Top 100 singers and she was also named one of the 20 most important entertainers of the 20th century by Time magazine, which celebrated her "mezzo-soprano, the gospel growls, the throaty howls, the girlish vocal tickles, the swoops, the dives, the blue-sky high notes, the blue-sea low notes. Female vocalists don't get the credit as innovators that male instrumentalists do. They should. Franklin has mastered her instrument as surely as John Coltrane mastered his sax."

Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, though her family moved to Buffalo, New York, and then settled in Detroit. She grew up singing in the church alongside her father Rev. C.L. Franklin, a prominent Baptist minister who recorded dozens of albums of sermons and music. She joined him on tour and she released a gospel album in 1956. Four years later, she signed with Columbia Records and when her contract ran out in 1966, she joined Atlantic Records.

That's when she blazed the pop and R&B charts with a string of hits, including "Respect," "I Say a Little Prayer," "Think," "Chain of Fools," "Day Dreaming," "(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone," "Rock Steady" and "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)."

Her Grammy-winning album, "Amazing Grace," is one of the seminal albums in not only Franklin's discography, but the canon of American pop music. It is the basis for the recently released concert film "Amazing Grace," filmed over two sessions in January 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the Watts section of Los Angeles.

Michael Jackson's estate hits back at 'Leaving Neverland'

BOSTON (AP) -- The co-executor of Michael Jackson's estate says he's confident the late superstar's supporters will be able to protect his legacy and brand in the wake of a documentary detailing allegations of sexual abuse.

Longtime entertainment attorney John Branca criticized filmmakers of HBO's "Leaving Neverland" for not reaching out to the estate and accused its subjects of being motivated by money.

Branca spoke Tuesday on a panel hosted by the Harvard Institute of Politics.

It's the latest attack by Jackson's estate against the documentary that features the disturbing and detailed stories of Wade Robson and James Safechuck. Their accusations aren't new, but have put Jackson under fresh scrutiny amid the (hash)MeToo movement.

Their attorney, Vince Finaldi, said Branca is seeking to protect Jackson's estate so he can continue to profit from it.

Attacking Trump will never end

Texto completo: I'm beginning to feel sorry for President Trump.
The attacks on him, his policies, his kids, his cabinet, his staff and everyone who's ever worked for him as a caddie by the Democrats and the Trump-hate media will never end.
The political attacks keep coming from dumbos in Congress like Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and the dozens of Democrats who are running for president in 2020.
The judicial attacks keep coming from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California, where Democrats routinely shop to get liberal judges to delay or stop Trump's executive orders for bogus constitutional reasons.
The legal attacks will be coming soon from the Department of Justice's Southern District of New York, which is using its investigation into the hush-money payments Trump made in 2016 to cover up affairs he had a decade earlier as an excuse to fish around in Trump's finances.
It will never matter to Democrats what Robert Mueller's report, Attorney General William Barr or even the U.S. Supreme Court concludes about Russian collusion, obstruction or any other alleged crime Trump did or didn't commit before or after he became president.
The Democrats and the liberal media will always believe Trump won only because he cheated with the help of the Russians. They will never let the facts or the truth get in the way of their permanent anti-Trump agenda or their impossible dream of impeaching him.
With collusion with Russia taken off the table (for non-deranged people, anyway), the Democrats and the people who play journalists on CNN and MSNBC will continue to look for anything else they can use to attack Trump. That includes sliming the reputations or characters of anyone who works for Donald Trump or fails to use their power to bring him down. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has become the first victim.
For two years, he was touted by Democrats and the liberal media as the bipartisan, fair-minded and super-competent Swamp hero who was going find the proof of Trump's collusion and obstruction. But now they see him as a bum, a failure, a partisan Republican hack who is part of a great Republican conspiracy to keep Trump in office.
The Trump-haters newest Devil is Attorney General Bill Barr. Until he wrote his summary of the Mueller Report's "no collusion" findings two weeks ago, he was seen as a fair-minded, by-the-book, respected member of the D.C. establishment.
Now Democrats in Congress are calling him just another untrustworthy Trump puppet who spun Mueller's findings to please his master.
The Democrats still hate Trump so much for "stealing" Hillary Clinton's presidency, they can never let him win anything in Washington. Their blind hate has hurt the country.
We'd have bipartisan healthcare reform, immigration reform and who knows what else if the Democrats weren't so hellbent on stopping Trump from getting legislation he wants through Congress.
There are a million things Donald Trump has done to tick me off. But I can separate his personal flaws and un-presidential manners from what he's been accomplishing in Washington — cutting taxes, boosting the economy, creating jobs, etc. with no help from Democrats and too little help from many Republicans.
I don't know any other human in politics who could have withstood the bipartisan onslaught of hate that President Trump has and still be able to walk around with his head high and a smile on his face. At this point, he can't be hurt politically by what the Democrats in D.C. say or do, or what The New York Times or Washington Post writes.
But sadly for the health and welfare of the country, the Swamp Democrats and the liberal media will never stop trying to destroy President Trump and his team — even after he's reelected in 2020.
Michael Reagan is the son of President Ronald Reagan, a political consultant, and the author of "Lessons My Father Taught Me: The Strength, Integrity, and Faith of Ronald Reagan." He is the founder of the email service reagan.com and president of The Reagan Legacy Foundation.

Texto completo: Today is Tuesday, April 16, the 106th day of 2019. There are 259 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On April 16, 2007, in one of America's worst school attacks, a college senior killed 32 people on the campus of Virginia Tech before taking his own life.
On this date:
In 1789, President-elect George Washington left Mount Vernon, Virginia, for his inauguration in New York.
In 1862, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill ending slavery in the District of Columbia. The Confederacy conscripted all white men between the ages of 18 to 35.
In 1889, comedian and movie director Charles Chaplin was born in London.
In 1945, during World War II, a Soviet submarine in the Baltic Sea torpedoed and sank the MV Goya, which Germany was using to transport civilian refugees and wounded soldiers; it's estimated that up to 7,000 people died.
In 1947, the cargo ship Grandcamp, carrying ammonium nitrate, blew up in the harbor in Texas City, Texas; a nearby ship, the High Flyer, which was carrying ammonium nitrate and sulfur, caught fire and exploded the following day; the blasts and fires killed nearly 600 people. At the South Carolina statehouse, financier Bernard M. Baruch declared: "Let us not be deceived - we are today in the midst of a cold war.
In 1962, New Orleans Archbishop Joseph Rummel excommunicated three local Roman Catholics for fighting racial integration of parochial schools.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from Birmingham Jail in which the civil rights activist responded to a group of local clergymen who had criticized him for leading street protests; King defended his tactics, writing, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
In 1972, Apollo 16 blasted off on a voyage to the moon with astronauts John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and Ken Mattingly on board.
In 1986, dispelling rumors he was dead, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared on television to condemn the U.S. raid on his country and to say that Libyans were "ready to die defending their nation.
In 1996, Britain's Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, the Duchess of York, announced they were in the process of divorcing.
In 2003, the Bush administration lowered the terror alert level from orange to yellow, saying the end of heavy fighting in Iraq had diminished the threat of terrorism in the United States.
In 2008, the Supreme Court upheld, 7-2, the most widely used method of lethal injection, allowing states to resume executions after a seven-month halt. Pope Benedict XVI was welcomed by President George W. Bush as only the second pontiff to visit the White House (after John Paul II) and the first in 29 years.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama issued a statement saying CIA officials who'd used harsh interrogation tactics during the Bush administration would not be prosecuted; the president traveled to Mexico, where he pledged to help the country in its battle against drugs and violence. The crew of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, who'd thwarted pirates off the Somali coast, returned to the U.S.; ship's captain Richard Phillips, held hostage for five days, arrived in Kenya aboard the USS Bainbridge. U.N. nuclear experts who'd been ordered to leave by North Korea departed the country. The Cleveland Indians ruined the Yankees' first game at their new stadium by beating New York 10-2.
Five years ago: More than 300 people, mostly students, died when a South Korean ferry, the Sewol, sank while en route from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju; 172 people survived.
One year ago: The New York Times and The New Yorker won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for breaking the Harvey Weinstein scandal with reporting that galvanized the #MeToo movement. Rap star Kendrick Lamar was awarded the Pulitzer for music, becoming the first non-classical or non-jazz artist to win the prize. American pastor Andrew Brunson went on trial in Turkey in a case that strained ties between that country and the United States; he denied accusations that he aided terror groups or spied against Turkey. (Brunson was convicted but sentenced to time served and was freed from house arrest in October to return to the United States.) Actor Harry Anderson, best known for playing an off-the-wall judge working the night shift of a Manhattan court room on the comedy series "Night Court, was found dead in his North Carolina home; he was 65.
Today's Birthdays: Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI is 92. Actor Peter Mark Richman is 92. Singer Bobby Vinton is 84. Denmark's Queen Margrethe II is 79. Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is 72. Former Massachusetts first lady Ann Romney is 70. NFL coach Bill Belichick is 67. Rock singer and former politician Peter Garrett is 66. Actress Ellen Barkin is 65. Actor Michel Gill is 59. Rock musician Jason Scheff (Chicago) is 57. Singer Jimmy Osmond is 56. Rock singer David Pirner (Soul Asylum) is 55. Actor-comedian Martin Lawrence is 54. Actor Jon Cryer is 54. Rock musician Dan Rieser is 53. Actor Peter Billingsley is 48. Actor Lukas Haas is 43. Actress-singer Kelli O'Hara is 43. Actress Claire Foy (TV: "The Crown) is 35. Figure skater Mirai Nagasu is 26. Actress Sadie Sink is 17.
Thought for Today: "The only graceful way to accept an insult is to ignore it; if you can't ignore it, top it; if you can't top it, laugh at it; if you can't laugh at it, it's probably deserved. - Russell Lynes, American writer (1910-1991).

WASHINGTON -- The Interior Department's internal watchdog has opened an investigation into ethics complaints against the agency's newly installed secretary, David Bernhardt.
Mr. Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil and agribusiness industries, was confirmed by the Senate last week to head the agency, which oversees the nation's 500 million acres of public land and vast coastal waters. He has played a central role in writing policies designed to advance President Trump's policy of "energy dominance" and expanding fossil fuel exploration. He has been dogged by allegations of ethics violations since joining the Trump administration as the Interior Department's deputy secretary in 2017.
Eight senators, all Democrats, and four government ethics watchdog groups have requested that the Interior Department's inspector general open formal investigations into various aspects of Mr. Bernhardt's conduct. Among the chief complaints have been allegations, revealed by three separate New York Times investigations, that Mr. Bernhardt used his position to advance a policy pushed by his former lobbying client; that he continued working as a lobbyist after filing legal paperwork declaring that he had ceased lobbying; and that he intervened to block the release of a scientific report showing the harmful effects of a chemical pesticide on certain endangered species.
In a letter sent Monday to the senators who filed the ethics complaints, Mary L. Kendall, the deputy inspector general of the Interior Department, wrote that she had received seven complaints from "a wide assortment of complainants alleging various conflicts of interest and other violations" by Mr. Bernhardt, adding that she had "opened an investigation to address them."
Mr. Bernhardt has maintained that he did not commit any ethical violations and, in fact, has worked to strengthen the culture of ethical compliance at the Interior Department, in part by hiring dozens of new ethics specialists.
Mr. Bernhardt's spokeswoman, Faith Vander Voort, wrote in a statement, "Secretary Bernhardt is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations." She added, "It is important to note that the Department Ethics Office has already conducted a review of many of these accusations at Mr. Bernhardt's request and determined that Secretary Bernhardt is in complete compliance."
A spokesman for the White House declined to comment.
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has formally requested investigations into Mr. Bernhardt's conduct, and who pushed for the delay of his Senate confirmation, wrote in a statement: "This is exactly why I wanted a delay in Bernhardt's consideration. We now have an Interior Secretary who has been on the job for one full business day and is already under investigation."
The inquiry into Mr. Bernhardt's activities is the latest in a series of ethics concerns around Mr. Trump's top energy and environment officials since the beginning of his administration. Mr. Trump's first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, and his first Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, both resigned last year amid allegations of ethics misconduct.

Morning links: Former Weber State runner Sarah Sellers stunned the sports world in 2018. Here's what she's planning on for this year's Boston Marathon

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Basically, marathon runners fall into two divisions: The professionals who train full-time with the help of sponsors and the amateurs who train during their spare time.
Sarah Sellers broke the mold and stunned the world with a second-place finish at the 2018 Boston Marathon.
The 27-year-old former Ogden High and Weber State runner had an injury that kept her from competing in her senior year, and her life as a nurse anesthetist and busy life stopped her from training regularly and allowed her to heal.
After running just a couple of races, she finished with a time of 2:44:04 on Patriot's Day a year ago.
When a race official told her she had finished second she thought it was a mistake, she told the Deseret News. “No, what place was I really?” Sellers repeated. The official told her again that she was second. “No, I wasn’t second. What was my place?” The official repeated it a third time. “Even then, I had to ask my husband to verify that that had really happened,” she says.
After a whirlwind media tour — her plans of sightseeing Boston after the race were canceled — she now wants to compete in the Olympics. But she's still not running full time, she told The New York Times.
“If I quit my job and trained full time, I don’t see it going well,” she said in an interview last month in New York, before she ran the New York City Half-Marathon. “I’d be a stress case and I’d be more injury-prone. When I balance the two, I think I have better perspective.”
Even though she now has a sponsor, she still works three days a week at a hospital in Tucson, Arizona, Sports Illustrated reports.
“I guess the distinction is probably if you’re making money off of sponsorships or on the races, I’d say, so based on that, technically I’m professional now,” Sellers told Boston.com. “But I still feel like I’m definitely in that other realm. I’m still working another job. I’m kind of in that crossover position, I think.”
Sellers and her coach Paul Pilkington are not shooting for first place in this year's marathon. Or even second place.
“(People) see I got second last year and think I’m going to win it this year or be on the podium,” Sellers told SI. “Initially those kinds of comments would get to me because the odds of that happening are not zero, but they’re close. And that’s being realistic.”
She's instead focusing on setting a personal best of under 2:36.
While her strategy of training as a professional while also having is job is unusual, it works for her — she likes to stay busy.
“Nothing against full-time runners,” she told The New York Times. “I honor what they do, but it seems like they have a lot of Netflix time.”
Kyle Korver's impact
The Utah Jazz forward Kyle Korver struggled in Game 1 on Sunday night, scoring just two points while not recording a shot, but he's still making an impact with his essay on white privilege.
Former U.S. vice president Joe Biden called the piece "powerful".
https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1117150655024717825
Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. applauded Korver for courage.
"... Becoming that sort of advocate takes moral fiber, a willingness to shut up, listen, learn, self examine — and speak out. It’s heartening to be reminded that such courage still exists. In an era of progress under assault, African Americans have every reason to feel anxious, angry and betrayed."
Toronto Star columnist Morgan Campbell appreciated Korver's words, but says now comes the hard part: action.
"If you work in media, you’ve probably tweeted a story with a sexy headline, then watched hundreds of retweets yield only a few dozen clicks on the embedded link. And clicking links is easy. Heeding Korver’s call to action is difficult and awkward and inconvenient for a lot of white people whose hurt feelings often derail meaningful conversations on racism."

Texto completo: A Fordham University senior who was climbing up the campus' iconic bell tower fell to her death in a tragic accident early Sunday morning.
Sydney Monfries, 22, fell through an opening in a stairway landing at Keating Hall and plummeted down the inside of the clock and bell tower, according to the New York City Police Department. The fall was about 30 feet, school officials said. Monfries was found critically injured and later died.
The tower on the Bronx, New York, campus is off-limits to students and locked at night, according to the university. It was locked before Monfries and her friends entered the the building, the university confirms.
“There are no words sufficient to describe the loss of someone so young and full of promise — and mere weeks from graduation,” university president Rev. Joseph M. McShane said in a statement.

Fordham University's student newspaper, The Observer, reported that climbing the tower is a kind of "rite of passage" before graduation.
Monfries posted video from the top of the tower early Sunday with the caption "Bell tower," The New York Times reports.
McShane said Monfries' bachelor’s degree will be presented to her parents.
Authorities are investigating how Monfries gained access to the tower, which contains a clock and tank for firefighting water. There is no bell in the tower. Ringing comes from a recording.

Texto completo: Eugene Victor Debs left school at the age of 14, to scrape paint and grease off the cars of the Vandalia Railroad, in Indiana, for 50 cents a day.
That's how Jill LePore, The New Yorker's critic-at-large, began her account of one of the most celebrated populists in American history, Eugene V. Debs. He ran for president five times between 1900 and 1920.
Contrast Debs' origin story with that of another populist more prominent today.
"It has not been easy for me ... My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars."
That's President Donald Trump's unique take on his humble beginnings. He offered it at a New Hampshire town hall event in October 2015. A New York Times investigation last year declared he was actually getting $200,000 of his father's wealth each year while still a toddler, and has received more than $400 million from his old man's real estate empire. But what's the point of nitpicking?
Before Mr. Trump, no populist - and perhaps no human - ever had followed "not been easy for me" with the statement that daddy had loaned him a measly million. That the Democrats nonetheless lost much of the working class to Mr. Trump shows how far the party has slipped.
But we're going to be hearing of more "populists" as the 2020 presidential campaign warms. The term is defined by Merriam-Webster as "a member of a political party claiming to represent the common people," but can it have any meaning if it includes Mr. Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders and Eugene Debs on the left?
A cursory search of the PG computer files show we had the word "populist'' in stories with the name "Donald Trump" 321 times since January 2014. Some 57 times the word and name were paired in the same paragraph. The word was paired in "Bernie Sanders" stories only 99 times, 32 times in the same paragraph.
Still, considering that there were more than 11 times as many Donald Trump stories as Bernie Sanders stories, the press applied the word more readily to the left. Scanning the coverage, I think I finally know what "populist" means in modern context.
When we in the media use it, we're not so much describing a candidate claiming to represent the common people. Every politician and commentator, no matter how rich or elevated or sneering, claims to represent the common people. Voters get that, and long ago became cynical about that professed commitment.
So when media apply the word "populist" to a politician these days, this is what they really mean: The people showing up for this candidate actually seem to believe him/her. Rightly or wrongly, they see this politician listening to them in ways that others still aren't.
Democrats are still having trouble figuring out why they lost in 2016. They readily criticize Trump supporters for being blind to his faults and sins, but would be better off asking themselves why their campaign pitch was off-key. Mr. Trump took Pennsylvania in 2016 by dominating the counties where the jobs weren't. Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Economic Development found Mr. Trump won big in the eight counties that saw a decline in employment of 10 percent or more between 2007 and 2015. Hillary Clinton took the big urban counties more in tune with the global economy - and they weren't quite populous enough.
Mr. Trump already has won more presidential elections than Mr. Debs did in five tries. The latter's highest vote total came in 1920, when he tallied more than 900,000 votes as the Socialist Party candidate - while in prison for urging resistance to the draft. Yet much of what Debs advocated - women's suffrage, abolition of child labor, maximum-work hours and minimum-wage laws - is now the law of the land.
Those weren't Debs' only legacies. I know this because I'm a baseball geek and, long ago, I became curious about Debs Garms, the Pirate who won the National League batting title in 1940 when he hit .355. I learned Garms was born in Bangs, Texas, in 1907, the eighth of 10 children, and was named after Eugene Debs.
If the Democrats want to reach the voters they once had, they'll need to inspire connections like that. While I know of nobody naming their babies "Trump" in the past few years, there has been a recent bump in children named "Melania," "Ivanka" and "Barron." (Democrats may take solace in knowing "Donald" is down since 2015.)

Texto completo: Rhett Miller is the frontman for rock band Old 97’s, a solo singer-songwriter, an essayist and a podcaster.
And he’s also a father of two, which indirectly led to his newest gig of picture-book writer. “No More Poems! A Book In Verse That Just Gets Worse” (Little, Brown, $17.99) is a compendium of wry kid-friendly verses on everything from sibling strife to the irresistible lure of screens: “I used to go to Mom’s house/With a birthday cake/Now I simply text her/Don’t even have to bake.”
The book’s roots stretch back several years, to the bedtime routines for his now-teenagers.
“I would pull out Shel Silverstein, Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey and we would read each other poems,” explains Miller, who will be at BookPeople on Monday. “There was something so interactive and immersive about it. We would talk about the characters in the
poems. … I watched them fall in love with the humor and the intelligence in them, especially the Shel Silverstein poems.”
Fast-forward a few years and Miller was on tour and missing his kids. The usual phone check-ins didn’t always result in the best conversations, so he hatched a plan.
“I knew if I got them on FaceTime I wouldn’t be able to hold their interest, but if I went out and brought them a new poem to look at … I could trick them into spending more time,” he said.
A routine was born. He’d get up early, find a coffee shop and write a draft of a poem, which he’d then text to his kids. Post-school, they’d call in with their notes.
“Part of why it was so fun and so easy is that as I was doing it, I didn’t think of it as something that was going to become a commercial enterprise, which takes a lot of the pressure off,” he says. “I would say, ‘Let me have it, tell me what you really think.’”
They would, indeed. They liked when a poem assumed a certain level of intelligence and employed higher-level language. And they didn’t shy away from informing Miller, “No, Dad, this sucks.”
Indeed, Miller hasn’t escaped the universal challenge of seeming uncool to his kids. To wit, “Rock Star Dad,” written in the voice of Miller’s then-13-year-old son:
“One guy at the show/Got so worked up I thought he’d cry/I’m like are you kidding?/My dad’s such a boring guy/I guess I like his scrambled eggs/He gives a mean foot rub/But why must these fanatics/Pack themselves into the club?”
Expressive, energetic illustrations spring off the pages of “Poems,” created by Caldecott medalist and New York Times best-selling author and illustrator Dan Santat.
The pairing had an unlikely beginning: Miller was listening to Sarah Enni’s “First Draft” podcast, which spotlights authors, and Santat was the guest.
“I thought, ‘This guy sounds so cool; he sounds like somebody I want to hang out with. I wonder if his stuff is any good?’” Miller’s editor indulged him with an ask of the much-celebrated Santat — who signed on to the project right away.
Though they didn’t get to meet until after the proofs were complete, the two now tour together.
“I learned so much from the way he interacts with kids,” says Miller, who credits Santat with inspiring on-the-spot poem writing from audience contributions.
“It’s so important to stress to the kids their own agency. Any one of them can do this. They can make art.”
And what do his in-home critics think of “Poems” now that it’s out in the world?
“Their voiced admiration is so grudging,” Miller jokes. “When the book came in and we’re sitting there with this hardback book and they both kind of let out this … noise: ‘Oh, my God, Dad, it’s real.’ I think that they had kind of always thought it was something we’d joke about, but it would never really happen.”

NYC Chinese eatery heats up cultural appropriation debate

Texto completo: A New York City restaurant owner who touted her "clean" American-Chinese cuisine and derided Chinese dishes as swimming in "globs of processed butter," sodium and MSG is renewing the long-simmering debate about stereotyping and cultural appropriation in the restaurant world.
Arielle Haspel, who is white and a certified health coach, told the dining website Eater that she wanted to offer modified, "clean" versions of typical Chinese menu items. In a now deleted Instagram post, Haspel said that a Chinese noodle dish, lo mein, can make people feel "bloated and icky."
Online critics pounced, including New York Baohaus restaurateur and author Eddie Huang who dismissed Lucky Lee's as "the Fyre Fest of food & 'wellness,'" on the restaurant's Instagram page.
Haspel has since apologized, but her comments are the latest misstep in a succession of restaurateurs and TV chefs who have been criticized for insensitivity when dealing with food from a culture that's not their own.
Robert Ku, a professor of Asian American studies and food studies at Binghamton University, New York, said Haspel came off as relying on age-old stereotypes of Chinese food being unsanitary or grotesque. It was especially tone-deaf in New York City where most locals regularly eat Chinese food, he added.
"These are long-standing tropes that have followed specifically Chinese food more than any other cuisine," said Ku, who has written about the cultural politics of Asian food in the U.S. "What she's focused on is health and being clean, which implies the others were not."
He also said it's a myth that Chinese-American restaurants use MSG. Most cut it out of their kitchens in the 1970s because it was so unpopular, making Haspel's reference problematic, Ku said.
Haspel was apologetic in an interview Friday with the New York Times .
"We were never trying to do something against the Chinese community. We thought we were complementing an incredibly important cuisine, in a way that would cater to people that had certain dietary requirements," she said. "Shame on us for not being smarter about cultural sensitivities.
She previously acknowledged the uproar via Instagram and promised to listen and reflect on people's comments.
She did not return messages from the AP seeking comment.
White TV chefs like Andrew Zimmern and Gordon Ramsay have been skewered for their respective Asian restaurants (both of which also use the adjective "lucky" in their name).
Zimmern last year said in an interview that his Lucky Cricket restaurant in Minnesota was saving the souls of people who dine at "(expletive) restaurants masquerading as Chinese food" in the Midwest. The "Bizarre Foods" host later apologized.
Ramsay, who is British, is opening the Japanese-inspired Lucky Cat restaurant in London this summer. In a press release in February, the "Kitchen Nightmares" star promised a restaurant that would be "revolutionary" and "authentic," but many noted the lack of Asians in key executive positions.
On the flipside, there are chefs who have earned reputations as visionaries for mixing cuisines. Chef Roy Choi elevated the food truck when his Kogi BBQ hit the streets of Los Angeles in 2008. Choi combined his Korean roots with tortillas and came up with mouthwatering munchies like Korean short rib tacos.
Being against cultural appropriation doesn't necessarily mean being against anyone cooking outside of their own ethnicity or culture, said Ku, the professor. It's the line between appropriation and appreciation where things can get tenuous.
"What people are reacting to is saying 'For generations, Chinese in America were doing stuff but they did it horribly. As a white person, I can do it better,'" Ku said.
New York restaurateur Stratis Morfogen, who is of Greek descent, doesn't worry about the cultural appropriation accusations against his steakhouse for its Chinese-inspired items.
Brooklyn Chop House, which opened last fall, offers cheeseburgers, pastrami and French onion soup encapsulated in Chinese-dumpling form. Morfogen is collaborating with singer Patti LaBelle to bring the dumplings to frozen food aisles later this year, packaged in reusable bamboo steamers.
"If people didn't move forward or innovate or create and fuse different cultures together, the culinary landscape would be pretty boring," Morfogen said.
Morfogen employs more than 15 chefs from China across his restaurants and a Chinese chef is also one of his partners. He thinks restaurant owners worried about inadvertently stereotyping just need to think twice before they speak.
"I really believe that those words are insensitive and it hurts people," Morfogen said. "I don't think that is what food is meant to be. I think food is meant to bring all the cultures together and respect each other."

You call it a 'democracy,' but I call it a 'republic'; National Viewpoint

Texto completo: One of this age's great crank ideas, that the U.S. is a "republic" and not a "democracy," is gaining so much ground that people in Michigan are trying to rewrite textbooks to get rid of the term "democracy." And the discussion is such a mess that a New York Times article about the fight manages to get it wrong.
The truth is actually simple: For all practical purposes, and in most contexts, "republic" and "democracy" are synonyms. The big difference is that the first comes from Latin and the latter from Greek. To say that the U.S. is a republic, not a democracy, is like claiming to eat beef and pork but not cows and pigs.
The debate may seem like hair-splitting, but it is important in the same way all assaults on knowledge are important - it's part of the never-ending fight against attempted partisan intervention into education, whether it's denying evolution or pretending the Civil War wasn't about slavery. But it's most important because opposing the idea of democracy can be a step toward opposing the reality of democracy, at a time when voting and other structures of formal equality are at risk.
In the Michigan case, the eradication of the word "democracy" is being pushed by conservatives, who want the K-12 social studies curriculum to "be based on a close, originalist reading of the United States' founding documents," according to the Times. Why they care isn't really clear. At one point, conservatives were equally obsessed with being for "liberty" and not "freedom." Now it's this one.
The fight over language long predates the U.S. itself. Here's how the confusion started: For centuries, European (and eventually American) proponents of popular government looked to the ancient Roman republic for inspiration. It's not that they actually wanted to create a new Rome, but they viewed that era as a symbol of long-lasting non-autocratic government. So the American revolutionaries called what they were creating a republic, even though it really had nothing to do with the actual institutions of Rome.
Since Rome was popular, they used Latin words. So James Madison in Federalist 10 described the good version of popular rule, which employs a "scheme of representation," as a republic, whereas bad government - "democracy" - doesn't have the same feature. In fact, the classical world never really had the concept of representation. Madison's vocabulary, which he shared with other 18th century proponents of popular rule, was just a mild form of propaganda. That's all that "a close, originalist reading" will discover.
In the 19th century, Athens became popular, and so politicians such as Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln started calling popular rule "democracy." As with Rome, they weren't actually imitating Athens; they just were associating their goals with a popular civilization.
What Americans in the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries all have in common is that at no time has anything other than some form of democracy/republic gained even a small amount of adherents. Even supposedly "undemocratic" portions of the Constitution, such as the original Senate (chosen by state legislatures), or the courts, or the Electoral College, are just forms of popular rule, not an alternative to it.
When Madison said the U.S. was a republic and not a democracy he meant (in today's vocabulary) that it was a representative democracy, not a direct democracy. Given that all modern democracies employ a "scheme of representation," that's an unimportant distinction today. But questions about what counts as a democracy - what it means to have popular government - are highly important, and contested, right now. The biggest of those concern who counts as citizens, and ensuring that those who are included as part of "the people" have full citizenship.
So to say that the U.S. is not a democracy is to at least imply a position on the actual questions about democracy that people debate today. I don't really know whether the "republic-not-a-democracy" folks are sincerely just misguided pedants or if they are actively trying to use a confusion in the language to place restrictions on voting rights. Either way, they're just plain wrong. In 21st century America, democracy and republic should be used interchangeably.

The First Subway Fare Increase Took Almost Half a Century

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
It was July 1, 1948, or, as many subway riders called it, "D-Day." Ever since the New York City subway started rolling in 1904 the fare had been a nickel.
Now, after 44 years, the price was doubling.
So the lead-up to Dime Day was, naturally, marked by widespread anger and controversy. In fact, one legal battle made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.
Well before then the issue of whether to increase the fare had challenged many mayors, become the subject of campaign promises and provoked fierce clashes with powerful interest groups.
Of course, all fare hikes are unpopular, including the one set to go into effect on April 21 with riders grumbling about having to pay for an unreliable system. In 1970, dozens were arrested while protesting an increase. In 1995, an increase was unsuccessfully challenged in federal court as a civil rights violation.
But none were as fiercely contested as the first one. The nickel fare held steady through two world wars, the Great Depression and 10 mayors. New York City kept the same fare long after other cities, including Chicago and Philadelphia, had raised their fares.
"Almost every transit property in the United States raised its fare in the 1920s, and because of the political pressure and the fact that the fare had become a political issue, New York didn't," said Peter Derrick, the author of "Tunneling to the Future: The Story of the Great Subway Expansion That Saved New York."
But as a result, he said, the subway started "to fall apart because there was never enough money to keep the system going, to keep the system operating, as well as to maintain it."
The nickel fare was part of the agreement the city had with the companies that operated the subway, the Interborough Rapid Transit and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Companies, both of which came to be widely reviled by New Yorkers for their poor service. The IRT sought to set aside the contract and raise the fare. The city challenged the move in a case that reached the Supreme Court. The case was sent back to state courts, where the company ultimately lost.
When the two privately-run lines were unified with the city-run line in 1940, the fare remained a nickel.
The push to raise the fare gained steam after World War II. Ridership was soaring -- on weekdays in 1946 average ridership was more than 6.4 million -- and the city was emerging from years of wartime spending cuts. The subway had become crowded and unsafe and significant investment was needed to upgrade and expand the system.
A resolution put before the City Council declared that the subway was "in such a deplorable state of neglect and disrepair as to be a disgrace to The City of New York and a menace to public safety, heath and decency."
The city was operating the subway at a loss forcing it to spend less on other services like hospitals, schools, prisons, parks and libraries and other critical functions. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency controlled by the governor that now operates the subway, was not created until the 1960s.)
The nickel fare was also seen as preventing pay raises for city employees, including transit workers, and critics argued that the city was essentially providing a free service to riders.
The real estate industry lobbied for a fare increase because property owners were seeking relief from a municipal tax used to help pay for the subway, though they did not find much support.
"There wasn't a lot of sympathy among working people for the complaints of real estate that they'd have to lift a heavier burden in terms of financing the government," said Joshua Freeman, a history professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. "This was a moment where there was a pretty strong kind of -- today we call it populist, I might even call it class-based -- kind of way of thinking about these public problems."
Increasing the fare would hurt many New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet.
"It was a real concern," Mr. Freeman said. "The doubling of the transit fare represented an actual significant pinch in the standard of living of working New Yorkers, the vast majority of whom used public transportation to get to work."
The mayor, William O'Dwyer, had originally been opposed to raising the fare, arguing that it would amount to a "harsh and unbearable tax" on low-income families. But Mr. O'Dwyer, realizing that the city faced a growing financial crisis, appointed a committee to consider the issue.
The committee found that it was "confronted with the panorama of a city bursting at its seams and our community asking for increased public services" and that such services were suffering. The panel recommended a fare hike and Mr. O'Dwyer, facing what some described as the "inexorable arithmetic" of the city's finances, became the first Democratic mayor to break with the party's commitment to the nickel fare.
The mayor was aided by fissures among some labor groups, who had long been opposed to a rise. Some came to see a fare raise as the only viable path toward a wage increase for transit workers and in a prominent move, Michael J. Quill, the leader of the Transport Workers Union, split with other labor groups and supported an increase.
An editorial in The New York Times captured the mood of the moment when it noted that "we watched the skies yesterday, and City Hall probably did too, to see whether the heavens would fall after the Mayor announced the end of the five-cent fare, but nothing happened."
The day of the fare increase, described as a "siege of dimes" in an article in The Times, turned into something of a spectacle. The mayor had been on vacation in Puerto Rico but flew back to supervise the change. Hundreds of police officers were deployed to subway stations during rush hour to prevent chaos as passengers adjusted to the new fare.
The city had prepared for months, adjusting and testing thousands of turnstiles to ensure they would accept dimes.
Hundreds gathered at midnight to witness the last nickel and first dime fares at the Times Square station. There Carmen Gherdel, 30, of Queens, was the last one to pay five cents, while Esther Pollack, 22, of Brooklyn, became the first to pay a dime.
While there were some delays and confusion, as well as faulty turnstiles, New Yorkers quickly adapted. The Times noted that the "heat-plagued men and women of Gotham poured through changed-over subway turnstiles after midnight last night, meekly as sheep turn into a familiar fold, dropping dimes instead of nickels without protest."
The increase would leave a lasting legacy, playing a role in the eventual formation of the transportation authority as a way of insulating the subway, including debates about the fare, from the kind of political gamesmanship that kept the fare a nickel for nearly half a century.
The 1948 increase "sets the stage for what you now ultimately have today where there have been regular fare increases over two- or three-year periods to keep up with inflation," said Andrew Sparberg, a transportation historian and the author of "From a Nickel to a Token: The Journey from Board of Transportation to MTA." "People are always going to be angry about the subway fare but they realize that it's going to go up regardless of whether they like it or not."

Texto completo: "Lottery Day" delivers a comic and dramatic win — as well as a victory lap — for prolific Chicago playwright Ike Holter. And audiences can enjoy the payout as well thanks to a raucous world-premiere production at Goodman Theatre.
The play marks a celebratory, elegiac conclusion to Holter’s ambitious seven-play "Rightlynd Saga." He packed each of his savvy works, set in his Rightlynd neighborhood of the fictional 51st Ward, with real-life, ripped-from-the-headlines Chicago issues — from school closures in "Exit Strategy" to self-made superheroes tackling gang violence in "Prowess." Die-hard theater fans, who first discovered Holter’s early works in tiny storefront spaces, could follow recurring characters throughout the cycle.
"Lottery Day" is the same, though you don’t need to have seen previous "Rightlynd" plays to go with the flow.
Director Lili-Anne Brown’s production promises fun from the start.
"Lottery Day" takes place at a backyard barbecue party thrown by the powerful neighborhood matriarch Mallory (J. Nicole Brooks). At first, it looks like Mallory is hosting the gathering to annoy her nosy and easily offended neighbor Vivien (Michele Vazquez). Vivien’s angularly modernistic home shows just how much Rightlynd has gentrified and changed (a major credit to set designer Arnel Sancianco’s realistic scenic work).
But Mallory is really using the party to mask the anniversary of a family tragedy. And the carefully curated guest list of Rightlynd regulars could potentially turn friends into foes — especially when Mallory reveals weird cash prize contests.
Holter pens snappy and overlapping dialogue throughout "Lottery Day." He also mines humor from his characters as they indulge in copious amounts of liquor and frequent puffs of pot.
Pat Whalen as the former vice principal Ricky and Aurora Adachi-Winter as the theater artist Tori are both hilarious as they get overly analytical about their increasingly altered states.
There’s also great character work by Sydney Charles as the former aldermanic employee Zora and Mckenzie Chinn as money manager Cassandra. Their characters’ stewing rivalry entertainingly teeters on the brink of getting either rancorously renewed or warily appeased.
Also adept are Robert Cornelius as car salesman Robinson, Tony Santiago as the store owner Nunley and Tommy Rivera-Vega as homeless wannabe rapper Ezekiel. They reveal a world of hurt as others jab at emotional wounds over broken ambitions and deferred dreams.
But the main dramatic action focuses on Mallory, and Brooks exposes tremendous depth as a woman haunted by painful losses. Though Mallory is a master manipulator, she gets hurt and violently outraged when a secret is exposed involving her close family friend, Avery (a powerfully stoic and commanding James Vincent Meredith).
If there’s one aspect of "Lottery Day" that feels arbitrary, it’s the reason behind Mallory pushing her guests through strange party games. Yes, there’s a stinging revelation about why her cash prize is so contentious. But her malevolent motivation is puzzling.
Otherwise, "Lottery Day" wins out as a fitting conclusion to the "Rightlynd Saga."
With Holter breaking into TV (The New York Times credited him as one of the writers for the new FX series "Fosse/Verdon"), we can only hope that he won’t entirely abandon Chicago’s theater scene. As the Rightlynd Saga has shown, he excels at reflecting the messy complexities of living in the Windy City.

PENGUINS CAN'T AFFORD CROSBY, GUENTZEL BEING INVISIBLE MEN AGAIN FOR GAME 2

Texto completo: UNIONDALE, N.Y.
The Penguins handled a wealth of queries Thursday about how they could make Friday look a lot less like Wednesday, but by far the most pressing question - at least in my head - never got asked, probably because it wasn't clear who could answer it.
If Penguins co-owner Ron Burkle purchases the National Enquirer, the possibility of which turned up Thursday in The New York Times, could he get an interview with Penguins co-owner Mario Lemieux?
Might be something to tuck in there between the latest Michael Jackson revelation (Jacko!) and the J-Lo/A-Fraud goings on.
Lemieux is in New York with the club, but eschewed the off-day practice, not that he would have said anything either way. You're more likely to see Pirates owner Bob Nutting quoted somewhere than your are to come across a fresh or even stale take from Mario. And compared to Lemieux, at least in terms of frequency with public discourse, Art Rooney II is practically Stephen A. Smith.
In any event, The Times said the Burkle-National Enquirer talks still could fall apart, but I don't think it'll be because of something Lemieux blabbed.
No one asked Sidney Crosby or Jake Guentzel a question related to the pending Enquirer purchase, but a playoff-sized knot of media gathered near the corner of the closet they call the visitors locker room at Nassau Coliseum, the corner where Crosby and Guentzel's lockers are adjacent, the corner where 75 regular-season goals are represented across maybe 6 feet of carpet.
But there were no goals in Game 1. No goals, no assists, and through this series' first 60-plus minutes, nothing worth noting so much as the Crosby-Guentzel-Bryan Rust line was a combined minus-4 in the 4-3 overtime loss Wednesday night against the New York Islanders.
"We've got to make sure that we manage the puck; that's a big thing," said Crosby about 14 hours after managing exactly two shots on 29 shifts, or two more shots than Guentzel. "They really feed off those turnovers. They backtrack hard. If we limit our turnovers, then we give ourselves a chance to go the other way and make things happen."
Crosby answered questions for five minutes, 13 seconds, and mentioned that this was the playoffs seven times, as though no one has noticed that he has two goals in the past month.
When I ventured that the Islanders actually seemed more comfortable, more in their own rhythm, when his line was on the ice than at other times, Sid chalked that up to playoff hockey as well.
"It's a playoff series; it's physical, it's tough," The Captain said. "That's the way they tried to play, and they did a good job. Give them credit. They did a good job."
Credit goes essentially to New York's Casey Cizikas, its checking-line center and his mates Cal Clutterbuck and Matt Martin, who brings to this equation a 6-foot-3, 220-pound presence and more hits than anyone in either uniform over the past six months. Martin dealt seven more crunchers Wednesday night, and, even if the Penguins didn't look exactly intimidated, they didn't look anything close to comfortable either.
"We've got to help our [defense] out on their tough forecheck," said Guentzel, who led the Penguins with 40 goals this season. "We've got to give the [defense] some more time to get the puck up ice. We've got to just move by this, we can't dwell on it. But they played hard. They get in on the forecheck and they make it so that we don't have much ice out there. We've got to find ways to create offense other ways and we've got to be better with our all-around game."
Guentzel wasn't trying to deflect any responsibility for this little Penguins predicament; he was merely intimating that in Game 1 there were several aspects of the club's overall performance that weren't just equally ineffective, but competitively lethal.
What Kris Letang was doing way up ice in overtime, other than challenging the Islanders 1-on-3, was one of those questions that might spur Burkle to buy Psychology Today rather than the Enquirer.
Letang explained it this way on the day after he had lost the puck to spark the Islanders rush that produced the winning goal.
"I knew I was the first guy on the rush and I lost control when I tried to pull up," said the veteran defenseman. "I was trying to put myself into a shot position but when I pulled back, I lost it."
Asked if he had realized he might be made to pay for such a calculation, he said the only thing he could.
"Yeah . yeah . yeah."
Coach Mike Sullivan had put it a different way in the immediate aftermath. I think the phrase was, "I'm not sure we had the awareness we needed in that situation."
Well that requires no explanation. Unlike this Enquirer business.

Adding Depth To an Idyllic Land

Texto completo: There are books that launch you into worlds unimaginable. Others hold up a mirror that reflects back a person who is slightly recognizable. I did not expect both to be true for one book. But in Esmeralda Santiago's 1993 memoir "When I Was Puerto Rican," in which she traces her childhood in Puerto Rico and her family's migration to Brooklyn, New York, from the late forties through the fifties, Santiago managed to evoke familiarity while also illuminating a place and a family dynamic I thought I already understood.
I discovered Santiago's memoir as a senior at Binghamton University in upstate New York. Most of my friends had already graduated, and I felt completely isolated and lost, unsure of where I would land next or what to do with a bachelor's degree in history. Battling homesickness and self-doubt, I searched for an anchor. At a thrift store in downtown Binghamton, I found it in a barely used copy of "When I Was Puerto Rican." My last semester, I read the book countless times.
The island of Puerto Rico, where my parents came from, is displayed with beauty and poignancy by Santiago. As seen through the eyes of a young girl, a walk to school is cinematic ("guayaberas in front of a dry good stores swayed in the breeze like ghosts in daylight") or dangerous ("the foul air was thick and oppressive, clinging to us as if anything new, clean and fresh had to be contaminated"). My mind was flooded with memories of visiting Puerto Rico as a kid, but the island Santiago described was not the one I knew. To me, Puerto Rico was an idyllic place filled with beaches, coconut candies and adventure. Santiago gave my imagined Puerto Rico depth, dimension and historical grounding.
But what makes "When I Was Puerto Rican" feel so intimate is Santiago's depiction of her mother, Ramona Santiago, whom she calls Mami.
Santiago's Mami is larger than life, a parent to 11 children who must contend with a roving partner who leaves her fighting to keep her family afloat. Mami is self-sufficient in an era when it was rare for women to display such independence, and Santiago is able to depict the duality of a strong woman who must contend with quiet despair: "She seemed so far away, yet I sensed the heat from her body, smelled the rosemary oil she rubbed on her hair. I didn't want to leave her but was afraid to come closer, so I leaned against a mango tree and stared at my toes against morivivi weed." Santiago deftly illustrates a young girl's inability to fully understand her mother's hurt.
There are so many scenes with Mami that stand out, like when she insists her kids strip and run out in the rain for good luck, or when a simple lesson on ironing clothes becomes a loving moment between mother and daughter. After Santiago's family moves to the United States, her relationship with Mami shifts, as Santiago explores her newfound freedom, and her mother leans on her to help navigate the new city. In one scene, for instance, Santiago must translate for her mother at the welfare office after she is laid off from work. Barely fluent in English herself, Santiago describes being afraid to use the wrong word and causing the social workers to say no, which she knew could lead to eviction. Still, Mami retains her fierce spirit: "'We're not going there looking like beggars,' she said, and while we waited she kept reminding me to sit up, to stay alert, to look as neat and dignified as the women on the other side of the partition," wrote Santiago.
These moments in the book validated my similar childhood experiences. I too have been in the position of translating for my mother and being her guide through unwelcoming spaces. Santiago reminded me how these responsibilities weighed on me and gave me words for feelings I did not understand. I was also able to see a tiny bit of what my mother's childhood might have been like on the island and to develop a deeper appreciation for what it took for her to survive in New York. Like Santiago's Mami, my mother worked in factories and tried to mold this harsh, unfamiliar city into a place of possibility for her children. "When I Was Puerto Rican" became a window into understanding fearless women and the decisions they make. I mine the relationship between mothers and their daughters in my own fiction, and aim to bring my characters to life as Santiago did with Mami.
After finishing her first memoir, I was not ready to let go of Santiago's prose. I read "Almost a Woman," her second memoir, which digs deeper into her teenage years in New York City. Santiago's teenagehood is defined by her struggle to break free from her mother's protective rules. She continues -- and concludes -- her documentation of her life with the 2004 memoir "The Turkish Lover," which covers her adulthood and a passionate affair with a man she calls "the Turk," and later delves into fiction with novels like "America's Dream" and "Conquistadora."
It's been 26 years since "When I Was Puerto Rican" was published but the memoir is more vital than ever. After two hurricanes devastated the island in 2017, the people of Puerto Rico are dealing with crushing poverty and an administration that disputes the island's need for more aid. But Santiago demonstrates the resilience of Puerto Rican people, even in the face of unforeseeable obstacles.
In one scene, Santiago's family steps out right when the eye of a hurricane passes them to see a rainbow in the sky: "The women pointed and held up the smaller children to see, while those of us big enough to stand by ourselves crowded the door in awe of that magic spectacle: the figures of our fathers and brothers moving cautiously in a world with no edges, no end, and that bright slice of sun traveling across it, not once touching them."
It is this sort of beautiful prose, both heartbreaking and joyful, and the unforgettable character of Mami that solidifies Santiago's place alongside other great authors adept in capturing setting and creating characters who transcend their books' pages: Horatio Alger, Jamaica Kincaid and Frank McCourt, for instance. "When I Was Puerto Rican" appeared in my life when I craved a connection to my family and their history, and it delivers a powerful American story.
Esmeralda Santiago: A Starter Kit
'A PUERTO RICAN STEW '
In this essay, published in The New York Times in 1994, Santiago explores her complicated relationship to her cultural identity through the seemingly mundane act of cooking with her mother. It foreshadows the style of her future memoirs.
'ALMOST A WOMAN'
Santiago picks up where she left off in "When I was a Puerto Rican" with another memoir, this time following a teenage Santiago's rebellions against her mother's rigid rules.
'CONQUISTADORA'
It is in this sprawling historical novel, set in Puerto Rico in the 19th century, that Santiago truly shines. Santiago uses historically rich details to draw a portrait of a protagonist, Ana Cubillas, who is strong-willed and unforgettable.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lenny Dykstra's libel and defamation lawsuit against one-time New York Mets teammate Ron Darling, St. Martin's Press and Macmillan Publishing Group over a passage in the pitcher's new book is the latest court battle involving the former All-Star outfielder.
Dykstra, sentenced seven years ago to prison on both federal and California state charges, filed suit Tuesday in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress for Darling writing that the player, fondly known as "Nails," directed racist comments toward Boston pitcher Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd during the 1986 World Series.
The lawsuit charges that Darling "has sought to capitalize on (Dykstra's) complicated past" and maliciously portrayed him as a racist, "an irremovable stain and permanent cloud which will forever diminish Mr. Dykstra, stalk him and preclude him from unknowable professional and personal relationship."
Dykstra's lawsuit calls Darling's account a "fictional portrayal" and "false and self-serving."
The lawsuit also quotes Boyd denying any knowledge of Darling's account.
"No such racist tirade ever occurred," the lawsuit says, adding that Darling had "a strategy of sensationalizing and shocking his audience, at the expense of no less than Mr. Dykstra."
The lawsuit accuses Darling "clearly stretched and exceeded the bounds of reality in contriving this latest work."
Dykstra, who lives in Linden, is no stranger to the court system, having been sentenced seven years ago to prison on both federal and California state charges.
In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California filed for the garnishment of Dykstra's earnings from his own memoir, "House of Nails," which briefly appeared on the New York Times nonfiction Best-Seller List. The garnishment sought $153,175.02 in restitution after he was found guilty of bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to six months in prison.
In 2017, Dykstra agreed in an out-of-court settlement to pay Noah Scheinmann $15,000 to manage his social media presence and to serve as the ghost writer for his Twitter account. Scheinmann charged in the federal lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York that Dykstra did not pay him for his services.
In Septeember 2018, Dykstra filed a lawsuit transferred from the Supreme Court of New York to the Southern District of New York against DLP Media Group, claiming a breach of contract in a deal for the production of a documentary based on his life. That suit was settled out of court in November.
In January, Dykstra filed a federal lawsuit against 6069321 Canada Inc. for breach of contract for not paying him to serve as a "brand ambassador" for Rebound Finance, "where Americans with low or poor credit could learn about and shop for credit products."
Dykstara's lawsuit, which calls himself a "beloved retired baseball player who is widely admired for his mental toughness, positive energy, loyalty and tenacity," is still pending.
Last week Dykstra pleaded guilty in Linden Municipal Court to three zoning summons and a housing summons related to running an illegal rooming house in his one-family Stockton Circle home. He was fined $2,500.
The resolution of the housing violations comes less than a month after Dykstra pleaded guilty to a petty disorderly persons offense in connection with an argument with an Uber driver in Linden.

Darling's "108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns, and the Darndest Characters from My Time in the Game" was published April 2 by St. Martin's Press, which is part of Macmillan.
Darling wrote Dykstra was "one of baseball's all-time thugs" and was in the on-deck circle at Boston's Fenway Park before Game 3 of the 1986 World Series while Boyd warmed up "shouting every imaginable and unimaginable insult and expletive in his direction — foul, racist, hateful, hurtful stuff." Darling went on to call it "the worst collection of taunts and insults I'd ever heard — worse, I'm betting, than anything Jackie Robinson might have heard, his first couple times around the league."
Darling, a 58-year-old SNY broadcaster, declined comment before the Mets' game against Minnesota on Tuesday night. Tracey Guest of St. Martin's Press did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Texto completo: Other Voices
"What's my name?"
These three words have the power to save lives and must become as automatic to every college student getting into a ride-hailing vehicle as putting on a seat belt. The policy would probably be worthwhile for anyone who uses ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft, but I have a particular, and urgent, reason to try to persuade college students to make "What's my name?" a habit.
Samantha Josephson, a student at the University of South Carolina, where I am president, was buried last week, the victim of a senseless crime that tears at the heart of every parent and has shaken me and our university family. The death of any student is hard to comprehend, but that is especially true of Samantha, a 21-year-old senior who was majoring in political science, eager to commit herself to helping change the world.
According to police here in Columbia, South Carolina, Samantha ordered an Uber to pick her up at 2 a.m. on March 29 in the Five Points district, a nightlife area near campus, and mistakenly got into a black Chevrolet Impala, thinking it was her ride. A heartbreaking surveillance video released by law enforcement officials shows the vehicle pulling up beside her as people walk past; Samantha opens the door, slips into the back seat and closes the door. The same scene, of trusting young people getting into ride-hailing vehicles, no doubt played out countless times near college campuses early that Friday morning all over America.
Later that day, hunters found Samantha's body, about 70 miles away in rural South Carolina. Police said she had been stabbed to death. They soon made an arrest, charging the suspect with murder and kidnapping.
What happened to Samantha was not the first time that someone has mistaken a vehicle for a ride-hailing pickup and then been attacked by a driver who seemed to be prowling for victims. The New York Times on April 4 reported on "a rash of kidnappings, sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as ride-share drivers." Publicly reported cases indicate that there have been "at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years," the paper said.
In South Carolina, lawmakers have introduced the Samantha Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act, which would require ride-hailing drivers to display illuminated signs when their vehicles are in service and to turn off the sign when off-duty. Any steps to improve safety are welcome, but illuminated signs for ride-hailing companies can be easily purchased online.
In recent days, I've heard from many students, public-safety officials and parents, including Samantha's own family, about the importance of ride-hailing safety. We have discussed many ways to improve the transportation options for students, including traveling in groups on nights out.
For ride-hailing safety, students should first ensure that the license plate, make, model and color of the vehicle match the details provided by the app used to hail the ride. But I think one of the best safety measures of all would be for customers, every time they use a ride-hailing service, to stop before entering the vehicle and ask the driver plainly: What's my name? A legitimate driver will have that information; someone with criminal intent will not.
As a college president for more than a decade, I recognize that the exuberant and trusting nature of our students - characteristics that make them such wonderful people - also makes them vulnerable targets for those who seek to do harm. On campuses across the country, administrators have put great effort into safety programs, including education about drugs and alcohol. Ride-hailing safety information is a new frontier, but I urge my fellow administrators to devise a program and put it into practice as soon as possible.
The country has witnessed the power and effectiveness of other public-health and safety campaigns, such as those regarding smoking and the use of seat belts. The campaigns work and have saved countless lives. A new safety campaign - and not just for college students - is needed as ride-hailing gains in popularity. We owe it to Samantha Josephson.

Texto completo: Lenny Dykstra's lawsuit calls Darling's account a "fictional portrayal" and "false and self-serving." The lawsuit accuses Darling "clearly stretched and exceeded the bounds of reality in contriving this latest work."
NEW YORK - Lenny Dykstra's libel and defamation lawsuit against one-time New York Mets teammate Ron Darling, St. Martin's Press and Macmillan Publishing Group over a passage in the pitcher's new book is the latest court battle involving the former All-Star outfielder.
Dykstra, sentenced seven years ago to prison on both federal and California state charges, filed suit Tuesday in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress for Darling writing that the player, fondly known as "Nails," directed racist comments toward Boston pitcher Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd during the 1986 World Series.
The lawsuit charges that Darling "has sought to capitalize on (Dykstra's) complicated past" and maliciously portrayed him as a racist, "an irremovable stain and permanent cloud which will forever diminish Mr. Dykstra, stalk him and preclude him from unknowable professional and personal relationship."
Dykstra's lawsuit calls Darling's account a "fictional portrayal" and "false and self-serving."
The lawsuit also quotes Boyd denying any knowledge of Darling's account.
"No such racist tirade ever occurred," the lawsuit says, adding that Darling had "a strategy of sensationalizing and shocking his audience, at the expense of no less than Mr. Dykstra."
The lawsuit accuses Darling "clearly stretched and exceeded the bounds of reality in contriving this latest work."

Singer/Songwriter Joe Jackson plays the Southern May 4 COLUMBUS - Best-known for his hits "Is She Really Going Out with Him?," "Steppin' Out," and "You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)," singer/songwriter Joe Jackson celebrates a 40-year-long career with a tour that draws from five of his albums—Look Sharp (1979,) Night and Day (1982), Laughter and Lust (1991), Rain (2008), and Fool (2019)—and throws in a few other songs from other albums and new covers.
CAPA presents Joe Jackson at the Southern Theatre (21 E. Main St.) at 8 p.m. Saturday, May 4. Tickets are $45-$60 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 745-3000.
Born in England, Jackson joined a school violin class at age 11 to escape the humiliation of playing sports. Much to his own surprise, he found himself fascinated by music and eagerly studying music theory and history.
At age 16, Jackson played his first paying gig, as pianist in a pub next door to a glue factory just outside of Portsmouth. This was followed by other pub gigs and accompanying a bouzouki player in a Greek restaurant. At 18, he won a scholarship to study composition, piano, and percussion at London's Royal Academy of Music. By the time he left the Academy, he was the co-leader and songwriter of Arms and Legs, a proto-punk outfit which released two singles before burning out.
By 1978, Jackson was living in London and hawking an album-length demo, Look Sharp, found its way to American producer David Kershenbaum and he was signed to A&M Records. He re-recorded Look Sharp, began to play regular gigs, and released the album in 1979.
Look Sharp (containing the hit "Is She Really Going Out with Him") was followed within a year by the very similar I'm The Man (containing the hit "It's Different for Girls") and in 1980 by the darker, more reggae-influenced Beat Crazy.
In 2006, Jackson did a short trio tour with Graham Maby and Dave Houghton. He moved to Berlin, where he recorded Rain (2007). The trio toured for the next three years, and played more shows than any other Jackson lineup. A live album, Live Music, was released in 2011.
The second decade of the century saw the release of The Duke, a cover album of Duke Ellington compositions, but radically different from the originals. Fast Forward (2015) features four sets of four songs recorded in four different cities – New York, New Orleans, Berlin and Amsterdam – each with a different set of guest musicians.
Fool was released in January 2019 – exactly 40 years after the release of Look Sharp. A much shorter and more focused album than Fast Forward, with a much more 'live' feel, it was recorded at the end of a tour in a week and a half with the band Jackson has been working with for the last three years—Graham Maby (bass), Teddy Kumpel (guitar), and Doug Yowell (drums).

Texto completo: A few days ago, the artist Andres Serrano was making final choices for "The Game: All Things Trump," his installation of 1,000 items marketed, branded, or autographed by the current president that opens Friday in Manhattan's Meatpacking District.
It is a museum-grade project, with quality frames, custom vitrines, careful lighting. It covers two floors, with a mezzanine bar that will operate during the two-month run, an heirloom from a lineage of nightclubs, including Lotus, that once occupied this space on West 14th Street. Near the bar, Mr. Serrano had set up a blackjack table rescued from the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City; boxing jackets from big-ticket bouts, and a case of colognes ("Success by Trump").
The issue was with the mannequins. Each wore Trump Taj Mahal security guard uniforms (authentic) and a Make America Great Again cap. There were 11, standing on either side of a very large print of Mr. Serrano's photograph of Donald Trump (made in 2004 as part of the artist's "America" portrait series) that dominated the back wall. Someone had lifted the right arms of the mannequins in a wave, or salute, and the question was whether they should stay that way.
Huddled with his wife, Irina, and the head of the installation team, Mr. Serrano invited this reporter to advise. What first came to mind was, well, the Nazi salute, but the arm positions -- too high, too loose -- weren't right.
"It could be Hail to the Chief," Mr. Serrano observed.
Salute or not, the mannequins gave off a distinct militia energy. Either way, I ventured, both friends and foes of the president would find substance for debate.
"And people who want to hate me or love me will also find a story," Mr. Serrano said. He decided to lower the arms. Keep it neutral.
Signs and wonders: Mr. Serrano, of all people, shying from controversy.
This is the artist whose "Piss Christ," his infamous image of a plastic crucifix bathed in urine, sparked the first skirmish in the culture wars 30 years ago. On May 17, 1989, after the work's presence in an exhibition drew national attention, an apoplectic Sen. Al D'Amato tore up the catalog on the Senate floor.
The fracas over Robert Mapplethorpe's planned, then banned, Corcoran Gallery show followed almost immediately. It led to the first Congressional proposal to defund the National Endowment for the Arts -- a move that Mr. Trump's budget proposals have again put on the table.
In later photography series, Mr. Serrano focused on Ku Klux Klan members in their robes, cadavers in a morgue, and close-up images of human (his own) and animal feces. Mr. Serrano's most recent New York show, in Fall 2017 at Jack Shainman Gallery, was titled "Torture." It depicted antique torture instruments, stylized poses of bodies in torment, and portraits of survivors from Sudan and Northern Ireland.
Now, with Mr. Trump in his sights, Mr. Serrano is playing it coy.
"Donald Trump is all things to all people," he told me in his Greenwich Village apartment recently, under the gaze of his ample collection of European church statues from the medieval to the Baroque periods.
"I make art about very basic things: life, death, religion," he said. "After a while it occurred to me, what's the most important thing right now? Donald Trump."
That epiphany, about a year ago, sent Mr. Serrano on a mission, which he conducted largely on eBay, spending long hours locating and then bidding on Trumpiana.
His efforts turned up gold-coated bottles of Trump Vodka, boxes used to package Trump Steaks, and a fake dollar bill showing Hillary Clinton behind bars.
Mr. Serrano found a legal document pertaining to financing of Mr. Trump's casinos. He procured a 10-foot sign from the Trump Taj Mahal's Ego Lounge, the letters E-G-O rotating on a pedestal.
He calls the venture, his first ever installation project, a portrait. Some viewers may experience it as a demented trip down memory lane. Dredged back to the surface are characters like Marla Maples, Mr. Trump's second wife, who appears by his side in the Tarzan-and-Jane composition of a party invitation poster from 1994 (celebrating the "Lord of the Financial Jungle") and announces on a 1990 New York Post cover the "BEST SEX I EVER HAD!"
Mr. Serrano said he'd love it if the president saw the project. He has bought short advertising slots on a spectrum of cable shows -- Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon, Morning Joe -- to run a 15-second video teasing the installation.
It's a lot of effort, and expense. Mr. Serrano spent close to $200,000 on the objects. But to what end?
"He's a fighter," he said. "He's good with words, especially insults. He's sharp on his toes, in a way that's part of being a New Yorker."
From Mr. Serrano, a New Yorker and, at age 68, just four years younger than the president, it sounded like a compliment.
"It's possible that Donald Trump expresses a lot of things that many people might feel but don't express," Mr. Serrano said. "Racism? It's an issue. And sexism, misogyny, they're all issues concerning Donald Trump."
I gave the show a chance. I didn't hate it. At points it feels like it's about to present an argument. The vitrine of Trump University material, with someone's real diploma amid the workbooks and videos promising wealth through trading in foreclosures, is haunting: the human pain and exploitation intrudes here.
Elsewhere, it's a fun house. But the boxes of "Trump: The Game," a Monopoly-like product with the tagline, "It's not whether you win or lose ... It's whether you win," on their own do little to advance what we have come to know about our present situation.
Mr. Serrano's project is hosted by ArtX, a new private club. Like "Torture" before it, it is backed by a/political, an arts initiative based in London and financed by Andrei Tretyakov, a technology entrepreneur. It is working with a roster of artists with brash ideas, like Santiago Sierra, who recently put up for sale a sculpture of King Felipe of Spain on the condition that the buyer burn it, and Andrey Molodkin, whose latest project asks visitors to donate blood that, pumped into a machine, activates an audiovisual installation.
By that standard, Mr. Serrano's composite Trump portrait seems tame.
But had he gunned for outrage, he would probably have fallen short; by now Mr. Trump's reign is itself the provocation. Mr. Serrano's installation reminds us how relentlessly the president made his legend, but it rings mostly nostalgic, a throwback to times when the poison was merely latent.
Of course, it was never just that. Also 30 years ago, on May 1, 1989, Mr. Trump was running his full-page advertisement in The New York Times, The New York Post, The New York Daily News, and New York Newsday, demanding the death penalty for the Central Park Five, since exonerated -- a position he has never disavowed.
That particular Trump-signed artifact does not appear in Mr. Serrano's installation. The artist conceded that it never hit his radar at the time.
"I wasn't aware of his attitude about those young men," he said. "He was a celebrity, a playboy, a businessman, but I really wasn't paying attention to what he was saying."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren raised $6 million in her first three months as a presidential candidate, her campaign announced Wednesday, a total that falls short of several Democratic newcomers as she tries to stand out in a crowded field by swearing off some common funding tactics.
The senator's $6 million haul from 135,000 donors puts her near the back of the pack of top-tier Democratic candidates but is enough to keep her extensive operation afloat — a development that probably will ease the concerns of some allies who worried her first-quarter totals would be dismal after she decided to forgo courting wealthy donors.
About 99 percent of contributions to Warren were for less than $200, demonstrating the breadth of her support among small donors. But she trails the leader among Democrats, Senator Bernie Sanders, who raised $18.2 million in the first quarter.
In a bright spot for her campaign, Warren gained considerable fund-raising momentum as the quarter wore on. She raised $1.4 million in the last week of March alone, after her campaign warned supporters in numerous e-mails she was being outraised by other candidates. The figure was nearly 25 percent of her total over the three-month period that began Jan. 1.
And the Massachusetts Democrat saw a spike in donations on the day she announced she was swearing off large dollar fund-raisers in February, suggesting to campaign officials that grass-roots progressives are responding to her strategy. Warren has more time to travel to unconventional primary states such as Mississippi and keep up a grueling campaign pace because she's not on the fancy fund-raising circuit, her aides argue.
“Because Elizabeth's been able to count on grassroots donations, she's been able to spend her time visiting as many states as possible, meeting voters, and calling grassroots donors to personally thank them for giving," Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau wrote to supporters in an e-mail announcing the total. Her adviser Joe Rospars, an Obama veteran, put it this way on Twitter: “Time is worth more than money."
Still, for a candidate who entered the 2020 race on Dec. 31 with high expectations, the total is a sign that it could be difficult for her to stay competitive in the money chase while relying solely on small-dollar donors. She burned through $5 million in three months, but still has $11 million cash on hand due to the hefty war chest she had going in as a candidate.
Warren raised more than Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, who pulled in about $5 million each. But she lagged behind less-established candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, the once little-known mayor of South Bend, Ind., who reported $7 million in contributions in his first quarter as a candidate; former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke, who pulled in $9.4 million; and Senator Kamala Harris of California, who raised $12 million.
Without directly naming Harris or O'Rourke, Lau suggested in his e-mail to supporters that those candidates are overly reliant on wealthy donors. “One of the other candidates who had more or less the same number of donations raised 55% more money because of big-dollar contributions," Lau wrote, in a veiled reference to O'Rourke's $9.4 million total.
Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg all reported having around the same number of total donors to their campaigns, but Warren's average donation size was much lower than theirs at only $28. This suggests she raised less than them because she received fewer big contributions from wealthy donors. Based on the limited information that candidates have shared so far, only Sanders has a lower average donation rate than Warren among the top-tier candidates, at $20.
Early fund-raising is just one measure of momentum, and the candidate with the most money in the bank is not necessarily the one with the most supporters. But Warren's fund-raising total casts some doubt on the wisdom of her decision to do away with the hybrid model of fund-raising she had mastered as a senator. For seven years, Warren brought in cash online with fiery appeals to the left's small donor base as well as by hosting wealthy contributors in her Cambridge home and at restaurants in events that cost thousands of dollars just to walk through the door.
That model built her a reputation as a fund-raising juggernaut and heightened expectations for her as a presidential candidate. She raised $42.5 million for her first election in 2012, and another $35 million between then and her reelection bid last year.
“I remember times where she would go on Rachel Maddow on an issue around the campaign — we'd send an e-mail out and we'd raise 2, 3, or $400,000 just from that appearance," Doug Rubin, a top adviser to Warren's 2012 campaign, told the Globe last month.
But in February, Warren announced she would no longer hold private fund-raisers or call wealthy people asking for donations. The new limitations came on top of her pledge not to take money from any political action committees or accept help from super PACs, which can pull in unlimited contributions. That vow alienated her longtime finance director, Michael Pratt, who is leaving the campaign, a development first reported by The New York Times.
Still, making a bet to rely solely on online fund-raising is risky, especially given that there were signs Warren's star power as an online fund-raiser was fading before she decided to run for president. For years, Warren was a sought-after surrogate who helped Democrats around the country bring in campaign cash, and she socked away a cool $11 million for her own presidential run before she declared.
But by the 2018 midterms, she was competing with newer faces in the party who were out-performing her online. One adviser to a 2018 Senate candidate who requested anonymity to talk freely said Warren's e-mails on that candidate's behalf would bring in only about half as much money as e-mails sent by Harris. In the first quarter, Harris pulled in about $6 million from her online donor base and another $6 million in part from the kinds of fund-raisers that Warren has sworn off.
Warren has the campaign infrastructure of a front-runner, with 80 staffers in the four states with early contests and about 170 people on staff total, according to an aide. Veterans of presidential politics estimate it could take $100 million for a candidate to get through the four early states alone before confronting primaries in the giant states of California and Texas, where pricey advertising becomes more important to reach voters.
“Here's the problem: The new map of having California and Texas so early means money is going to be even more important in the Democratic primary, unfortunately," said Jim Messina, who was Barack Obama's campaign manager for his 2012 run. “And Senator Warren just decided to get rid of half of her fund-raising ability."
Yet those who have watched Warren's career closely say not to count her out.
“You don't have to outraise people, you just have to be competitive," said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based political consultant. “The real test is the next quarter."

Texto completo: Allison Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville” sobre Superman, se declaró ayer culpable de crimen organizado en el caso de la secta Nxivm, cuyos dirigentes están acusados de tráfico y esclavitud sexual en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y de conspiración, pero aún tienen pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
“He llegado a la conclusión de que debo asumir toda la responsabilidad sobre mi conducta y es por eso que me declaro culpable hoy”, dijo la actriz, citada por el medio Hollywoodlife.
Mack se encontraba en libertad condicional desde el año pasado, así como Clare Bronfman (40), una de las herederas del conglomerado de licores tradicionalmente conocido como Seagram’s.
El supuesto líder del grupo, Keith Raniere (58), es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Mack también pidió perdón a su familia y a todas aquellas personas que hirió por su “adherencia equivocada a las enseñanzas de Keith Reniere”, líder de la secta, reseñó EFE.
Según la fiscalía, la actriz recibió beneficios financieros a cambio de reclutar esclavas sexuales para Reniere.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación.
Otras acusadas son su hija Lauren Salzman y Kathy Russel.
Según la acusación, Nxivm formaba parte de un entramado piramidal formado por varias entidades. Entre los crímenes de los que se les acusan están “robo de identidad, extorsión, trabajos forzados, tráfico sexual, lavado de dinero, fraude y obstrucción a la justicia”.
Raniere exigía a su círculo cercano una lealtad absoluta.
Raniere llevaba dos décadas impulsando supuestos programas de autoayuda bajo la empresa paraguas Nxivm, de la que era fundador y que abarcaba centros operativos en Estados Unidos, México, Canadá y varios países de Suramérica.
En el año 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes” o “El voto”, donde era el único hombre y el líder, mientras que Mack era “una de las mujeres en el primer nivel de la pirámide, inmediatamente después” de él.
DOS operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”, y se esperaba de estas últimas que reclutaran a otras nuevas.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Chinese woman arrested at Mar-a-Lago had hidden camera detector, prosecutors say

Texto completo: The Chinese woman who was arrested after gaining entry to President Trump's private club while carrying four cellphones and other electronic equipment had even more electronics in her hotel room, including a device used to detect hidden cameras, a federal prosecutor said Monday.
The woman, Yujing Zhang, who was born in 1986, was arrested March 30 after telling Secret Service agents that she had come to use the pool at Mar-a-Lago and showing two Chinese passports. After authorities determined that the event she said she had come to attend did not exist, she was arrested and charged with lying to a federal officer and accessing a restricted area.
Zhang had entered the property with four cellphones, a hard drive, and a thumb drive infected with malware, according to federal court records. Upon searching her hotel room, investigators found another cellphone and a radio frequency device that detects hidden cameras, Assistant US Attorney Rolando Garcia said during a bond hearing at the US District Court in West Palm Beach on Monday.
She also had nine USB drives and five SIM cards in her room at the Colony Hotel, along with several debit cards and about $8,000 in cash, including about $700 in Chinese currency, Garcia said.
Garcia told US Magistrate Judge William Matthewman that Zhang is a “serious flight risk" because she “lies to everyone that she encounters."
She had initially told authorities at the club that she carried multiple phones to the resort because she was afraid to leave them in her hotel room, Garcia said. She had previously told the court in an appearance last week that she had only about $5,000 in the bank.
Zhang came to the United States on March 28 from Shanghai on a B-1 visa that has been revoked, meaning that if the court does release her from jail pending trial, she would be transferred to immigration custody, Garcia said.
Zhang's assistant federal public defender, Robert Adler, said in the court hearing that Zhang did not attempt to hide the four cellphones when she entered the club. He stressed to the judge that she is not charged with espionage.
The Secret Service agent who questioned Zhang after her arrest, Samuel Ivanovich, said during testimony that she did not carry any lock-picking or eavesdropping gear. His 4½-hour interrogation of Zhang was recorded by video, Ivanovich said, but it lacked sound because he didn't realize that the agency's office in Palm Beach didn't have that capability.
The judge postponed a decision on whether to release her on bond until next week, to give the defense time to bring people from China who could support Zhang's story.

Top Judiciary Republican urges Mueller testimony
The top-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee is urging that special counsel Robert Mueller be called to testify before the panel this month.
Representative Douglas Collins, R-Ga., in a letter Monday to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said that he would like to see Mueller testify during the week of April 22, calling it "undoubtedly the best way" for the American people to learn about "the full contours" of the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.
Last week, the Democrat-led committee voted to authorize Nadler to subpoena the full report and underlying documents produced by Mueller during his investigation into whether the Trump campaign and Russia coordinated during the presidential election and whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe.
According to a four-page summary of top-line findings of Mueller's report provided to Congress by Attorney General William Barr, Trump and his campaign did not illegally coordinate with Russia, but Mueller left open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he concluded that Trump did not commit obstruction.
Nadler went on Twitter later Monday to say he agrees that Mueller should appear before the committee but that the committee needs to see the full report and hear from Barr first in order "to ask Special Counsel Mueller the right questions."
"We look forward to hearing from Mr. Mueller at the appropriate time," Nadler said.
Nadler is seeking to bring Barr before the committee to explain his conclusions but has not ruled out calling Mueller later. Democrats are increasingly questioning whether Barr, a Trump appointee, was a neutral arbiter on what transpired.

Maine woman charged with sending letter to Collins
A Maine woman appeared in court on Monday to face federal charges of mailing a threatening letter to the home of US Senator Susan Collins last year.
An affidavit filed in US District Court in Bangor said Suzanne Muscara, 37, of Burlington, mailed starch to the Republican senator's Bangor home along with a note reading: "AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!" The letter also included a threatening drawing of a stick figure with the letter X for eyes and an arrow pointing at its face.
The mail was intercepted at a postal mail sorting facility in Hampden, Maine, triggering an investigation. Muscara was arrested Friday.
According to court documents, Muscara told federal authorities she thought law enforcement would catch the letter before it reached Collins's home and that it wouldn't be taken seriously, WABI-TV reported. It was not clear whether Muscara had a lawyer who could comment on her behalf.
The mailing came after Collins cast a key vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and shortly after she received another threatening letter at home that was addressed to her husband.
Muscara is expected to return to court next week. She faces up to 10 years in prison.

Trump resists Democrats' push for report, tax returns
President Trump went on Twitter Monday morning to cite recent comments from conservative lawmakers and pundits as he continued to air grievances about efforts of congressional Democrats to obtain the full special counsel report and his tax returns.
In a series of tweets, Trump — who until recently had said he had no problem with the release of the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election — cited the views of commentators questioning whether Democrats should have access to it and claiming that they were trying to weaken Trump politically.
In one tweet, Trump quoted Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall.com, saying that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was "not entitled" to the full report and underlying documents produced by Mueller, who investigated whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in 2016 and whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe.
In another tweet Monday, Trump quoted Charles Hurt, the opinion editor of the Washington Times, saying Democrats "made up this complete lie about Collusion."
"The Russian Hoax never happened, it was a fraud on the American people!" Trump added in his own words.
The president also pushed back against efforts by the Democratic-led Ways and Means Committee to obtain six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service.
In one instance, Trump retweeted Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a frequent ally and the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, saying that "Dems want President's tax returns for purely political purposes!"
Trump also tweeted a C-SPAN clip in which Jordan defended Trump's pledge to fight releasing his tax returns during an interview.
Trump's tweets Monday came a day after his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that Democrats will "never" see the president's tax returns, abandoning Trump's long-held position that he would someday release the documents for public inspection.

Texto completo: Michael J. Smit, a nurse practitioner at Sinai Hospital, died April 1 from complications of influenza and pneumonia. He was 53.
A Baltimore County native and Roland Park resident, Mr. Smit worked in a number of roles at Sinai Hospital, including positions in the intensive care unit, in bariatric surgery care and later running the hospital's hepatitis C treatment clinic.
"Mike was a caregiver; he loved taking care of people. He wanted to be a nurse because he really loved the hands-on part of it, and he got in there with people. He was very compassionate, he was very real and honest with people, and they responded to it," his husband, Dr. Chris Beyrer, said. "His patients knew that he had their back."
Dr. Sudhir Dutta, Mr. Smit's supervisor and a gastroenterologist, worked with Mr. Smit for years, and remembered him for his rapport with patients.
"All the patients were very happy with him because that was his style - he was a very loving guy, a very caring guy and very honest," Dr. Dutta said. "I don't have the ability to communicate with patients in the way that Mike did. He got down on their level."
Outside the hospital, Mr. Smit was active in local gay sports leagues, an avid traveler and a "ruthless" word puzzler. He helped found a gay bowling league - the Charm City Kings & Queens - and bowled Monday nights. After 12 years in the league, he bowled his first 200 weeks before he got sick, friend and bowling partner Robert Fahey said.
He said Mr. Smit always presented a positive attitude.
"In the lull of the conversation, Mike would just say, 'Living the dream,'" Mr. Fahey said.
Mr. Smit and Dr. Beyrer enjoyed traveling to far-flung destinations - from London to Italy to South Africa. They went on four safaris together, most recently in South Africa in December 2017, Dr. Beyrer said.
"There's nothing he enjoyed more in life than sitting quietly in a family herd of elephants," Dr. Beyrer said. "He just loved them and was very into their peace and depth."
Mr. Smit's interest in history - particularly his obsession with British royals - took them to London. Before his death, Mr. Smit was reading a biography of Mary, Queen of Scots, and he once spent hours in line waiting to see her grave.
A little royal family trivia helped seal the connection between Mr. Smit and Dr. Beyrer on the night they met. Dr. Beyrer remembered locking eyes with his future husband from across the bar at Mount Vernon's now-shuttered Club Hippo, where they were attending a Baltimore Pride festival after-party.
"He walked over to me and he said, 'You look like the smartest man in the room,'" Dr. Beyrer said. "He would only give his phone number if I could name the six wives of Henry VIII ... I only got four right."
But four out of six was enough to start their 22-year relationship. Shortly after gay marriage was legalized in Maryland, the couple wed on April 12, 2013.
On their wedding day, Dr. Beyrer recalled Mr. Smit was the only one in their small party at the courthouse who wasn't crying.
"He looked right at me and said, "Why would I be crying? This was the happiest, proudest day of my life,' " Dr. Beyrer said. "Our marriage meant a lot to other LGBT people, sort of thinking and looking at what ... a life with dignity and rights could be about."
The couple enjoyed hosting social gatherings.
When he wasn't playing tennis on Sundays, Mr. Smit would complete the New York Times crossword puzzle (in ink). He had a way with word games, Dr. Beyrer said.
"He played Scrabble as though it was poker," Dr. Beyrer said. "He was ruthless and very, very good at it."
Mr. Smit also enjoyed live music and theater, and he held a devotion to the "great divas," Dr. Beyrer said. Mr. Fahey traveled with the couple to shows on what he called their "dying divas tour." They saw acts like Barbra Streisand, Reba McEntire, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, Loretta Lynn and Carol Burnett, Dr. Beyrer said.
For their 20th anniversary, Mr. Smit bought tickets to see Bette Midler in "Hello Dolly."
"It was all a part of his loving life and really living for it and going for it," Dr. Beyrer said.
A Dundalk High School graduate, Mr. Smit received a bachelor's degree from Towson University and a master's degree from the University of Maryland School of Nursing.
The family held private services last week.
In addition to his husband, Mr. Smit is survived by his parents, Esther Smit and John Smit Jr.; sister Donna Smit; and six nieces and nephews.

Plan a careful budget, then get ready to splurge

Texto completo: During a 10-day tour of India, Farryn Truen sketched out an ambitious itinerary to visit Delhi, Jaipur, Ranthambore National Park, Alwar and Agra that included a big-ticket item: She and her now-husband, Jake, hired a private driver for their trip.
Paying for that meant forgoing activities - there was no hot air balloon ride in Jaipur - and downgrading to budget-friendly hotels for part of the trip.
But it's the go-to travel splurge for Truen, 33, a New York-based brand consultant and frequent traveler: a way to see more of the place she is visiting at her own pace, make local connections and avoid all the wasted time spent traveling to, from and in airports.
"My husband and I have this joke that we've had some of our favorite meals at rest stops because you get to see real life," Truen said. "Immersing myself in a place is the ultimate luxury."
Among seasoned travelers, selective splurging - picking the one thing they'll spend big on, while saving everywhere else - is a common strategy for getting the most out of a trip.
The additional spend doesn't have to be sizable; it can be several thousand on a nice hotel room - or a hundred dollars or less on a local experience. It's about mindfully choosing to allocate a little extra on one part of the trip to make it easier, more memorable or more engaging.
The indulgences can be directed at any step of the adventure: hotel, excursions, a particularly unforgettable meal. For some, practical upgrades - a nonstop flight, a nicer rental car - make all the difference. Chris Jackson, a London-based photographer for Getty Images, recommends a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones. "They make a massive difference," Jackson said of his Bose Quietcomfort 35 II pair ($349.95). He often doesn't even play music on them, preferring to just drown out other passengers.
Elaine Welteroth, an author and the former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, always hunts for a fabulous vintage souvenir. The 32-year-old's closet is home to a few 40s-style dresses from a shop in Amsterdam that cost about $60 apiece and a Calvin Klein Collection faux fur coat that she "spent way too much on" in New Orleans. "Every item is totally unique to that place and time in my life," she said.
Strategic luxury can be a way of splurging and saving at the same time. Actress, author and talk show host Busy Philipps doesn't always travel on a budget, but when she does, she makes finding the perfect resort her focus, then economizes on the room. "We will rent the cheapest room in the nicest hotel," she said. "I don't mind, on vacation, being cramped."
Last year, she and her family stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita in Mexico. The family of four squeezed into one of the hotel's standard rooms (which can range from $450 to $2,200 a night, depending on the season, according to the hotel) with her two daughters sleeping on a pull-out couch.
While the same money would have bought a bigger room at a less luxurious resort, it wouldn't have given them access to the same pristine beaches and infinity-edge pool. And springing for a one-bedroom at Punta Mita would have cost twice what they paid. (She also recommends a beach-side massage, which provides a relaxing indulgence without sacrificing lounging time.) . In the United States, spending on travel, which includes transportation, lodging and tourist attractions, was expected to reach an estimated $580 billion in 2018, an increase of 23 percent from 2013, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.
Travelers tend to splurge most on where they are headed: More than 8 in 10 respondents in the 2017 U.S. Family Travel Survey said they would splurge on the destination. The study, conducted by the Family Travel Association and the Tisch Center for Hospitality at New York University's School of Professional Studies, surveyed 1,599 people, each representing one family.
Roughly 6 in 10 will splurge on accommodations and meals out.
Buying yourself time can lead to greater happiness, but it is something many people are reluctant to do.
Ashley Muir Bruhn, who lives in Davis, California, recommends paying extra for a direct flight. The mother of two and author of the blog Hither & Thither argues that whatever money you save on connecting flights is negated by the added risks. Missing your next flight or losing your bags is a terrific way to ruin a trip. Two shorter legs could mean less in-flight service, and how much more would you pay for those extra hours at the pool where you are headed?
Plus, there is the mental toll, especially with children (hers are ages 5 and 7). By booking connecting flights, "you've made your whole travel time - the not-fun part - so much longer," Muir Bruhn, 40, said.
Her family takes two to three major trips a year and will go out of their way to get a direct flight. Instead of flying out of Sacramento, the closest airport, she will travel to Oakland or even San Francisco in order to fly nonstop.
Patrick Janelle, whose food-and-travel-focused Instagram account @ aguynamedpatrick boasts 439,000 followers, splurges on upgrading his rental car. "With just a little extra spending, you can make a really significant part of your travel that much more comfortable," he said.
Janelle, a 37-year-old New Yorker, once rented a Volvo SUV in Los Angeles via Sixt Rent, a German-based company that offers up-market cars. It was about $360 for four days, Janelle says, and he planned his day around conference calls on the go.
In Europe, Janelle prefers to rent scooters. The pristine, royal blue Vespa he rented in Cannes, spending about $280 dollars for three days, made for the perfect backdrop for one of his Instagram posts. "I'm often thinking about what details in my life in general are photo-worthy," Janelle said, "or what I can do to make them photo-worthy"
Lodging is a much more common splurge, whether on a carefully situated (and decorated) AirBnb or a fourstar hotel. "I want to wake up in a place that brings me joy," said Ukonwa Ojo, a New York-based marketing executive. "I'm inelastic when it comes to cost on that."
She researches heavily before booking, reading reviews everywhere she can find them and making sure the accommodations are known for their high-touch service.
Her stays have ranged from a room with a sea view at the Sofitel Bahrain that won't break the bank (up to $320 a night, according to the hotel) to the Zen grand experience at the all-inclusive Grand Velas Riviera Maya in Mexico (starting at $434 per person based on double occupancy).
Ojo remembers her stay at the Taj Exotica in the Maldives, in a deluxe lagoon over-water villa (from $1,109 to $1,725 a night, double occupancy), particularly fondly: "You didn't even want to leave your room it was just so special," Ojo said.
Hotel splurging is not limited to cash. Journalist Dan Frommer, 36, founder of the travel rewards newsletter Points Party, will go out of his way on a work trip to earn enough Hyatt points for a later luxury stay on vacation. On a work trip to San Francisco last year, he stayed in a Hyatt to get the points, even though it was in Emeryville, on the other side of the Bay and required an extensive bus ride each morning.
The reward? "I'm overlooking this skyline of Tokyo," he said, talking by phone from the 48th floor of the Andaz hotel there, where the entry-level rooms range from roughly $360 to $1,100 per night, depending on the time of year. The points price is steep, too - it cost him 25,000 a night - but worth it, he said.
"When you are on the other side of the world, when your sleep schedule is messed up, it's really nice to come back to a large, well-designed, well-appointed room with a beautiful view," Frommer said.
His strategy is to splurge for three nights. One night goes by too quickly; two is adequate, giving you one whole day to "spread your stuff out," Frommer said. But three feels like a real indulgence and enough time to enjoy all the hotel has to offer.

Congress&#xa0;right to subpoena Mueller report

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee should not have had to vote Wednesday to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. It should already have been sent to Congress. The fact that the body’s Democrats had to take this forcing action underscores why Attorney General William Barr’s handling of the document so far is irresponsible -- and, yes, suspicious.
Let’s look at the timeline. Mueller submitted his report March 22. Two days later, on March 24, Barr issued his four-page letter that included not one complete sentence from the report. Barr quoted the report as saying: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Note that the quote leaves out the beginning of the original sentence.
And note also that Barr’s own words said Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia.” The phase “did not establish” is not the same as “did not find,” but we have no way of knowing, absent the report itself, how significant that difference is. What we do know is that Barr seems to have put the best possible spin for Trump on what Mueller himself wrote.
Indeed, The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that there is dissatisfaction on the Mueller team with Barr’s account.
“Some of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators,” the paper reported, “have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated.”
Yet another reason why Congress and the public need to see the real thing.
And The Washington Post reported that “some members” of Mueller’s team “were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared.” Barr needs to release those summaries, too, and be asked why he didn’t make them public in or with his March 24 letter.
On obstruction, Barr quoted the Mueller document saying that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Then, Barr made an astonishing assertion: “The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.”
Barr, who had already criticized what he took to be Mueller’s theory on obstruction before he became attorney general, went on (surprise, surprise) to absolve the president, writing “that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”
But wait a minute: Did Mueller’s decision not to make a call mean that it was Barr’s decision to make? There is nothing that automatically gives Barr that power. Perhaps Mueller intended to leave the decision on obstruction to Congress, not to Barr. Maybe Mueller was silent on this issue in his report. Maybe he wasn’t. We can’t know, because we haven’t seen the report.
And then came a strange letter from Barr on March 29 in which he complained that many were “mischaracterizing” his March 24 letter.
“My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel’s investigation or report. ... I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.”
So a summary was not a summary, and his first letter was, well, incomplete, or at least not “exhaustive” or ... well, what was it? A news release? President Trump certainly had no problem crying from the heavens that Barr’s letter was a good-enough summary for him and that it cleared him of everything.
Which means that looking at everything Barr is doing with a suspicious eye is, at this point, the only safe thing to do. Especially when Trump, who had previously said he had no problem releasing the report, complained on Tuesday that it was a “disgrace” that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was now demanding the very sort of disclosure the president had once endorsed. Trump, it would seem, was for releasing the full report before he was against it.
When the committee voted for the subpoena on Wednesday, Nadler said: “The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct.
That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves -- not the attorney general’s summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence.” In light of everything that has happened since Mueller turned in his report on March 22, how could Congress settle for anything less?

Texto completo: Ask someone why they're investing for retirement, and they'll usually give two answers: to cover post-retirement living expenses and to help provide for a spouse after they're gone.
But what if "gone" comes far earlier than you expect? Term life insurance is a great – but often misunderstood – safety net.
Term life insurance is a policy with a fixed end date – usually 10, 20 or 30 years out, depending on when you expect the kids to be out of the house and your nest egg to be sufficient. It is meant to ensure your family can cover funeral expenses, debt and other needs after you're deceased.
I bought a term life insurance policy after my children were born, and think it's a smart move for most families. Those wanting lifelong coverage may find permanent life insurance more beneficial.
Yet industry observers have found many folks don't investigate life insurance options. TermLife2Go, which seeks to help consumers navigate this complex industry, found most people assume life insurance costs three times more than it really does.
Why? Insurance companies can't provide a quote until you answer a slew of questions about your health, habits and lifestyle. It's the verbal equivalent of a colonoscopy. Many fear filling out reams of paperwork or taking medical exams, only to find out they can't afford the insurance.
It's a vicious cycle.
Knowing how companies price life insurance helps you cut through that fog. TermLife2Go has a great online resource showing how insurance rates boil down to six factors: age, health, type and term, desired payout, gender and lifestyle.
Age is simple: The younger you are, the cheaper your coverage. Rates start jumping once you hit 40 and rise as you age, with availability more limited the older you get.
Health is the biggest swing factor. Nonsmokers pay less than smokers. Duh! Good family medical histories and healthy body types help, too. The more health issues you have, the more you'll pay. Major illness in your family history can also raise costs.
The type and term of plan you want is something you can control. Term life is generally cheaper than permanent policies – less risk for the insurer. A whole life policy – good until you die, as long as you pay the premiums – costs more. These permanent policies build cash value – excess premium that accumulates within the policy. Folks say they're like savings accounts. Some policies even offer investment options for the cash value. But added costs often make these unattractive.
My advice: You're usually better off buying cheaper term insurance and plugging the savings into your 401(k). But it's a personal choice.
Payout also is within your control and simple: The bigger the payout, the bigger the premium.
As for gender, ladies have it easier. Because a woman has a longer life expectancy than a man, her premium is typically lower. The gap isn't huge, but it is noteworthy.
Finally, lifestyle, is a potpourri. It includes occupation, hobbies, how much you drive and travel (and the relative danger of countries you visit frequently). Folks with high-risk jobs such as loggers and roofers pay higher premiums than office workers. So will those with risky hobbies, including motorcycle riding, wilderness backpacking, rock climbing and boating. If you spend too much time swimming with sharks – or boating in high-risk places – premiums get pricey. Couch potatoes typically pay higher rates than active and athletic folks.
Again, whether and what type of life insurance is right for you depends on you and your family's needs. What I hope you do now is investigate.

Fresh, local twist

Texto completo: Mason Moyle, who owns Keg & Cow in Cape Coral, was perfectly primed to launch his own restaurant.
The 26-year-old Michigan native started in restaurants right out of college when he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, and began working for the corporate stores of Mr. Brews Taphouse, a burger and beer chain popular in lower and central Wisconsin.
"I worked my way through the company," Moyle said.
"I started as a cook then went from cook to server to bartender to corporate auditor. There really wasn't a whole lot I didn't do."
In 2016, the corporate owner of Mr. Brews Taphouse decided to launch a location in Cape Coral, and when Moyle was asked to open the restaurant, he jumped at the opportunity.
His previous experience with all the levels of Mr. Brews served him well.
"I like to be really hands-on," he said, "and I like to know how to do everything in the restaurant. If it's busy and the kitchen gets backed up, I'll hop on the line and crank out tickets. I like to be able to help everyone."
In late 2018, Moyle decided he wanted to change a few things in the format of his restaurant. After talks with the corporate headquarters of Mr. Brews, he decided to go out on his own and re-branded his restaurant as Keg & Cow.
"I still have a great relationship with Mr. Brews," Moyle said.
"We mutually agreed that I wanted to do my own thing by changing up the menu, and they were very receptive. It was a very mutual decision to both go our own ways."
The space inside Keg & Cow is much the same as it was under Mr. Brews, though a touch cozier, Moyle said. The most notable updates are to the menu.
"The menu change, that's the thing we were really excited about," said Moyle.
"Being able to play with the menu and to have a seasonal menu. We're still beer and burgers, but we were able to add a lot more salads and sandwiches, play around with appetizers and change up the desserts. We also added more house-made sauces."
On the menu, one of the most popular items is the Bourbon Barrel Burger, which is drizzled with a root-beer bourbon mayonnaise made in-house.
"It's awesome," Moyle said. "My personal favorite."
Other popular dishes include the Cowlifornia Burger with pepper jack cheese, house-made guacamole and chipotle lime sauce, as well as the beer-battered onion rings, pretzels and cheese curds. The restaurant also has 48 beers on tap, with at least half dedicated to local beer, including Southwest Florida breweries such as Fort Myers Brewing, Palm City Brewing and Scotty's Bierwerks.
The menu has gone over well, Moyle said, as has the shift to Keg & Cow.
"The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It's been a really, really fun transition. We had two cool years as Mr. Brews, and now we get to fully do something new," Moyle said. "It's still a friendly place with a cozy atmosphere. We love talking to people about beer and sports, and we love serving great food."

Texto completo: We're living in what the French philosopher Michel Serres calls the "Thumbelina Generation": Instead of talking with our mouths, we're creating vast visual and textual worlds with finger taps and swipes. And hands aren't just the drivers of online communication. Now they're the stars of it, too. Facebook is crawling with "hands-only" videos in which pairs of gorgeous paws wield glue guns and mix slime and cook mini churros or whatever.
I'm conflicted about this trend. On the one hand (I am very sorry), it feels nice to give the face a break, along with all of the cultural baggage the selfie brings. On the other hand, I have crazy hands and please do not look at them. They are the dry, raw, nibbled-on manifestations of my anxiety. And so I D.I.Y. vicariously through the strong, supple hands of Facebook.com, mesmerized by the screen, destroying my own cuticles.

Episode Notes
Talk to the hands featured here: That's BeBe Zahara Benet giving face at the beginning, from the video for RuPaul's 2009 single "Cover Girl." The man covering Jewel's "Hands" is singer-songwriter Kyle Hancharick, and I love him; you can find his album here. Scott Loitsch is the man with the hands from which you cannot look away. Ellen Sirot is the hand supermodel featured in this legendary interview. Cardi B's nail tech is the "Queen of Bling" Jenny Bui; witness her creations @nailson7th.
Hey: Before this was an episode of "Internetting," it was an article in The New York Times. I'm indebted to Mr. Loitsch, a producer for Tasty, and Andrew Gauthier, BuzzFeed's head of video, for speaking to me about how they work with their hands, and to Tubular Labs for providing stats on hands-only videos. Also to James Leo Cahill, a cinema studies professor at the University of Toronto, who put all this hand business in world-historical context: "We've seen a re-enchantment of the hand," he told me. "It's finally getting its due as an onscreen organ."
Thumbs up,
Amanda

Texto completo: We commoners have always had an ambivalent relationship with celebrities. We admire them, and we resent them. We want to be more like them, and we want them to be more like us. We want to somehow close the gap between them, the stars that produce culture, and us, the audiences who consume it. Now the internet has given us unprecedented tools to exert control over celebrities, in increasingly creepy and invasive ways. Take on Hollywood with "Internetting" Episode 9.
Aim for the stars,
Amanda

Episode Notes
You can request your own personalized message from a celebrity here. Check out these hot illustrations from early "Star Trek" fanzines. Read The Ringer's Alyssa Bereznak on the cutthroat online communities dedicated to monitoring celebrity photoshop fails, and my colleague Kevin Roose on the rise of "deepfake" videos. I previously wrote about Cameo for The New York Times. Many years ago I wrote about the girls who imagine that the boys of One Direction are gay for each other, and that's still my favorite internet community ever. The greatest chronicler of the modern celebrity era is, in my opinion, the "Who? Weekly" podcast.

Texto completo: Illustration A demonstrator wears a swamp creature mask as David Bernhardt, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Interior secretary, testifies on March 28 during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee confirmation hearing.

In prepared remarks last month introducing David Bernhardt as President Donald Trump's nominee to be the next Interior secretary, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, a vocal supporter of the nominee, began by saying, "I have known Mr. Bernhardt personally and professionally for over two decades. His roots are deep in Colorado ..."
Stop right there. None of that matters. What matters is that Bernhardt is unwilling to protect public lands, and Gardner has lost sight of his responsibilities if he thinks his job is to promote his buddies. Gardner is supposed to serve the best interests of Coloradans and all Americans, and a vote to confirm Bernhardt would reflect a disregard for the irrevocable damage he would cause to public lands in Colorado and throughout the country.
When Bernhardt testified on March 28 before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, someone showed up at the hearing in a swamp-creature mask. The creature served as a vivid reminder that Trump's campaign promise to "drain the swamp" of Washington politics in fact presaged a program of stocking the swamp with scary monsters.
Bernhardt, a native of Rifle, is currently deputy Interior secretary, and he has served in other positions at the department going back to the George W. Bush administration. The department manages 500 million acres of public land, including national parks and Bureau of Land Management property. Millions of acres of that land sit in Colorado, where a significant portion of the economy is tied through tourism and recreation to those wild places. The department also oversees offshore energy development and national wildlife management.
It's Bernhardt's work for companies whose business is affected by decisions at Interior that makes his nomination so problematic. As a lobbyist with Denver-based Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Bernhardt represented energy interests such as Halliburton and the Independent Petroleum Association of America as they sought to exploit public resources. Once he became Interior's deputy secretary in 2017, according to the Center for Western Priorities , a nonpartisan conservation advocacy group, Bernhardt played a key role in "eviscerating" the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, opening the Arctic National Wildlife to drilling, and eliminating sage-grouse protections on millions of acres of habitat.
The Center for American Progress last month in a piece called "David Bernhardt Is President Trump's Most Conflicted Cabinet Nominee" put Bernhardt's conflicts of interest into perspective: "Of 27 former clients and employers with potential conflicts of interest," the piece said, "lobbying disclosure data reveal that 20 have actively lobbied the Department of the Interior since the beginning of 2017." Bernhardt says he recuses himself from decisions that could affect former clients — except starting in August he intends to stop recusing himself, he told senators, since ethics guidelines allow him after two years to weigh in on decisions that could benefit companies that once employed him.
A CNN investigation last month described Bernhardt as "one of the main architects of the Trump administration's deregulation agenda that has benefitted energy companies" and documented 15 decisions at Interior under Bernhardt that would directly benefit his former clients. A recent New York Times investigation detailed how Bernhardt intervened to block a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study that highlighted the threat that several popular pesticides present to hundreds of endangered species. The story noted how in private practice Bernhardt "was frequently paid to challenge endangered species-related matters" and described the pesticide study episode as "a case study of how the Trump administration has been using its power to second-guess or push aside conclusions reached by career professionals."
During the March 28 hearing, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden suggested Bernhardt was "just another corrupt official." It's hard to avoid that conclusion.
Bernhardt's nomination itself is troubling, but its faults are compounded considering that the job opening was created by the scandal-prompted departure of the previous Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke. And Zinke was just one of several former top administration officials to leave amid accusations of corruption. Remember former Health and Human Services Secretary and private jet travel aficionado Tom Price? Or former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and calendar scrubber Scott Pruitt? Bernhardt belongs to a rich tradition of Trump officials who trash the reputations of the agencies they lead.
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, supported Bernhardt's nomination as deputy Interior secretary two years ago. But, having observed Bernhardt in action, Bennet has changed his mind about the fellow Coloradan. "Mr. Bernhardt has worked to revoke national methane standards, drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and limit input from state and local officials with respect to the oil and gas leasing process in Colorado," Bennet said in a statement . "I cannot support his nomination to serve as Secretary of the Interior."
That is the only responsible position available to any senator from the Western states, which stand to suffer disproportionately from Bernhardt's industry-first agenda. There is scant reason to think Gardner will come to agree. But, as perhaps the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country, he should take note: Voters didn't get the drained swamp they were promised in 2016, and that will make them more determined to drain it when Gardner is up for reelection in 2020.

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: The husband of a Staten Island teacher who went missing earlier this week has been arrested in her slaying - along with the husband's girlfriend, police said.
The arrests came as a body found in a storage facility on Staten Island on Thursday was identified as that of Jeanine Cammarata, the 37-year-old mother of three, police said.
Her estranged husband, Michael Cammarata, 42, and his girlfriend, Ayisha Egea, 41, have been charged with second-degree murder, concealment of a human corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to the NYPD.
Jeanine Cammarata was last seen around 9 p.m. Saturday leaving Staten Island for Queens, where Michael Cammarata lives with their children. Concerned friends and family reported her missing on Tuesday after the typically "punctual" teacher didn't show up for work or a Monday court appearance related to her ongoing divorce, NYPD Assistant Chief of Detectives William Aubry said.
Her body was discovered inside a bag in a unit at Extra Space Storage on Arden Avenue, but the remains were "charred and unidentifiable," Aubry said during a briefing on Thursday afternoon. The medical examiner's office was able to confirm the body was Cammarata through dental records. Her cause of death is still pending, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said.
Michael Cammarata was already in police custody - charged with assaulting and stalking his estranged wife on an occasion unrelated to her disappearance - when investigators discovered her remains in the storage unit. At that point, the investigation changed from a missing persons case to a murder probe, Aubry said.
The pair had a history of domestic disputes dating to 2016, according to police. They separated two years ago and Cammarata had initiated divorce proceedings in February, which sparked a custody battle, The New York Times reported.
The children were placed with the Administration for Children's Services earlier this week when Michael Cammarata was taken into police custody, Aubry said.

Trump picking wrong fight in kicking sand at Obamacare

Texto completo: As I was leaving a speaking engagement recently at Bradley University, a young man, perhaps 30, stopped me and asked for a moment.
During my remarks, I had talked about the epic battle for the Affordable Care Act and my own financial struggles years earlier as the father of a child with a severe, chronic illness and huge medical expenses.
The young man pulled up close and spoke quietly.
"I wanted to tell you that I have a 5V2-year-old with a number of serious issues," he said. "We couldn't have handled it and gotten the care he needed without the ACA. I just wanted to say thankyou."
I have had more of these conversations than I can count since the ACA took effect. An older couple in a book signing line in Denver, sharing the story of their grandchild, who had an ordeal similar to my Lauren's, but the protection of the ACA; parents relieved that their adult children could stay on their insurance until the age of 26.
And then there was the American couple who chased me down after an insurance conference I addressed in Calgary. She had a highly advanced cancer that required extensive and expensive therapy. Without the ACA, she said, she would have run up against a lifetime cap on her insurance policy. The law banned such limits. She survived.
"We just wanted to askyou if you could thank President Obama for us," her husband said, hugging his tearful wife tightly.
I thought about these stories this week when I learned of President Trump's decision to change course and join a right-wing push, led by Republican state attorneys general, to invalidate the Affordable Care Act in the courts.
The ACA has meant health coverage for millions of working Americans and their families who otherwise would not have had it. It also bans insurance companies from imposing lifetime caps and refusing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like my daughter's epilepsy.
Most Americans agree that discriminating against people with chronic conditions or serious illnesses is wrong. One of the major reasons Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in November was precisely the efforts of President Trump and the GOP to roll back the ACA.
To this day, Trump has offered no plausible plan to replace the ACA or protect the tens of millions of Americans who suffer from pre-existing conditions and would once again be subject to discrimination by the insurance industry. That is not his concern.
Getting rid of Obamacare would be a headache for Trump
Repealing the law informally named for his predecessor, like building a wall at Mexico's expense, was a major applause line for the Republican base in Donald Trump's march to the nomination in 2016. And if one thing has become abundantly clear about this President, it's that the base must be served - first, last and always.
That's why destroying the Affordable Care Act - or getting caught trying - has become a political imperative. He tried and failed to kill it in Congress. He has done his best to strangle it administratively. Now, overruling both his attorney general and his secretary of health and human services, according to reports in the New York Times and Politico, he is determined to thwart it in the courts.
Trump shut down the government over the wall. There is no doubt that he would cut millions off of insurance to redeem his promise to the base to demolish Obama's health law.
When the ACA was passed nine years ago, I sobbed, knowing that other families would be spared the agony mine had known. I have met many of them in the intervening years. And I mist up all over again.
I've written before about the exchange I had with President Barack Obama the night the ACA passed. I thanked him on behalf of families like mine, with children who had pre-existing conditions. He simply replied, "That's why we do the work."
For Donald Trump, politics means something entirely different. It's about the acquisition and execution of power for his own aggrandizement. Trump is about winning, and he believes that stoking his base is what got him to the White House and will secure for him the chance to stay.

Texto completo: Police are investigating whether a body discovered in a storage facility Thursday morning is a Staten Island teacher and mother of three who went missing over the weekend.
Jeanine Cammarata, 37, was last seen around 9 p.m. Saturday at a house on McVeigh Avenue in New Springville. Cammarata, who lives near Randall Manor, was reported missing on Tuesday, according to police.
The remains discovered inside a bag in a unit at Extra Space Storage on Arden Avenue were "charred and unidentifiable," NYPD Assistant Chief of Detectives William Aubry said during a briefing Thursday afternoon. The medical examiner's office is conducting an autopsy to determine the indentity and cause of death.
"The human remains are unrecognizable," he added.
AMNWMISSING190405TW1
The investigation has now taken a turn from a missing persons case to a murder probe, Aubry said. Cammarata's estranged husband, Michael Cammarata, is the "primary suspect" in her disappearance, he added.
Michael Cammarata was taken into custody Wednesday and is being held on charges related to an assault that predates his wife's disappearance, police said. He was still in custody Thursday evening.
"We're working with the Staten Island district attorney to establish probable cause and justification to charge him with murder," Aubry said.
Friends and family first became worried about Cammarata on Monday when she didn't show up for work and missed a court appearance related to her ongoing divorce, according to Aubry. She initiated the divorce in February, but the couple separated two years ago because of domestic violence, The New York Times reported.
Cammarata and her husband have a history of disputes reported to the NYPD dating to 2016, but Aubry said there was no active order of protection at the time of her disappearance.
She was last seen leaving Staten Island for Queens, where Michael Cammarata lives with their children. With their father in police custody and their mother missing, the children have been placed with the Administration for Children's Services.
Aubry would not comment on what led police to discover the human remains at Extra Space Storage, which is just over 4 miles away from where Cammarata was last seen, or who owns the unit where the body was found. Police were searching the facility Thursday afternoon for additional evidence and the investigation is still active.
"We have search warrants to continue to execute, forensic evidence to examine, witnesses to speak to, video and electronic evidence to review and we're still looking for Ms. Cammarata's 2017 white Chevy Cruze,"

Texto completo: Currently, our country is led by a man a questionable intellect, questionable moral character with a tenuous grasp of the English language. And many of us wonder: Surely, we, as a country, can do better and, indeed, deserve better than this.
Suddenly, someone appears on the horizon that can give us hope for a better leader. Someone who graduated valedictorian from his high school class and went on to graduate from Harvard with honors.
Who attended Pembroke Collage at Oxford graduating at the top of his class. And become a Rhodes Scholar. Is currently in his second term as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Is a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve and has served in Afghanistan.
He speaks seven languages (however, by his own admission is not fluent in all of them) and is exceedingly articulate in English.
At age 37 he is wise beyond his years. Remember this name: Pete Buttigieg. He's a breath of fresh air and he wants to be our president. And, by the way, he plays concert piano.

Prager's comments a disappointment The Desert Town Hall began as an interesting educational lecture series with speakers on diverse subjects. As expected, some lectures were more interesting to us and some celebrities were better speakers. Newt Gingrich, Chris Wallace and Hedrick Smith were among the best while Scott Kelly and Caroline Kennedy were among the worst.
A primary element of the forum is to introduce high school students to a broad spectrum of topics. Students from area high schools are invited to meet and interview the speakers in the afternoon and to stay for the lecture. Sadly, the forum has become a political event for the far right.
On Sunday night, Dennis Prager said that it wasn't important for a U.S. president to set an example; he specifically mentioned infidelity. When he began his tirade against the media – and specifically the New York Times – we left before the lecture ended.
We have attended the forum for 20-plus years and it is with great disappointment that this important educational series has lost its focus. Mr. Prager's comments were not only offensive, they were inappropriate for an event designed to educate and support students.

So many 'rights' For the past few years there has been much ado about water and water "rights."
There are claims from many entities — IID, various tribes, Colorado, Arizona, the Nestle Co. — just to name a few.
Maybe I missed it, but who or what granted these "rights" that so many claim?

Texto completo: Taxpayers will end up paying for Sullivan for the rest of his life
Well, Jacob Sullivan got what he wanted. Death row. He didn't want to be in general population because of danger to him. I doubt that he will be in contact with the other prisoners. And he probably knows that there is a moratorium in Pennsylvania and he probably will live his life out in prison.
And guess who pays?
Taxpayers. What's wrong with this antiquated system?

Democrats, the media
misled public for two years
In the March 29 article about Democratic leadership responses to the Barr summary of the Mueller report, Nancy Pelosi - in supporting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff - is quoted as saying "What is the president afraid of, is he afraid of the truth?"
The truth? Before Democrats and their water carriers from CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times and others once again get way ahead of their skis regarding truth and Trump/Russia collusion, at least one of them might consider acknowledging with regard to their dishonest assertions and coverage over the last two years - in the words of Ed Pawlowski - "I wasn't correctly telling the truth."
And I believe that President Trump and most Americans are intensely interested in learning the truth about how the anti-Trump crowd got the country twisted into a pretzel over alleged Russia collusion.

Throwing out the ACA may
hurt millions of Americans
The Trump administration wants the entire Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, declared unconstitutional and thrown out. This action includes provisions protecting tens of million of Americans with pre-existing conditions. This is occurring in spite of President Trump's repeated pledge to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. I am finding this president's word to be worthless.
A lot of people have forgotten what it was like before Obamacare; I haven't. It was a time of anxiety if you had a pre-existing condition. We knew that if we had a break in coverage, we could be excluded by our insurance company.
What is alarming now is that this president has no back-up plan. He hasn't thought this through. Premiums for those who have pre-existing conditions could skyrocket.
For old people like Donald Trump and me, health care is serious business. But the president we have today doesn't seem to understand this.

Dr. Okunski was a caring, dedicated surgeon and person
I was sorry to read that Dr. Walter Okunski had passed away. Dr. Okunski was an excellent, compassionate, caring, dedicated surgeon and person.
Dr. Okunski operated on my back in 1982 for an advanced melanoma. I feel I owe my life to his skill. I'm sure there are countless others he helped during his long, prominent career. He always had a smile and words of encouragement. Dr. Okunski will be missed by many.

Argument in favor of Sunday hunting doesn't hold water
A recent letter writer, who favors Sunday hunting, chided those who are opposed to it. He argues against the two main reasons the opponents mention. He states that "there are numerous places where hunting is never allowed ... if you fear hunters."
My response? There are numerous days that he can hunt, as well. He laughs at the other stated opposing claim that "animals need a day off," yet makes the same comical claim that "they have five days of rest now." As if the animals know that.

Pennsylvanians should
support House Bill 785
One bill in Harrisburg that could soon be voted on by the House deserves our attention because it's a reflection of who we are. It's called the Employee Rights Notification Act (HB 785). This legislation would require new public servants to know what their rights are when it comes to union membership. It will also nullify state laws that violate the Constitution as based on a recent Supreme Court decision, Janus versus AFSCME.
For decades our public servants have worked under the requirement that they have to pay a union in order to serve their community. The idea that any one of us should be required to pay any private group to be able to work for state government is a blatant violation of our values as Americans, along with the very first Amendment, that our founders included in the Constitution.
I'm sure many workers are completely fine with their union and what they pay them. However, I know many aren't fine with it. It's time that we give them and their choices the respect and dignity they deserve. I'm proud to say that our local Representative Jerry Knowles (R-Schuylkill) co-sponsored HB 785.

When was America not great?
Eric Holder commented, "exactly when did you (President Trump) think America was great?" This ungrateful comment struck me right at my core. This is a person who went to Columbia Law School. Who made it to the top, was the United States attorney general.
Maybe Holder should have been with me when I was in the U.S. Marine Corps in the late '60s and early '70s, in Southeast Asian countries. Where people eat rice three times a day and, when inflation hits, they go down to eating rice twice a day.
Or he could have noticed the people that build huts over water to be cool at night so they could sleep. And all of this still goes on. I've traveled these countries many times in my life, and in recent years.
Or how about the million legal people who enter this country yearly, and the people risking their lives, trying to reach land in their makeshift boats.
So my question to Eric Holder is this: When was America not great?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In a video released Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden promises to be more "mindful and respectful" of people's personal space in response to allegations of unwanted and inappropriate behavior.
Biden, who is considering a bid for the White House in 2020, says his touching was all about making a "human connection."
"It's just who I am," Biden says in the video. "I've never thought of politics as cold or antiseptic."
He says close contact is his way of showing people he cares.
"I've always tried to make a human connection. That's my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this," Biden says. "It's the way I've always been. It's the way I've tried to show I care about them and I'm listening."
But he says he understands times have changed and so should his behavior. "I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying. I understand," Biden says. "I'll be much more mindful."
"I'll always believe that governing, quite frankly life for that matter, is about connecting with people," he says. "That won't change, but I will be more mindful and respectful of people's personal space – and that's a good thing."
Four women accused Biden of unwanted touching and kissing.
The string of accusations started when Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he kissed the back of her head. In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during an event in 2014 in Nevada where he spoke to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores wrote. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn't process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused."
Since then, three other women have come forward with similar accusations, including two on Tuesday who told their stories to The New York Times.
Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Caruso, 22, said she was 19 at the time of the incident, which happened after she told her story of an assault.
"It doesn't even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that," she told the Times. "These are supposed to be people you can trust."
President Donald Trump suggested at an event Tuesday that Biden may have been one of the Democrats' best shots at taking the White House in 2020, then he cracked several jokes.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him, our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him. I don't know him well. I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?'"

From Bubble Memory to Hot Spots and a Fly Rod

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent based in Washington, discussed the tech he's using.
You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan, one of your many roles for the newspaper. When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s, what tech were you equipped with?
In retrospect, nothing very impressive. Our "portable" computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter, had a tiny cathode-ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory, which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives.
Needless to say, it was a technology whose time never arrived. Oh, and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top. You put the handset of a hard-line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second. Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room, where someone would type out the story that you read to them.
When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops, I sent a note to New York asking what to do with these dinosaurs. The answer I got back was: Your office looks out over Tokyo Bay. Figure it out.
So today the technology is lots faster, but perhaps not a lot more reliable. What's the worst tech failure you've suffered?
Naturally, things die when deadlines are tightest. There was the time I was rushing off the back stairs of Air Force One in the Middle East with an open laptop, story half-written and late to the editing desk, and managed to drop my computer 20 feet on the tarmac. (Not good.) I've had modems die in Egypt, and the blue screen of death crawl across my laptop in India. Power supplies don't like variable current -- I've melted my share.
This has all made me focus intently on what NASA calls "mission-critical components." If you can't file your story -- or record video, or connect up with "The Daily" -- you might as well not be there.
So I travel with a laptop and a backup iPad with a keyboard, so there is always a way to write. I take two phones -- and two booster battery packs. I carry an AT&T portable hot spot, and still I've had to fall back at times on the built-in Wi-Fi hot spot on my iPhone. Oh, and a Logitech camera that allows me to do TV hits over a Skype connection without using the built-in pinhole camera in the laptop.
So my backpack weighs plenty -- and my wife and our sons think carrying it everywhere is faintly ridiculous. Until they run out of cellphone power.
You'd think that belt-and-suspenders approach would cover everything. It doesn't. In Hanoi, Vietnam, this year for a summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, we were, as my colleague Edward Wong put it, "comms cursed."
Lots of things failed. It didn't help that I was staying in the Metropole hotel, where the meeting was being held, and security personnel blanketed the lobby with a cellphone suppression technology that keeps terrorists from detonating bombs remotely. Turns out it also keeps reporters from updating their stories on the web.
You published your third book, "The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age," last year. It's a geopolitical look at how nations are using cyberweapons, and not just for espionage. Ever been a target?
I'm afraid that if you are in my line of work -- writing about the intersection of technology, spying, cybersabotage and national power -- you attract attention from intelligence services.
In Beijing in 2017 with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, I made the mistake of looking up something about the Tiananmen Square massacre from my hotel room, over a portable hot spot. Big mistake. The hot spot stopped working. I couldn't revive it in Japan, or back at home. We later determined that Chinese intelligence had fried the firmware.
A few years ago I began seeing that big red banner over my email account that declared: "We have detected a state-sponsored attacker seeking to obtain your data." That could be anyone: Russians who didn't like our investigations into the 2016 presidential election and subsequent hacks; Chinese People's Liberation Army officers who didn't care for our work exposing Unit 61398, which stole intellectual property; North Koreans who didn't like our coverage of the Sony hack, the Bangladeshi central bank cyberheist or the cyberattacks on their missiles.
And I've survived enough F.B.I. leak investigations to become mildly paranoid about our own government.
So what do you use to protect yourself?
There is no permanent technological solution to hacking, data manipulation and, soon, deep fakes -- like climate change, this is a problem we have to manage. Ultimately, we will need a mix of technology, political agreements and retaliatory responses that establish that attacks are not cost-free.
That said, I'm a big fan of Google's Advanced Protection program. It uses a combination of a key that fits in a USB slot (with a button that must be pressed) and a Bluetooth dongle, each registered to your computer or cellphone. Try to get access to someone's accounts on a computer without that hardware present and you don't get in.
If you were cyber king for a day, what mandates would you issue?
First, I'd ban the use of any voting machine that doesn't rely on a hand-marked paper ballot, so there is something to count later. I'd require encryption for all personal information that you are asked turn over, including when I hand my passport to a hotel clerk. (Hear that, Marriott? It's time.)
And I'd make it illegal to have Social Security numbers used as an identifier on any electronic document, site, app or password combination. It's the one number in your life you simply cannot change, without extraordinary effort. It was never intended to be used as a secure identifier. So let's not try.
What favorite cool technology do you always take with you?
Sanity-preservation devices that cut me off from the world, from editors and from the complaints of presidents, secretaries of state and national security officials. The three most vital: Bose noise-canceling headphones, a small shortwave radio and a seven-piece, four-weight fly rod that breaks down to fit in a tube under a foot long.
When the weather warms up, I carry the rod in that overloaded backpack along with a reel and a box of flies. No batteries required. I've been known to sneak out of hotels in early-morning hours to cast into rivers, harbors, ponds, you name it. I don't even care if nothing's biting -- the casting is therapeutic.
Don't tell the bosses, O.K.?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In a video released Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden promised to be more "mindful and respectful" of people's personal space in response to mounting allegations of unwanted and inappropriate behavior.
Biden, who is considering a bid for the White House in 2020, said his touching was all about making a "human connection. "
"It's just who I am," Biden says in the video. "I've never thought of politics as cold or antiseptic. "
He continued, explaining his close contact with people is his way of showing people he cares.
"I’ve always tried to be, in my career, I’ve always tried to make a human connection. That’s my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this,” Biden said. “It’s the way I’ve always been. It’s the way I’ve tried to show I care about them and I’m listening. ”
But, the former vice president said he understood that times have changed and with that, so should his behavior. "I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying. I understand," Biden says. "I’ll be much more mindful. "
"I’ll always believe that governing, quite frankly, life for that matter, is about connecting with people," Biden says. "That won’t change but I will be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space— and that’s a good thing. "

More: Joe Biden says he never 'acted inappropriately. ' What are people saying about him?
The video comes on the heels of at least four women who have accused the former vice president of unwanted touching and kissing.
The string of accusations began after Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he allegedly kissed the back of her head.
In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during a 2014 event in Nevada where he was speaking to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores writes. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
Since then, three other women have come forward with similar accusations involving Biden, including two on Tuesday who told their stories to the New York Times.

Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault at UNLV in Las Vegas. Caruso, 22, said she was 19 at the time and told the Times that the incident happened after she finished telling her story of an assault.
"It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that," she told the Times. "These are supposed to be people you can trust. "
The allegations against Biden come amid #MeToo, a movement started nearly a decade ago that went viral in 2017 as women in Hollywood and across the country began sharing stories of sexual harassment and assault.
It’s led to the resignation or downfall of more than 100 entertainers, executives and politicians, including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. Former Minnesota Democrat Sen. Al Franken announced his resignation in 2017 following accusations of sexual misconduct.
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. , also stepped down, as well as Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. , who resigned amid reports he discussed with female staffers the possibility they could be surrogates for his and his wife's baby.
President Donald Trump suggested at an event Tuesday that Biden may have been one of the Democrats' best shots at taking the White House in 2020 but then cracked several jokes at the allegations that have surfaced about his behavior.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him. Our former vice president," Trump said of Biden. "I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?'"
Later, Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner about a general who told him defeating ISIS could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the years, including eight women who have accused him of forcibly kissing them.
Trump has denied the allegations. In an “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced during the final weeks of the presidential campaign in 2016, Trump was heard making lewd comments and bragging about groping women. The president has said that was "locker-room banter. "

Resumen: Allegations that Joe Biden made women uncomfortable may not have a big impact in early voting states.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – When Joe Biden attended a function at South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian's house a few years ago, Biden reached down and rubbed noses with Harpootlian's 92-year-old mother.
"These are gestures that we’ve all seen before," Harpootlian said of Biden, who has been accused by women of unwanted, inappropriate behavior. "He’s hugged my mother, my brother, my sister, my wife, my daughter. I think he just petted the family dog but he may have hugged the dog too. "
Calling the recent allegations a tempest in a teapot, Harpootilan, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, said Tuesday that he's still expecting Biden to enter the 2020 presidential race – and still hopes he does.
"All of us that support the vice president understand the intent behind those gestures," Harpootlian. "None of us are concerned about it. I don’t think it will impede anybody in writing a check, voicing support. "

In a statement issued Sunday, Biden denied any wrongdoing but promised to "listen respectfully" to such claims.
The New York Times on Tuesday night published accounts from two additional women who said Biden's close contact made them feel uncomfortable.
The former vice president, who leads the large field of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early polls, could announce this month whether he is getting in. The women's descriptions of their reactions to interactions with Biden could cause some backers to think twice before committing to Biden.
But Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm's College, does not expect to see a dramatic change in Biden's standing when the institute's pollsters go back into the field this week.
"Many voters are saying this is kind of minor compared to what we've seen in the past with candidates and accusations," Levesque said Tuesday.
In a first-person account for New York Magazine, former Democratic Nevada state representative Lucy Flores, 39, said that Biden placed his hands on her shoulders at a 2014 rally during her unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," she wrote. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
On Monday, the Hartford Courant reported that Connecticut woman Amy Lappos, 43, said Biden grabbed the back of her neck, pulled her close and rubbed noses with her at an October 2009 Democratic fundraiser.
"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head," Lappos told the newspaper. "He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth. "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday that the stories are not "disqualifying" for Biden.
She said Biden, who has long been known to be physically affectionate toward his male and female friends, needs to improve his understanding of the importance of people's personal space.
"He has to understand that in the world we're in now that people's space is important to them," Pelosi said.
None of Biden's potential 2020 Democratic primary opponents has said the allegations should keep him out of the race, but none has rushed to his defense either.
Jerry Crawford, a longtime Democratic operative in Iowa, said the reaction among Iowa Democrats is likely to fall along generational lines. Those over 50 will think it's much ado about nothing. But it could hurt Biden with millennial voters.
"The #MeToo movement has made an increasing amount of conduct viewed as unacceptable – even though historically it wouldn't have been," he said.
The movement began nearly a decade ago and went viral in 2017 as women in Hollywood and across the country began sharing stories of sexual harassment and assault. It’s led to the resignation or downfall of more than 100 entertainers, executives and politicians, including Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Kevin Spacey. Former Minnesota Democrat Sen. Al Franken announced his resignation in 2017 following accusations of sexual misconduct. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. , also stepped down, along with Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. , who resigned amid reports he discussed with female staffers the possibility they could be surrogates for his and his wife's baby.
More than a dozen women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct over the years, including eight women who have accused him of forcibly kissing them. Trump has denied the allegations. In an “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced during the final weeks of the presidential campaign in 2016, Trump was heard making lewd comments and bragging about groping women. The president has said that was "locker-room banter. "
Crawford, who hasn't decided on a 2020 nominee, isn't likely to back Biden if the former vice president joins the race. But the recent allegations are not the reason why.
"I don't believe this is the tip of the iceberg and more is going to come," he said. "I would say, the vice president is learning a lesson about the differences from when he started in this business and today in terms of the attitudes about men and women. "
Steve Schale, who ran the Obama-Biden campaign in Florida in 2008 and was a senior adviser to the 2012 re-election effort in the Sunshine State, said Tuesday that he has not seen any wavering of support for Biden.
Schale has seen Biden interact with voters and backers at numerous campaign events for more than a decade. What he witnessed was someone who treated people with a level of respect and affection as if they were family, he said.
"Honestly, it’s that personal connection that the vice president has with everyday people around the country, which is frankly what drives so many of us to be willing to go fight for him if he runs," Schale said "It is the fact that he is so approachable, that he is very real, that his life experiences are not uncommon to so many people. ”
Biden's team is circulating statements from women supportive of him.
"In my experience, he is warm and affectionate among women (and men)," Susan Rice, former national-security adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted Monday. "But never have I found his actions inappropriate or uncomfortable. "
More: I was with Joe Biden when no one was looking, and he was always a champion for women
Harpootlian, whom Biden backed in his 2018 state Senate race, did not support Biden in the 2008 Democratic primary. And he backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
But Harpootlian said Biden remains his top choice for 2020 because he thinks Biden has the best chance of beating Donald Trump.
"Overriding all that," Harpootlian said, "he's the most decent human being I have met in 40 years of politics. "

Meet the SC philosopher who advises 'The Good Place' writers

Texto completo: Todd May isn't sure how his book "Death" ended up in the hands of a sitcom writer at NBC, but he aims to find out one day. It was the beginning of a fruitful, if unlikely, relationship.
May, a philosophy professor at Clemson University, is one of a handful of experts the television network consults on its quirky series "The Good Place." The show follows the moral quandaries of characters in an afterlife paradise gone haywire.
After May's 2009 treatise on mortality made an impression on one of the writers, who passed it on to his boss and show creator Michael Schur, May found himself having long, fascinating conversations with Schur.
"We had one Skype, which then turned into a series of Skypes," May said.
The network has since flown him out to Los Angeles for hours-long talks in the writers' room.
As it turns out, Schur - who made his name with hit shows like "The Office," ''Parks and Recreation" and "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" - wanted to make people laugh, but he also wanted to get the details right.
When a character made a joke about Aristotle, Schur wanted to fact-check the punchline. When the moral philosopher character Chidi loosened up on his strict Kantian position, he wanted the shift to look believable to folks who have read some Kant.
Consulting on a network TV show is an odd career turn for an expert on poststructuralism and other esoteric topics in 20th century continental philosophy. May's work was not always this accessible: In classic academic form, his 1989 doctoral thesis at Penn State was titled "Psychology, Knowledge, Politics: The Epistemic Grounds of Michel Foucault's Genealogy of Psychology."
But with three decades of college teaching and research under his belt, May said he was ready to share what he'd learned with the world.
"When you start in academics, you've got to show that you've got chops in the field that you're in - you can speak the lingo, make the moves," May said. "So I did all that early on, but as I went on, I started thinking I could probably write for a wider audience. The machinery's all there, but I don't have to show all the machinery."
Outside of the ivory tower and millions of weekly "Good Place" viewers, May has taken his teaching to at least one other venue that might cause Foucault to raise his eyebrows: prison.
On a chance invitation from a friend, May started teaching philosophy classes this year at Perry Correctional Institution, a prison about 40 miles from Clemson. He now teaches two class groups: one for general population, one for lifers.
"The students were really responsive, the questions they asked were great, they did the reading. I'd give them just a few pages of reading for each class, but you could see they had it all marked up," he said.
The inmates have pondered the meaning of life, he said, and they've had lively debates on gun control and the death penalty.
Back on campus in the spring of 2018, May's undergraduate students were studying Aristotle at the same time as the inmates. When the students asked how the inmates were handling the material, May told them, "Your goal should be to be as motivated as the prisoners are."
Later in the year, May made waves with a provocatively titled Dec. 17 op-ed in the New York Times: "Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?" The site closed the comments section after 1,630 responses.
Meanwhile, on NBC, the topic of death has provided rich soil for comedy. "The Good Place" was recently renewed for its fourth season.
"In the book ('Death'), I write that death is something that on the one hand takes away meaning from us because it cuts us off, but on the other hand it gives us meaning because if we were immortal, life would be shapeless," May said. "So we construct our lives and we try to live our morality within our mortality."
With the third season on hiatus during December, May recently sat down for some lengthy on-camera interviews on basic topics like utilitarianism, psychological egoism and Kantian deontology (the study of duty and obligation).
The hours-long interviews have been boiled down into YouTube clips for a web series.
His four-minute breakdown of existentialism has racked up 65,000 views since mid-December.

Hank’s owner tests waters for sale

Texto completo: Every 12 years, Henry Adaniya likes to upend things. It’s been that long since he opened Hank’s Haute Dogs in Kakaako, and now he’s exploring a sale.
“It’s 12 years, so I’m getting kind of antsy,” Adaniya said Tuesday.
He doesn’t want to shutter Hank’s, nor does he necessarily want to sever his ties with the upscale hot-dog spot he opened in 2007. “Ideally, I would find a partner to take it to the next level.”
The restaurant was placed on commercial property lists a few weeks ago at $600,000 — half of that for the property at Salt at Our Kakaako, equipment and lease; the other half for acquiring the brand.
Adaniya said he is not considering buyers who want to turn the space into something else. “I’m not looking to close Hank’s. I don’t want to see that go.”
But the brand is ready for expansion, he said, and he doesn’t have the experience to run multiple outlets. Hank’s now has one additional location, in Lahaina.
The listing was a way to test the waters, and has drawn about a half-dozen inquiries from local, mainland and Japanese interests, Adaniya said. He is hoping to find an experienced individual or a restaurant group, perhaps interested in keeping him on as a partner.
If not, he has other projects in mind: consulting, writing, perhaps even opening a wine bar.
Twelve years does seem to be a marker in Adaniya’s career. He came to Hawaii from Chicago after 12 years as owner of Trio, a restaurant that accumulated five Mobil Travel Guide stars under acclaimed chef Grant Achatz. Trio closed in 2006, and Adaniya left Chicago’s cold for Hawaii, where his parents once ran a hot-dog stand.
The upscale restaurant was the occupation of his youth, he said. “Hot dogs were my midlife thing.”
Turning 65 this year, he is looking toward the next 12 years. “I don’t think retirement is ever in the cards. Ask any restaurateur.”
ON THE MOVE
Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort has hired Stephanie Bleichner as its new marketing services manager. She previously served as an assistant account executive for MVNP, a local advertising agency where she worked on accounts for the Hawaii Visitors & Convention Bureau and Hilton Hawaiian Village. Prior to MVNP, Bleichner worked at Best Beverage Catering as well as South Beach Bar & Grill, in San Diego.
ACLU of Hawaii has announced that Kathleen Wong is the organization’s new communications manager. She previously served as communications manager for the Honolulu Museum of Art. Wong interned and worked for publications such as Refinery29, Mashable, Mic and High Times and has bylines with New York Magazine’s The Cut, Honolulu Magazine, The New York Times as well as Hawaii Luxury Magazine.
The King Kamehameha Celebration Commission has appointed Amy Hammond, a local marketing and event production specialist, as its new executive director. Prior to joining the commission, Hammond served as executive director of Made in Hawaii Festival where she handled public relations, marketing and operations as well as coordinated the Hawaii Book and Music Festival, including managing the event’s public relations efforts.

Texto completo: For years, 39 Pearl Street in Dumbo was the embodiment of Brooklyn's bohemian renaissance. The rock band Sonic Youth got its start on the fifth floor, while the band Blue Öyster Cult used to rehearse downstairs. Many of the residents have been artists, teachers and filmmakers whose apartments were rent-controlled before they pooled resources and bought the building in 1998.
Now a city clerical error threatens to take it away.
The error -- which classified the building as having 11 or more units instead of the eight it actually has -- vaulted 39 Pearl Street into a different tax category, causing taxes to increase by more than $100,000 over the past five years. Some residents of the building have taken on roommates or are thinking of dropping health insurance in order to afford the bigger bill.
In addition to this building in Dumbo, the city could be overtaxing hundreds of other small buildings, a New York Times analysis found, while making it difficult for their owners to fix the problem. These taxpayers must navigate a confusing and opaque appeals process. When the cases land in court, the city fights to keep the taxes it has collected -- even when they have been collected because of a mistake.
"We had a place that we could live, we had a place that we could make our art," said Julia Loktev, a filmmaker who lives at 39 Pearl Street. "It's the reason the city thrives."

A spokeswoman for the Department of Finance, Sonia Alleyne, said the city was deeply concerned about overtaxation, noting that the de Blasio administration had instituted new rules to correct errors and had refunded more than $4 million to property owners in the past two fiscal years.
Even so, the city has continued to oppose taxpayers in court.
"It's bewildering to us," said YuhTyng Patka, a lawyer who has handled several claims of overtaxation, including those by residents of 39 Pearl Street. "We just don't understand why they are fighting so hard against small property owners."
The problem hinges on assessments, a value the city provides properties each year that can help determine how much they pay in taxes. In New York City, building exteriors must be inspected every three years to help determine the assessment. But these external inspections don't always correctly identify how many units are in a building, a crucial factor in determining property taxes.
Under state law, the assessments of small buildings -- those that have between four and 10 apartments -- cannot rise more than 8 percent a year, or 30 percent over five years. The savings can be great, particularly in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods where a building's value can double or even triple over a short period. There is no similar cap on the assessments of larger buildings.
But the number of buildings that are entitled to these protections is up for debate. The city says that when it counts the number of units in a building, it includes commercial space, such as a street-level storefront. State law, however, says nothing about commercial space. Confounding the problem is that the city's decision making has been uneven: In 2017, it agreed in court that a property with 10 residential units and one commercial space qualified for the cap, throwing into question the status of many other properties.
Even for those buildings whose total count falls below the threshold, fixing the mistake -- and recouping the money -- can be challenging.
In 2016 the city instituted an appeal process which it said fixed misclassifications and reduced assessments by more than $150 million. But when that process fails, some buildings have sued the city. While the city has admitted in court that properties have been misclassified, it has generally refused to return property taxes to where they would be if the errors had not happened, tax attorneys said, locking the buildings permanently into the higher assessment.
Manhattan and Brooklyn each has one judge hearing these cases, and they both have accepted the city's argument that taxpayers, not the city, are responsible for making sure they are properly billed. Only one judge has sided with owners in recent years, but she was transferred out of that court, in Manhattan, in 2014.
When Ms. Loktev moved into her loft apartment on the Brooklyn waterfront in 1996, the neighborhood was desolate. There were no stores or cafes, and wild dogs were known to roam the streets at night.
Two years later, Ms. Loktev and her neighbors bought the industrial building from their landlady when she retired. Since then, they have been working to bring it into compliance with the building code and to transform the lofts into living spaces.
Early last year, 39 Pearl Street requested that the city recount the units in the building. An inspector came out to survey the building. But when the tax roll was released by the city in May 2018, it showed no change.
Marcia Hillis, a teacher and painter, raised her two sons in the building. Over the years she volunteered on neighborhood associations and sat on her local community board. One of her biggest victories was securing the building's right to have municipal trash pickup. "For those of us who endured all those challenges, we really shouldn't be kicked out by the city at this point," she said.
A floor above, Anna Harper, a jewelry maker, lives with her husband, an artist. She's been in the building since 1992. "The new roof was my retirement fund," she says. "If we end up losing the building because of the taxes, we will have nothing."
This year, 39 Pearl Street paid $133,000 in property taxes -- instead of the $32,000 the building would have paid without the error.
In January, a full year after the building filed its request to correct the error, the city moved 39 Pearl Street into the correct category. But instead of lowering the assessment to where it would have been without the mistake, it went up -- leaving the building in an even worse position than before.
"We're not saying, please lower our property values, or give us special treatment," Ms. Loktev said. "We are asking for the city not to profiteer off a mistake they have admitted."
In response to questions from the Times, the city said that 39 Pearl Street is "under review." Residents, who had up until that point heard nothing of any review, are hoping a determination could be made before next year's tax bill, which they expect to be $220,000. Ms. Loktev calculated that by next year the building will have overpaid the city more than $400,000.
The Dumbo of today is not the frontier it was. Multimillion-dollar condominiums fill the skyline and tech start-ups occupy loft spaces where artists once lived.
The building at 39 Pearl Street is worth considerably more than its 1998 purchase price, but because it is still not up to code, the options for resale are limited. The owners don't want to sell; they see themselves as part of the neighborhood's history. But they say they can hold on for only so long.
"If we lose this space, we'll have to leave New York," said Ms. Harper, the jeweler, "because of a clerical error."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO's 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance. So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia.
"I accept there are differences, but when it comes to defense spending we all agree," Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr. Trump, putting a positive spin on the situation.
He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional $100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr. Trump with "having a real impact."
"I say that because it is a fact," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "Allies are now really stepping up."
But not all. Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending -- meaning that Europe's economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024.
The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr. Stoltenberg's unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States.
He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr. Trump. A trained statistician, Mr. Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen.
But his credit of Mr. Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders.
"He is a little too diplomatic," said Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head."
Mr. Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr. Trump against German politicians, who have made clear they are sick of the president's demands. The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr. Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr. Trump's drive for a more equitable share of military burdens.
Germany this year is putting 1.35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending, and in 2020 will spend 1.37 percent. New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1.25 percent of its economic output by 2023.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal. "Germany will keep its promise," Ms. von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio.
Hours later, fueling the pressure, Mr. Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense.
In the Oval Office, Mr. Stoltenberg sat stone-faced as Mr. Trump criticized Germany for "not paying their fair share." The president also predicted: "I think we'll get along with Russia."
Since 2014, NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression. It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War.
But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted, and does not yet know how to tackle -- including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics, and China's economic investments in telecommunications networks.
In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Stoltenberg suggested the alliance's policy on Russia was consistent with Mr. Trump's desire for better relations. He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country, Norway, with Russia on fisheries and other matters.

"We now have a strong, common understanding of how to approach Russia," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense."
The gatherings to commemorate NATO's anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government. But Mr. Trump's angry speeches, public and private, at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers.

The goal, according to current and former American and European officials, was to limit Mr. Trump's participation.
Even Tuesday's meeting with Mr. Trump was not originally on Mr. Stoltenberg's agenda. But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress, a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday.
European officials said Mr. Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms. Pelosi announced it. That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat-led House, which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance.
Last week, NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr. Stoltenberg's term a second time, by two more years, meaning he would leave office in 2022. It is an acknowledgment of Mr. Stoltenberg's deft touch not just with Mr. Trump, but also with other difficult alliance leaders, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary.
Mr. Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday. "I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted," he said.
European officials said their worries about Mr. Stoltenberg's cozy relationship with Mr. Trump were pushed aside, largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader. Mr. Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020, at the height of an intense election in the United States.
In the interview with The Times, Mr. Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms. Merkel, and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final. Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024, he said, adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan.
"The Germans have told me it will further increase," he said.
Friction is growing in Germany. The Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's center-left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan, are using the dislike of Mr. Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May.
Julianne Smith, a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official, said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party "that stands up to Donald Trump."
"This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump, instead of a referendum on Germany's hollowed-out forces that desperately need these resources," she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump cracked a few jokes about the allegations encircling Joe Biden on Tuesday — the same day as two more women came forward with accusations against the former vice president.
The new allegations, reported by the New York Times, follow the claims of two women who have come forward over the last five days to accuse Biden of unwanted, inappropriate behavior.
Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner on Tuesday, Trump suggested Biden would not pose a threat to him if he entered the 2020 presidential race, thanks to "socialists" working to take him down.
"It looks like the only non-sort-of-heavy socialist, he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists. They got to him. Our former vice president," Trump said. "I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, 'Welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?'"
Trump brought up the former vice president while discussing his reelection theme, asking the audience if he should embrace "Keep America Great" or keep the slogan from his 2016 campaign, "Make America Great Again. "
More: Pelosi says Biden allegations aren't 'disqualifying,' but he needs to understand 'people's space is important'
Later, Trump again mentioned Biden while telling the crowd about a general who told him defeating ISIS could be done within a week. "Give me a kiss," Trump said he told the general.
He continued: "I felt like Joe Biden. "
The Times on Monday night published accounts from two additional women who said Biden's close contact made them feel uncomfortable.
Caitlyn Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault at UNLV in Las Vegas. Caruso, 22, said she was 19 at the time and told the Times that the incident happened after she finished telling her story of an assault.
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told the Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust. ”
Another woman, D. J. Hill, told the Times that in 2012 at a fundraising event in Minneapolis, Biden placed his hand on her back then started dropping it down her back.
Hill, 59, said it made her "very uncomfortable" and told the Times that her husband noticed the incident and intervened by cracking a joke and putting his hand on Biden's shoulder.
"Only he knows his intent," Hill told the Times, adding "If something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it. "
Biden has previously denied any wrongdoing.
"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort," he said Sunday. "And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention. "
'None of us are concerned': How Democrats in early primary states view allegations against Joe Biden
The string of accusations began after Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature, accused Biden of "demeaning and disrespectful" behavior when he allegedly kissed the back of her head.
In a column for New York Magazine, Flores detailed a backstage encounter with Biden during a 2014 event in Nevada where he was speaking to help boost voter turnout for Democrats.
"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified," Flores writes. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. "
On Monday, the Hartford Courant reported Amy Lappos of Connecticut said Biden touched her and rubbed his nose on hers during a 2009 political fundraiser in Greenwich.
"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head," Lappos told the newspaper. "He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth. "

Texto completo: Once a political operative, always a political operative.
How else to explain Phillip Walzak's appearance at a fundraiser for Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, when Walzak shilled for his former boss, Mayor Bill de Blasio?
The New York Times headlined its story on the event, "New York Buzzes Over a Mayor Mulling a 2020 Bid (Buttigieg, Not de Blasio)." Walzak opined to the Times that while presidential candidate Buttigieg had "a compelling story and message," de Blasio "has a real record to run on."
By the way, Walzak has a day job as the NYPD's deputy commissioner for public information. His actions led some at Police Plaza to wonder whether he serves the NYPD or the mayor's political agenda. In response to questions, Walzak emailed this: "Let me ask you this question: is this a topic you have decided to include in your next upcoming column or are you in a consideration period?"
The question of Walzak's priorities is compelling because in the past 40 years or so, the NYPD has prided itself on appearing to be largely free of politics. Because of that, Walzak's appointment a year ago was controversial. PBA president Pat Lynch called it a sign "that the de Blasio administration thinks the NYPD's primary mission is to serve as a political tool ..."
While it is not uncommon for City Hall to select NYPD spokesmen and women, the best of them served the NYPD while remaining in City Hall's good graces.
But the relationship between the NYPD and the de Blasio administration differs from past administrations. While de Blasio has basked in the glow of the city's low crime, many of his actions appear to be critical of NYPD. These include his criticism of a sergeant for fatally shooting an emotionally disturbed woman in the Bronx before an internal investigation was completed, and his attempts to link low crime to his policy of neighborhood policing despite qualitative evidence that it had no more to do with lowering crime than did the NYPD's stop-and-frisk.
The mayor's most successful move was selecting Jim O'Neill as NYPD commissioner. A modest man, O'Neill has proved pliant in acquiescing to mayoral appointments like Walzak.
Recently, O'Neill accepted the appointment of Ernest Hart as deputy commissioner for legal matters after City Hall rejected his two choices. Perhaps Hart's first assignment can be to determine the appropriateness of Walzak's actions.

Texto completo: Donald Trump won the 2016 election last weekend - again.
The professional Trump Haters in Washington, Manhattan and Hollywood are still in full denial mode, though, and they're refusing to accept Special Counsel Robert Mueller's determination that the president and his campaign did not collude with the Russians.
It's sad.
The anti-Trump zealots in the Democrat Party and liberal media have been deluding themselves for two years that Mueller and his lawyers were going to nail Trump on collusion, obstruction or any number of impeachable crimes.
Journalists at the New York Times and the Washington Post swallowed every crazy story the Democrats spun about Trump - and then blared them as fact on their front pages with little or no skepticism.
Meanwhile, MSNBC/CNN's troika of Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and Don Lemon piled on nightly.
In addition to their own left-liberal rants, they paraded out every Trump enemy or ex-Obama team member they could find to call the president a liar, a crook, a tax cheat, a dictator, a traitor, a puppet of Putin...
But the Trump Haters' bubble broke with a huge pop last weekend when Attorney General William Barr reported that Mueller's investigation had found that the president was telling the truth.
"No collusion on Russia was crushing news for the lefties and fake journalists on MSNBC and CNN, the co-flagships of the Fake News fleet.
Maddow and Lemon almost cried on camera, and Matthews was so speechless he couldn't interrupt anyone.
I'd cry too if I were one of those guys.
After two years of being wrong, wrong, wrong about Trump and the Russians, their credentials as pundits or commentators are shot - and apparently even many of their loyal viewers know it.
The large audience of liberals Maddow had built up with her tedious nightly "seminars about Trump's alleged treason dropped by about 20 percent this week - probably because so many distraught viewers are visiting grief counselors.
Maddow and her equally deranged MSNBC colleague "Morning Joe Scarborough are in complete denial.
They are not apologizing for how they and the biased journalists in their political camp got it so wrong about Russian collusion.
Maddow and Scarborough are imitating my own embarrassing Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who claims to know stuff about Trump that Mueller's army of lawyers and investigators could not dig up.
They are now nitpicking Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of the Mueller report and hinting of an even bigger conspiracy.
Meanwhile, President Trump has the last laugh - a big one - and he now has the high political ground.
He's already embarked on a "No Collusion victory tour in the Midwest and his chances are looking better than ever for reelection in 2020.
Without collusion and obstruction, the Democrats have no major issues left to attack President Trump.
The economy is still doing great. Unemployment among blacks, Latinos and women is at all-time lows. Incomes and wages are going up.
The Democrats' new socialist ideas - Medicare for all, free college tuition and the silly Green New Deal - are impossible dreams that can never be paid for.
So all they really have is collusion, obstruction and impeachment, which is why we'll be seeing Mueller and Barr dragged into the House of Representatives to be interrogated by Schiff and his fellow desperate Democrats.
Democrats, like Maddow, Morning Joe and Lemon, have always believed Robert Mueller was going to come in and give them the game-winning TD they needed to finally defeat Trump.
But thanks to the Mueller report, all they can do now is throw Hail Marys into the end zone and pray that Mueller or Bill Barr will be called for pass interference.

Burger King’s Whopper gets an Impossible version

Texto completo: Burger King has begun testing an Impossible Whopper in 59 St. Louis restaurants with an eye to rolling out the plant-based protein option to all of its U.S. locations.
If Burger King’s partnership with Impossible Foods expands, it would be a coup for the Bay Area company that’s dedicated to “making meat using plants.” Burger King is in the top 10 largest fast food chains, frequently listed at No. 6.
Impossible Foods has captured diners’ attention with its signature product, the Impossible Burger, which it markets as being as tasty as beef and requiring far less land, water and other natural resources to produce.
It’s aimed at flexitarians, people who like meat but want to cut down on their consumption for ethical or health reasons.
Impossible Foods also markets itself as a tech company and created a stir last January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with the debut of its Impossible Burger 2.0.
Among the improvements to the product was making it hold together better on grills, thus making it easier for restaurants that flame-broil burgers to serve it.
Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods’ main competitor, announced a partnership with Carl’s Jr. for its Famous Star, placing its Beyond Burger in 3,800 restaurants. Del Taco is moving forward with Beyond Tacos.
Plant-based meats typically cost more than beef, about $2 more at Carl’s Jr. Burger King did not announce the price of its Impossible Whopper in St. Louis but released a video of Whopper lovers proclaiming that they can’t tell the difference.
Burger King is considering a rapid rollout of the Impossible Whopper to 7,200 U.S. restaurants, according to the New York Times. Company representatives affirmed it’s a possibility.
Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper on April Fool’s Day, but in a news release said the Whopper is real and the news is not a whopper.
The Impossible Burger is currently available in more than 5,000 U.S. restaurants, according to the news release. That’s a lot of growth since April 2018, when the Impossible Burger was something of a novelty at events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Most national chains that serve the Impossible Burger are casual restaurants rather than fast food chains. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews added it to its menu on April 1 as an option for any of its burgers. With more than 570 restaurants in the United States and Canada, it claims to be the largest chain currently serving it.

Biden, on defensive, admits acts of 'affection'

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden, under pressure to respond to allegations that he touched and kissed a former Nevada assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, went on the defensive Sunday morning with a sweeping statement saying he did not believe he acted inappropriately but acknowledging that he had made “expressions of affection" during his years on the campaign trail.
In his statement, he emphasized that “not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately" but pledged to listen to any accuser. He did not describe in detail the “expressions of affection," but said there were also “countless handshakes, hugs," and attempts to “support and comfort" people he met.
“I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear," Biden said. “But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will."
Biden, who is expected to announce soon whether he will join the 2020 Democratic primary field, issued his statement two days after an essay by Flores was published in New York Magazine's The Cut. Flores, a Democrat, said she was 35 at the time of her encounter with Biden, who was then vice president.
Biden, she wrote, had come to a rally to help her campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her, touched her, and planted “a big slow kiss" on the back of her head.
On Sunday, Flores said she was glad the former vice president was willing to listen and clarify his intentions. But she found it hard to believe that Biden could not have been aware of how he made her feel.

Fox News host apologizes for 'Mexican Countries' graphic
"We want to clarify and correct something that happened earlier in the show," Ed Henry, host of "Fox & Friends," said Sunday. "We had an inaccurate graphic on screen while talking about this very story. We just want to be clear, the funding is being cut off to the three Central American countries. We apologize for the error."
"Fox & Friends" had just reported news of President Trump's plans to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to three Central American countries over the flow of migrants to the US-Mexico border.
As Henry talked about the president "going full-court press on Mexico" and cohost Pete Hegseth spoke of "cutting payments, aid payments, to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras," a chyron — the caption superimposed over the video — characterized it slightly differently. It referred to them as "3 Mexican Countries."
Henry later apologized for the chyron, saying that "it never should have happened."
Washington Post
Republicans 'working on a plan' to replace Obamacare
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that Republicans are "working on a plan" for replacing the Affordable Care Act, days after President Trump surprised members on both sides of the aisle when he declared that the GOP "will soon be known as the party of health care."
On "Fox News Sunday," Conway told Chris Wallace that "the Republican plan is manifold." But she did not provide specifics. "We've been working on a plan for a long time," she said. “And we hope that Congress would come along."
Senate Republicans have said the White House would need to make the first move by putting forward its own proposal. But administration officials have said that nothing firm is in the works.

Texto completo: Baseball's annual rite of literary passage each spring is never shy of more rewrites.
To get a clear read on why book publishers put on their straw hat and usher back Major League Baseball with dozens of new titles, note that all sorts of revisionist history, personality-driven essays or bios that exhume new previously untold info resonate best with those who've endured a long, cold winter.
Same with anything that takes good-natured digs to keep America's Pastime as part of the pop culture conversation.

For example:
* "Inside the Empire: The True Power Behind the New York Yankees," by Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28, 256 pages, released March 26).
A couple crafty reporters with Rolling Stone credentials cultivate a lot of off-the-record info as sourced quotes to clarify how general manager Brian Cashman really is smarter than he looks and Hal Steinbrenner far less antagonistic than his father. Amazon already has it as the No. 1 bestseller in the category of "Sociology of Sports." This is what "The Best Team Money Can Buy," a fluff piece on the Dodgers and its new ownership in 2015, should have aspired to be.
* "They Bled Blue: The 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers -- Fernandomania, Strike-Season Mayhem and the Weirdest Championship Baseball Had Ever Seen," by Jason Turbow (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26, 384 pages, to be released June 4).
Turbow admits "it might not benefit my credibility as the author of this book to admit that I am a lifelong Giants partisan, but it's true." Which explains why the first line from the first chapter reads: "Tommy Lasorda was always a shill."
Eventually, you figure out Turbow admired how these Dodgers flourished during abnormal circumstances as management was ready to trade off most of their star-studded roster from those '70s teams a year (or three) too early amid interpersonal conflicts.
Lots of memories squeezed out of Steve Garvey, Jerry Reuss, Ron Cey and Rick Monday, but nothing new from Lasorda or Fernando Valenzuela.
* "Baseball Card Vandals: Over 200 Decent Jokes on Worthless Cards!" by Beau and Bryan Abbott (Chronicle Books, $18.95, 224 pages, released March 5)
Two Culver City-based guys calling themselves "artistically-inclined weirdos" have created a following at www.BaseballCardVandals.com, so a book spinoff is kind of natural. They didn't throw away their old common cards as kids, but instead experimented on them through the fumes of Sharpies, Wite-Out and glue sticks with name and word play. It belongs shelved in the humor section of bookstores, snickering across the aisle at the stodgy baseball hardbounds.
* "Baseball Epic: Famous and Forgotten Lives of the Dead Ball Era," by Jason Novak (Coffee House Press, $16.95, 240 pages, to be released Tuesday).
Tales of a bygone time are brought to a modern swipe-right storytelling process by an illustrator who matches up Twitter-sized folklore with his own cave drawings. We're left with a Schadenfreude spit-take of history that includes names like Ping Bodie, a Yankees teammate of Babe Ruth, who "once won a spaghetti-eating contest against an ostrich" and "was also kicked out of a movie theater for disruptive laughter during a drama." Draw your own conclusions.
* "K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches," by Tyler Kepner (Doubleday, $28.95, 320 pages, to be released Tuesday).
Fastball, curveball. Changeup, cutter. Splitter, sinker, slider and screwball. Knuckleball. Spitball? All but the last remain legal tender as Kepner, the pitch-perfect New York Times writer, goes deep with those who made a living perfecting them.
A must read for broadcasters who lazily resort to just saying "fastball" or "off-speed" because they have no clue.
* "Reclaiming 42: Public Memory and the Reframing of Jackie Robinson's Radical Legacy," by David Naze (University of Nebraska Press, $45, 234 pages, to be released June 1).
The author's intent is to make sure Robinson's life isn't marginalized by an MLB "simplistic narrative." He also wants to specifically examine how Robinson's life has "been constructed by a mainstream, white and male perspective." Not to complicate this, but Naze admits he's viewing this all "through the lens of a rhetorical scholar who comes from an admittedly privileged, white, male perspective."
* "Let's Play Two: The Legend of Mr. Cub, The Life of Ernie Banks," by Ron Rapoport (Hachette Books, $28, 464 pages, released March 26).
Rapoport's years of rapport with Banks manifests itself in the completion of a previously unfinished project, now much richer than the original intent because of updated perspective. In his acknowledgements, Rapoport, a former L.A. Times and L.A. Daily News columnist, writes that those who helped him finish this knew Banks as a "joyful, melancholy, humble, complicated, companionable, lonely man ... [who] remained imprisoned in an image of one simplistic dimension." It's an odd coincidence that another Banks bio with a similar title is also out now, by Doug Wilson. Rapoport has a much better launch angle.
* "108 Stitches: Loose Threads, Ripping Yarns and the Darndest Characters From My Time in the Game," by Ron Darling (St. Martin's Press, 272 pages, $29.99, to be released Tuesday).
The current TBS analyst says the way today's game goes, he can "envision a scenario where we'll see a manager with absolutely no playing experience. ... Hey, in this era of driverless cars, Google might even come up with a model for a manager-less team!" It's a darling premise you read here first.
* "The Game of Eating Smart: Nourishing Recipes for Peak Performance Inspired by MLB Superstars," by Julie Loria with chef Allen Campbell (Rodale Books, $25.99, 240 pages, released March 26).
Clayton Kershaw's recipe for success: Blue cinnamon smoothies with unsweetened almond milk, breakfast bowls with white quinoa and hemp hearts and a salmon nori roll held together with creamy avocado.
Why Mike Trout isn't big on fish is the real foodie mystery. He also claims aloe-fortified coconut water "helps to maintain the proper balance of alkalinity in your body."
More books like this and the MLB will have to impose a celery cap.
--
Tune it in
* As much as it sparked discussion about the exploitation of amateur athletics, CBS' decision to admit it has dedicated a camera and extra equipment to focus on Duke star freshman Zion Williamson during the NCAA men's college basketball tournament shouldn't be lambasted.
It is hardly out of the ordinary for any network to do such a thing when covering a major sports championship. We also challenge anyone to show how it has been an obviously over-utilized tool during these last two weeks of coverage.
The flip side would be if Williamson blew out another shoe or reinjured himself, and CBS' array of cameras somehow missed it because it happened away from a play. For the upcoming Final Four, watch the "Magic Johnson Cam" come into play.
* Is Tony Romo worth eight figures a year to stay in CBS' NFL top broadcast game booth? Absolutely. And CBS should get first crack at paying it.
The Sporting News reports the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback will ask for that in a contract extension in 2020. He makes $4 million a year currently, which is about half of what Troy Aikman reportedly gets from Fox in the same position.
--
Tune it out
* After a couple years of experimentation leading to consumer angst over exclusivity and technical glitches, Major League Baseball and Facebook will drastically reduce their 2019 rights deal to have only six national live streams -- one a month -- and they are subject to be blacked out in local markets.
There were 26 live MLB Facebook streams last year, mostly midweek day games, and all but one was exclusive to the platform. That circumvented several Dodgers' SportsNet LA and Angels' Fox Sports West shows with often glitch-filled episodes and strange broadcast teams. The 2019 schedule has yet to be announced. The agreement was first reported by MorningConsult.com.
* The next insightful comment from one-time USC head coach Henry Bibby (last coached there in 2005), on the KCBS-Channel 2 NCAA postgame set with Jim Hill, will be his first.

Unlocking rural economy requires different keys

Texto completo: Of all the places you would expect to see a fight between the cold, hard face of ag economics and the warm, tender heart of rural America, that place would not be the corner of West 41st St. and Eighth Avenue in New York City, the home of the New York Times.
And yet there it was in late March, two of the nation's column-writing heavyweights slugging it out - as much as verb-slingers slug at all -o n the world's most prestigious opinion page.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman threw the first punch with a March 18 column titled "Getting Real About Rural America." In it, he noted that rural America's deepening economic woe is, "in some cases," the result of "powerful forces ... that nobody knows how to reverse ..."
Krugman is being kind. He knows these powerful forces - like trade-centered farm bills, corporately integrated meat production, the unchallenged growth of the Farm Credit System - drive today's rural economy.
Without change, however, he sees continuing rural woe because, "We can't help rural America without understanding that the role it used to play in our nation is being undermined by powerful economic forces that nobody knows how to stop."
In fact, most ag leaders have little interest in stopping any of these "forces" even if they could. The reason is as old as they are: When commodity prices are good, Big Ag wins big; when commodity prices are poor, Big Ag still wins, just not as big.
Twitter exploded in rage over Krugman's analysis; he was called every barnyard name there is and was urged, impolitely, not to fret (or write) about the future of rural America again.
Three days later, another Times' columnist, David Brooks, wrote a rebuttal to Krugman's dark portrait. Its premise was in its warm title, "What Rural America Has to Teach Us."
"Everybody says rural America is collapsing," began Brooks. "But I keep going to places with more moral coherence and social commitment than we have in booming urban areas. These visits prompt the same question: How can we spread the civic mind-set they have in abundance?"
Brooks cited several examples of this "mind-set" he encountered during a recent visit to McCook and Grand Island, Neb., where "nearly everyone is working at something," "people leave their homes and cars unlocked," and "crime is low."
The rosy portrait fueled Twitter acclaim for Brooks, and, unlike Krugman, he's welcome to come back and write about rural America anytime.
Overall, however, Times readers' reactions were just the opposite. Of the 1,867 written comments the newspaper received on Krugman's column, most offered personal facts to confirm his view that rural America is now a tough place to find jobs, health care, education, and, in the end, any kind of a prosperous future.
Surprisingly, many of Brooks' 1,473 commenters cited the same hard facts in their responses. Hundreds of city-dwelling rural refugees noted that Brooks was right about rural neighborliness and civic engagement. But, they added, he never mentioned that rural America is pockmarked with dissolving or merging school districts, shrinking medical choices and closing hospitals, few high-paying jobs and an opioid epidemic.
More fascinating to me, both a rural dweller and New York Times subscriber, is that while rural America was debating the two New York Times' opinion pieces, the Trump administration was pushing deep budget cuts to almost every federal program that rural America has grown increasingly dependent upon - like food aid, Medicare, Medicaid and crop insurance.
Indeed, on March 11, the White House proposed to slash the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2020 budget by 15 percent. Various farm policy leaders allied to the White House immediately dismissed the proposal. Don't worry, they explained, the White House isn't serious.
Not serious? Why then waste taxpayer money writing, printing and distributing what is, essentially, a joke?
The most logical answer is that it's not a joke; the budget proposal is a clear indication what the White House would do to rural programs if it had the Constitutional authority to do so.
That overreach should worry rural Americans a great deal more than whether we leave our homes and cars unlocked.

Joe Biden says he did not act inappropriately with Lucy Flores

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden, under pressure to respond to allegations that he touched and kissed a former Nevada assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, went on the defensive Sunday morning with a sweeping statement saying he did not believe he acted inappropriately but acknowledging that he had made “expressions of affection" during his years on the campaign trail.
In his statement, he emphasized that “not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately" but pledged to listen to any accuser. He did not describe in detail the “expressions of affection," but said there were also “countless handshakes, hugs," and attempts to “support and comfort" people he met.
“I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear," Biden said. “But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will."
Biden, who is expected to announce soon whether he will join the 2020 Democratic primary field, issued his statement two days after an essay by Flores was published in New York Magazine's The Cut. Flores, a Democrat, said she was 35 at the time of her encounter with Biden, who was then vice president.
Biden, she wrote, had come to a rally to help her campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her, touched her, and planted “a big slow kiss" on the back of her head.
On Sunday, Flores said she was glad the former vice president was willing to listen and clarify his intentions. But she found it hard to believe that Biden could not have been aware of how he made her feel.

Fox News host apologizes for 'Mexican Countries' graphic
"We want to clarify and correct something that happened earlier in the show," Ed Henry, host of "Fox & Friends," said Sunday. "We had an inaccurate graphic on screen while talking about this very story. We just want to be clear, the funding is being cut off to the three Central American countries. We apologize for the error."
"Fox & Friends" had just reported news of President Trump's plans to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to three Central American countries over the flow of migrants to the US-Mexico border.
As Henry talked about the president "going full-court press on Mexico" and co-host Pete Hegseth spoke of "cutting payments, aid payments, to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras," a chyron — the caption superimposed over the video — characterized it slightly differently. It referred to them as "3 Mexican Countries."
Henry later apologized for the chyron, saying that "it never should have happened."

Republicans 'working on a plan' to replace Obamacare
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that Republicans are "working on a plan" for replacing the Affordable Care Act, days after President Trump surprised members on both sides of the aisle when he declared that the GOP "will soon be known as the party of health care."
On "Fox News Sunday," Conway told Chris Wallace that "the Republican plan is manifold." But she did not provide specifics. "We've been working on a plan for a long time," she said. “And we hope that Congress would come along."
Senate Republicans have said the White House would need to make the first move by putting forward its own proposal. But administration officials have said that nothing firm is in the works.

Apple News+: Are 300 magazines worth $9.99 a month?

Texto completo: For a journalism junkie, the 300-some magazines that Apple News+ will let you read for 10 bucks is a great deal. Especially when you also throw in the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star.
But finding what you want to read could be a smoother experience, and there’s still a fair bit of confusion about some of the content that will – or won’t – be included.
Apple News+, of course, is the new paid tier of the company’s curated news service that CEO Tim Cook announced this week. By Apple’s measure, subscribing to all these publications individually would set you back more than $8,000 a year.
Face it, none of you reading this is ever going to subscribe to anything near that number, not even a doctor’s office. What you will discover, though, is an eclectic mix of periodicals that Apple promises you can consume cover to cover. And there’s plenty here to justify your subscription.
What you can read
The wide-ranging list of publications includes: The New Yorker, New York Magazine, Time, Newsweek, The Atlantic, People, Fortune, Fast Company, Sports Illustrated, Vogue, National Geographic, Wired, Popular Science, Rolling Stone, Car and Driver, Parents, Essence, Marie Claire, Travel and Leisure, Vanity Fair and Entertainment Weekly, and too many more to mention.
Online-only outlets are also represented, including theSkimm, The Highlight by Vox, Vulture, and Extra Crunch from Tech Crunch.
The new service is based on Texture, a digital newsstand app Apple acquired about a year ago and that has been referred to as a “Netflix of news. ”
What’s more, the $9. 99 monthly sum also lets members of your family (up to six) read their own favorite periodicals through that single subscription. And you can try the first month of News+ for free.

Not every major publisher is taking part. Among the missing are The New York Times and Washington Post, which both have thriving digital operations behind paywalls. News+ is also light on local news.
And some readers, quite frankly, may be satisfied with all the content you can already read gratis through the free version of Apple News, not to mention elsewhere online. It’s hard-enough finding the time to read everything you want to get to. Others will view this like cable TV: Why pay for publications you have no intention of ever reading?
The free version of Apple News already gives you a lot to consume, including stories from USA TODAY and other publications that don’t charge for digital access. Even among publications that do charge, you can typically read a set number of articles for free.
A separate My Magazines section shows the covers of magazines you have shown you’re interested in. By tapping a magazine cover, you can dive into the issue, which is designed for the phone or tablet experience with the publication’s familiar typography and photography.
In a few cases, those magazine covers come alive, moving just like the Live Photos images on an iPhone.
One article I came across in Vanity Fair, included video of Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph driving in a convertible – I imagine there will be more and more video sprinkled across various publications over time.
For now, the ads are not interactive; it’ll be interesting to see if Apple and its partners go that route.
And yes, magazines can be downloaded to read offline.
Many of today’s readers, especially younger readers, may be less devoted to a given publication and more interested in the topic areas and subjects covered across numerous publications. Articles that News+ grouped under Fashion, for example, came from Elle, Bazaar and Shape.
“People in the News” articles came from Fortune, People, Time and Billboard.
“What millennials value is convenience and the ability to hit one native application and be able to browse multiple publications in one user experience,” says Joseph Anthony, founder of Hero Traveler, a travel-focused social media platform. “Millennials have grown up as part of this highlight generation. ”
I appreciate stumbling on material I might not otherwise come across just like the next person. But as a traditional magazine reader, I like going to a familiar publication and digesting what is there. For $9. 99, you get an awful lot to digest.
The company bases recommended reading material through a combination of human curators and “on-device intelligence. ”
Some publishers will let you access some past content as a News+ subscriber.
If you read the Wall Street Journal inside News+, for example, all of the articles in the paper will be made available and searchable for three days, a Journal spokesperson said.
The Journal’s channel within Apple News+ features general interest content and top stories and opinions daily that have been curated by a Journal editorial team.
But Apple News+ subscribers will not get other Dow Jones products, such as the Dow Jones Newswires, or content targeted to professional markets (for example, WSJ Pro, CFO Journal, CMO Today). Journal newsletters, market data, video and audio content, are also not included.
Indeed, the key question to ask if you are already paying for a digital publication that is now lumped into the News+ subscription is why keep doing so?
A regular all-access digital subscription to the Journal costs $38. 99 plus tax.
The onus is on the publication to make the case.
I pay $5. 99 a month (or $59. 99 a year) for digital access to The New Yorker. Why continue? The New Yorker’s pitch is that while subscribing under Apple News+ gets you all the articles and cartoons that appear in the weekly print magazine, the New Yorker publishes 10 to 15 articles daily online that you won’t be able to read, notably many breaking investigative pieces. Nor will you be able to access the New Yorker crossword or the publication’s newsletters.
Apple isn’t saying, but the company reportedly asks publishers for a 50 percent cut of subscription revenues, more than the 30 percent it typically takes for App Store purchases.
It’s no secret that magazine and newspaper publishers have had a really tough go of it, which helps explain their willingness to play ball with Apple despite what appear to be onerous terms. Publishers are counting on gaining a lot more subscribers through Apple rather than losing the ones they already have.

When Sky &amp; Telescope Had No Limit

Texto completo: In the spring of 1976, nearly broke, struggling with a novel and having exhausted the patience of everyone around me, I wrote a letter begging for some kind of job to every publisher listed in the Boston Yellow Pages. I had a physics degree from MIT, but I didn’t want to be a physicist anymore; I had decided I was a writer.
I wound up landing a part-time job at a small monthly magazine called Sky & Telescope, a venerable bible of astronomers and amateur telescope makers, as an assistant typesetter, for $6 an hour. On my first day, as I was entering, the magazine’s founder, Charles Federer Jr., met me on the sidewalk and warned me not to tell my new colleagues how much I was making. The company would never give me such an exorbitant salary on a full-time basis, he said.
This was true; when I was hired full time six months later, I had to take a cut in hourly pay. I learned that my co-workers had been calling me the six-dollars-an-hour man behind my back.
That was my first job in journalism. Four years later, I left for a job in New York, with tears in my eyes.
The small Sky & Telescope staff was like a family, with all the good and bad that implies - a handful of backyard stargazers and space fans who care enough about the sky to work for, well, see above. We all did it all: wrote and edited stories, took pictures, drew artwork and laid out the pages. It was at Sky & Telescope that I met Stephen Hawking and commenced a lifetime of writing about black holes, but one of my other jobs was typing up the advertising bills and sending them out each month.
My years there were the journalistic equivalent of growing up on the family farm, where you learned to do everything.
Bad news
So I was crestfallen to hear recently that the family farm was up for sale. The news broke on Hastro-L, a mailing list devoted to the history of astronomy. Forbes had reported that corporate behemoth F+W Media had filed for bankruptcy and would have to sell off its properties, including Sky & Telescope.
Word reverberated through the astronomical community, amid rumors that the magazine might close or become an online-only publication.
Peter Tyson, the editor-in-chief, confirmed that Sky & Telescope was indeed for sale, but he was not worried. The magazine was financially strong, he said, but had been dragged down by the financial misadventures of its parent company.
“I have every confidence that it will survive this rough patch,” he said.
I have to believe he is right, and not just out of shameless sentiment or because I have relied on S&T, as it is familiarly known, over the years for straight talk about the heavens and the gritty details about how telescopes and other gadgets by which astronomers observe the sky are made. In its singular way, S&T is treading the same dark path that many publications, including The New York Times, have been traveling lately.
In 1980 I left Sky & Telescope to join Discover, Time Inc.’s entry in a wave of popular-science magazines that arose in the late 1970s and early ’80s. Those were heady times for me, my colleagues and our competitors, but that wave soon crashed for lack of advertising. By the ’90s, most of Discover’s competitors were gone, and many newspapers had discontinued their stand-alone science sections.
The carnage continues as the internet erodes the classic business model in which advertising pays the freight for publishers. So far this year, some 2,300 media jobs have been lost, including at BuzzFeed, once a darling of digital-media mavens.
Sky & Telescope, aimed at an audience of hobbyists and armchair astronauts, was founded by Federer and his wife, Helen Spence Federer, in 1941, by combining a pair of existing publications: The Sky, published by the American Museum of Natural History, and The Telescope, out of Harvard College Observatory. “We’ve never missed an issue, and don’t intend to,” Charles Tyson, who has edited the magazine since 2014, told me.
Right from the source
Many of the articles in Sky & Telescope are written by professional astronomers and so bear a stamp of authority. My editor, Joseph Ashbrook, who had a Ph.D. from Harvard, treated each word in every issue as a reflection of his own professional probity. A mistake, real or perceived, in my copy could transform him into a sputtering tower of frustration, after which he would retreat to his office and run my story through his typewriter, while I sat outside at my own desk listening for the clatter of his keys.
Later in my career, the fact that I had worked at Sky & Telescope often gave me credibility with older astronomers still uneasy about the mainstream media. It is the kind of magazine that readers hoard for eternity in giant stacks in the attic, selling and trading back issues.
Except for a couple of years in the early 2000s, Sky & Telescope has always been profitable, and it remains so, Tyson said. The company has expanded to publish Night Sky magazine for beginners, books, star atlases and other products, and to run eclipse and other adventure tours. In December 2020, the magazine is offering a 23-day eclipse cruise around South America and Antarctica with astronaut John Grunsfeld, who helped repair the Hubble Telescope in 2009.
In 1993, the magazine announced a contest to come up with another name for the beginning of the universe: The phrase “Big Bang” was “misleading, trivializing and inappropriately bellicose,” wrote Timothy Ferris, who proposed the contest and served as one of its judges. After perusing the entries - 13,099 of them, from people ranging in age from 4 to 92 - the judges concluded essentially that “Big Bang” was the worst name for the origin of everything, except for every other name.
But Sky & Telescope has dwindled, from a circulation of 132,000 and a typical size of 168 pages in 2000, to about 55,000 and 86 pages recently, according to Rick Fienberg, who edited the magazine for 22 years and is now the spokesman for the American Astronomical Society.
“There’s simply not enough pages to do everything that S&T used to do, such as publish book reviews every month,” he said in an email.
For all that, there is little evidence that interest in cosmic affairs has lessened. Tyson said traffic to Sky & Telescope’s website had doubled over the past decade and now stands at about 500,000 page views a month.
Sky Publishing was owned by its staff until 2006, when it sold itself to New Track Media LLC, which in turn was taken over in 2014 by F+W Media, one of the nation’s largest publishers of hobbyist media. In early March, however, F+W filed for bankruptcy as a result of what Forbes called “a perfect storm of secular industry decline, poor investments, and even mismanagement.”
What, and who, happens next to Sky & Telescope depends on F+W, and likely will be decided this summer. Greg Osberg, the company’s CEO, called S&T “a well-performing account” that already had attracted interest. There will be an auction in late May or early June for the magazine and its various streams of revenue. “It’s worth a lot,” Osberg said.
That sentiment was shared by Tyson: “I think we’re a bargain.” He added, “We are entirely confident that Sky & Telescope will survive - maybe not unscathed, but for another 75 years.”
Which would be good news for the starhuggers among us. Take it from an old six-dollars-an-hour man.

Texto completo: At least the Special Olympics are safe. For now. Government support for the almost universally beloved organization – dedicated to providing athletic opportunities for individuals over age 8 with intellectual disabilities – seemed to be suddenly smack in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's budget cutters.

Or it was until members of Congress jumped all over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos – whose chief qualifications for her job are her stupendous wealth, said to be at least $1 billion, and her loathing of all public education – for her plan to strip away the relatively modest subsidy we taxpayers give the nonprofit organization each year.
That would be $17.6 million. Or, put another way, what our government now pays for about five trips to Mar-a-Lago for the Trump entourage.
The outrage in the land was immediate. It even penetrated the walls of the White House, and Donald himself strode out to proclaim that the Special Olympics forevermore – or at least for the next year – would be secure.
That was just after the president had griped to Senate Republicans that Puerto Rico – ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017, killing close to 3,000 people and destroying much of the island's infrastructure – was getting way too much money for disaster relief. He wants it stopped, doggone it.
Maybe his gripe should more profitably be directed to the weather gods, not the Congress.
Anyway, it's been a busy week in Trump World.
Our president took a few minutes midweek to demand that reporters stop covering congressional Democrats (and Trump critics) Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff because “they're liars.” That's rich, coming from someone the Washington Post, as of Feb. 17, had actually documented as telling 8,718 “false or misleading” statements – lies – since the start of his then 759-day-old presidency.
And he stopped twice in two days to denounce Washington lawyer George T. Conway, first as a “total loser” and, the next day in a tweet, as a “stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!”
His pique might be understandable. Conway had been sniping at him for months and in recent days ramped up the criticism, questioning Trump's mental health and describing the president as fitting the clinical definition of someone with a narcissistic personality disorder. He told the New York Times he found “thoroughly maddening … the utter incompetence and mendacity of the president and administration.”
This would, of course, be of little interest to most Americans if critic Conway were not the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of the president's most trusted top aides.
At the very least all of this gives those of us in the hinterlands a fascinating glimpse into power marriages, GOP style.
But the highlight of this week's adventures in Trump Land came early in the week when the president grandly declared that the Republicans would become “the party of health care” and, at the same time, his administration unexpectedly asked a federal court to strike down as unconstitutional the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – in its entirety. With no replacement in sight.
This would mean, of course, the end of any affordable insurance protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions or coverage of young people up to age 26 on their parents' policies and would leave insurers free to resume charging older, sicker people higher premiums than they now pay.
All are provisions of the loathed Obamacare that people suddenly love and that Trump and congressional Republicans pledged repeatedly in their election campaigns to protect and preserve.
It's the latest move in Trump's bizarre dance with health care in recent years.
In October 2016, candidate Trump declared, “You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost. And it's going to be so easy.”
In February 2017, newly inaugurated President Trump sounded a bit baffled. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”
But by this March 2019, “I understand health care now especially well,” quick learner Trump bragged.
In fact, health care in 2019 amounted to 17.8 percent of our country's GNP – significantly higher than virtually any other developed country, most of which spend at most half that much and all of which can point to health outcomes as good as or higher than those in the U.S.A.
Since the passage of the ACA, our national cost has at least plateaued and even fractionally declined. Now, though, by asking a court to throw the ACA out entirely – with nothing to replace it – Trump's administration would throw a fifth of our economy into total chaos.
“This is bonkers,” a Washington Post editorial forthrightly declared.
It is. Let's remember that the ACA – Obamacare – became law in 2010 and has been in effect for nine years. It is thoroughly woven into the fabric of our health care economy. It is a complex, sprawling law that, the Post reminds us, has brought about huge (and mostly welcome) changes in Medicare, Medicaid, hospital and provider regulation, and general public health care policy. It has provided an expanded Medicaid program that extended coverage to nearly 20 million uninsured Americans.
And – in addition – Obamacare is now genuinely popular, including even among lots of Trump's people. More than half of voters now hold a favorable opinion of the law, and even more like a lot of the individual provisions Trump's repeal would dump.
Support for repealing the law altogether has plummeted as people have become familiar with its benefits. And at least until this week the Republican Party seemed to agree, muting the once incessant cries for its repeal.
Which means that Trump's move to scrap the law altogether is – to put it mildly – a head-scratcher for a lot of people.
After all, some of us – well, okay, I – would much prefer to dwell on the question of whether Market Basket is haunted. At least the Market Basket in Wilmington, Mass., where several shoppers swear they've seen the specter of a Victorian lady – in her nightgown, no less! – hovering over the frozen peas.
And, finally, we should all rejoice that there is one thing both Democrats and Republicans have found they can agree on in this polarized country: Lawyer Michael Avenatti really is a world-class skunk and sleazeball.

Why did the world forget?

Texto completo: Columbine. Newtown. Fort Hood. Aurora. Charleston. Virginia Tech. Mass shooting locations read off with chilling familiarity. Missing and almost forgotten among the communities that have suffered through the bloodshed is Binghamton.
What factors may have led many to forget the ACA shootings Not that the community wants to be solely identified by its own active shooter at an immigrant center that claimed the life of 13 victims 10 years ago.
But with each subsequent mass shooting, it seems the shocking incident that gripped this community in fear and mourning on a rainy and chilly Friday morning fades further from the nation's collective memory, creating a double tragedy for the innocent, many of whom were foreign nationals in an English class.
"The narrative of the story did not resonate with the mainstream," said Angie Chuang, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who has studied the media reaction to Binghamton's mass murder. "It was very much a perception of immigrants killing other immigrants."
Eleven of the 13 victims were from distant locales — China, Haiti and Iraq among them. Many of the mourning kin were out of reach for media interviews in the days following the shooting. Days after the Front Street scene was wiped clean, so was the searing impact of what was then one of the deadliest mass shootings in America — at least, in the eyes of the nation.
"I know a lot was said, maybe because they were immigrants, people didn't care as much," said Dr. Jeffrey King, son of Roberta "Bobbie" King, the beloved teacher who was targeted in the English as Second Language class. "I'm not so sure about that. I think it got diluted down as well because all of a sudden, (mass shootings) were happening every several months almost, a couple a year."
The American Civic Association killings were the seventh-deadliest shooting in U.S. history at the time, the same as Columbine High School. Today, it remains the 13th-deadliest mass shooting.
Each time a mass shooting occurs, media and politicians tick off a list of previous deadly killings, using shorthand like "Parkland" and "Aurora" to represent the horrors that occurred there. Binghamton is nearly always left off that list. The slight has mostly gone unnoticed beyond Binghamton, with one notable exception: Four years ago, The Boston Globe ran a front-page story headlined, "The deadliest mass shooting everyone forgot."
"In response to the shootings in San Bernardino, the New York Times published a historic op-ed titled 'End The Gun Epidemic In America' on its front page. It referenced, among others, the mass shootings in Colorado, Oregon and Charleston. It made no mention of Binghamton. Neither did editorials on gun violence in the Washington Post, L.A. Times and other major outlets," the Boston Globe writer observed.
Memories last long in Binghamton. The lives lost still bring a collective sting to longtime residents and relatives.
"At first, we started to realize, a few years out, after more and more shootings, all these articles were (saying), 'Oh, Columbine,' then Virginia Tech and Fort Hood and all this, and we're like, 'Wow, where are we?" King said. "We were one of the largest massacres at the time, you know — 13 people killed and others injured. And it actually really was very insulting, I mean, I was furious."
Barely 24 hours after shots rang out on April 3, 2009, at the American Civic Association, a horde of national media descended onto Binghamton to cover one of nation's most deadly mass shootings.
How the news may have influenced what's remembered National television networks and media outlets sprang into action, dispatching crews to bring news of the latest shooting tragedy to their viewers and readers. All the biggies were there: ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN.
"Today" show reporters set up a temporary canopy just across the street from the ACA to update its audience on the latest developments on the morning following the shooting. Random residents were plucked off the street for reaction.
A crush of media attended the day-after news conference at City Hall, where then-Binghamton Mayor Matt Ryan spoke about the tragedy and Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski described the ugly scene.
Within a few days, the media gaggle dispersed, moving on to other stories. Out of the spotlight, Binghamton's hurt became just one of several.
"The bigger issue is that outside the central New York area, Binghamton was never a high news draw," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University College at Oswego, who studies mass shootings.
For America, the killings had become all too commonplace. The media's mass shooting drill was well-oiled. In the 10 years prior, there had been 13 mass shootings — Columbine and Virginia Tech among them — across the nation, claiming the lives of 116 and injuring 105.
If Binghamton wasn't eclipsed because of its size, then why? Since Binghamton, there have been 26 more active-shooter incidents in America. The death toll, 281; injured, 243. Several of those locations stand out, too: Tucson, San Bernardino, Orlando, Fort Hood, Newtown and Charleston.
Binghamton has become little more than a footnote.
"These were poor immigrants in a poor town that had a Rust Belt vibe," said Chuang, trying to explain why the memory of Binghamton's tragedy has faded. "These were people that were affected — they've dealt with hardship before."
Once the immediacy of the tragedy fades, so does the collective attention of the American public.
"It's very easy for society to turn a blind eye because it's not their community," Schildkraut said.
After a decade, Zikuski is at a loss to explain how the American Civic Association seemingly became forgotten in the national conversation of mass shootings.
When looking at other shootings, back to Columbine, it's not as though Binghamton became eclipsed because of its size or even the number of victims.
"Do I agree with that? Yes, I do, it is sort of like the 'forgotten massacre,'" Zikuski said. "Not that we want to be known for this — this is one of the most tragic things that's happened in this community."
Zikuski said he hopes the fact that the American Civic Association involved an immigrant population didn't push it out of the national spotlight. But, he said, that's seemingly the most obvious explanation.
But perhaps more important than being ranked among the nation's mass shootings is being known for how the community healed, he said.
"I think this community took it hard, so I certainly don't think it was any less tragic because of who got shot," Zikuski said.
"Nobody wants to be known for what happened here, but they don't want it forgotten. People want people to know this community pulled together."

Marijuana edibles may pose special risks

Texto completo: Pot brownies and other cannabis "edibles" like gummy bears that are sold online and where marijuana is legal may seem like harmless fun, but new research indicates that edibles may be more potent and potentially more dangerous than pot that is smoked or vaped.
The new study analyzed thousands of cannabis-triggered emergency room visits in the greater Denver area, and found that edibles induced a disproportionate number of pot-related medical crises. Edibles were also more likely than inhaled pot to cause severe intoxication, acute psychiatric symptoms in people with no history of psychiatric illness and cardiovascular problems.
Pot smokers, on the other hand, were more likely to have gastrointestinal complaints, including a vomiting condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, and they were more likely to be hospitalized if they needed emergency care.
Emergency room doctors in Colorado started noticing several years ago that "there were a lot of visits associated with edibles, even though they were not the predominant product used, and they seemed to be sicker compared to those who inhaled," said Dr. Andrew Monte, an associate professor of medicine and the lead author of the new study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.
He also noted that the only deaths in Colorado that have been definitively attributed to cannabis involved edibles, and those deaths were surprisingly violent. In all three incidents, including a murder and a suicide in 2014 and another suicide in 2015, the pot users exhibited extremely erratic behavior after consuming edibles, according to news reports and trial testimony.
Ingested pot takes longer to produce a high than smoked pot, making it harder to gauge the right dose to achieve the desired effect, which increases the risk of an overdose, experts say. Ingested pot also takes longer for the body to clear.
"When you're smoking marijuana, you start seeing the effects in a couple of minutes," said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. "But when you take it orally, it takes a long time to feel the effects, and if you're taking it in order to feel good and you feel nothing, you may think you didn't take enough. This is a common phenomenon. People take another dose."
The edible candies "look very innocent and safe, so you take another and another, and slowly it is being absorbed. And then you start to feel awful, before you complete the absorption, and that can lead to a psychotic episode," Volkow said.
Responses to the effects of edibles and the rate of absorption vary from one person to another, and the THC content in products may not be labeled accurately, she noted. Absorption of edibles will also vary depending on the fat content of the food one has consumed, she said, noting that "the content in your blood is going to be much, much higher when you take it with chocolate or a brownie rather than a gummy bear."

Texto completo: Milton Claney remembers standing in the University of Pittsburgh's stadium in 1968 when a boy ran past holding his bronze medal yelling, "I won! I won! I won!"
At that moment, he realized what Special Olympics was all about.
"I can't say in 35 years I saw one Special Olympics athlete not give 100 percent," Claney said. "I can't think of one. That's why everyone that gets involved really enjoys it."
The national nonprofit Olympic-style sporting event for people with special needs was founded in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. One year later, Claney, 77, founded the Westmoreland County branch. It will celebrate its 50th anniversary in May.
This week, the Special Olympics found itself in the spotlight after U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testified before Congress and suggested the organization would not receive funds in 2020 -- news that upset Claney and others.
Claney said funds from the federal government help to keep the program running, whether its hosting championships worldwide or funding initiatives in schools across the state.
"She needed to research it a little bit more," Claney said. "She needed to find out exactly how that money was used. There's a lot of money spent every year on this program here in Westmoreland County."
During a budget meeting Wednesday, DeVos defended her proposal, saying, "There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don't get a dime of federal grant money. But given our current budget realities, the federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations."
This was the third year DeVos has suggested cutting federal funding for Special Olympics, a figure this time that amounted to $17.6 million. The U.S. Department of Education faces an overall budget cut of 10 percent, with an allotment of $64 billion in the record $4.75 trillion proposed 2020 budget President Trump sent Congress this month.
By Thursday evening, Trump said the federal government would continue to fund Special Olympics, adding that he had long supported the organization, The New York Times reported.
Before Trump's announcement, Nicole Jones, senior director of marketing and communications for the Pennsylvania Special Olympics, said Congressional support successfully staved off previous calls to cut funding to the organization.
"We see this as an opportunity to continue raising awareness among government officials and our communities about the important work that Special Olympics is doing," she told the Tribune-Review.
Claney said that while he upset by the news, he would have been surprised if Special Olympics was defunded.
"Shriver has created something that is so positive that anything negative is going to be squashed immediately," Claney said. "And cutting the funds is about as negative as you can get."
50th anniversary
Claney was working as a physical education teacher at the Westmoreland Intermediate Unit when he realized his passion for working with people with special needs.
Looking for a job right out of college, and holding a physical education degree, Claney decided to accept a position with the government-created organization -- a job he never saw himself in, but held for 35 years.
"I had some hard days, but I never had a bad day," Claney said. "These kids just appreciate these activities their brothers and sisters were doing in the regular schools."
And in 1968, Claney had a chance to take his work to the next level.
After reading a newspaper advertisement by Shriver about a Special Olympics event that was looking for participants, Claney decided to recruit three students who were interested in competing.
Soon after that, Shriver connected Claney with other people in the area who were interested in the organization, and together they hosted a joint Olympic-style event at Pitt's stadium that attracted over 100 participants and volunteers from local high schools and colleges.
"Other counties started picking up on it," Claney said. "Pretty soon, we were having a Western Pennsylvania event every year."
Claney ran the Westmoreland County branch for 20 years, until 1989. But for the 50th anniversary, he is set to speak at the May 4 event at Norwin High School, said Anthony Monstrola, current co-manager of the organization.
"It's incredible," Monstrola said. "We have a team of 12 members, and I think just all of us are incredibly honored and excited."
The event now draws over 200 athletes, Monstrola said. They compete in events like swimming, bowling, basketball, cycling and more.
Winners from the local event move on to a regional competition at Carnegie Mellon University. After that, a statewide competition will be held at Penn State University. Special Olympics hosts events every summer and winter.

Apple News+: Are 300 magazines worth $9.99 a month?

Texto completo: For a journalism junkie, the 300-some magazines that Apple News+ will let you read for 10 bucks is a great deal. Especially when you also throw in the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star.
But finding what you want to read could be a smoother experience, and there’s still a fair bit of confusion about some of the content that will – or won’t – be included.
Apple News+, of course, is the new paid tier of the company’s curated news service that CEO Tim Cook announced this week. By Apple’s measure, subscribing to all these publications individually would set you back more than $8,000 a year.
Face it, none of you reading this is ever going to subscribe to anything near that number, not even a doctor’s office. What you will discover, though, is an eclectic mix of periodicals that Apple promises you can consume cover to cover. And there’s plenty here to justify your subscription.
What you can read
The wide-ranging list of publications includes: The New Yorker, New York Magazine, Time, Newsweek, The Atlantic, People, Fortune, Fast Company, Sports Illustrated, Vogue, National Geographic, Wired, Popular Science, Rolling Stone, Car and Driver, Parents, Essence, Marie Claire, Travel and Leisure, Vanity Fair and Entertainment Weekly, and too many more to mention.
Online-only outlets are also represented, including theSkimm, The Highlight by Vox, Vulture, and Extra Crunch from Tech Crunch.
The new service is based on Texture, a digital newsstand app Apple acquired about a year ago and that has been referred to as a “Netflix of news. ”
What’s more, the $9. 99 monthly sum also lets members of your family (up to six) read their own favorite periodicals through that single subscription. And you can try the first month of News+ for free.
Unbundling: With yet another streaming option, Apple TV+ brings us further into age of the 'unbundle'
Robocall fight: Verizon adds free 'Call Filter' feature in bid to fight robocalls
Not every major publisher is taking part. Among the missing are the New York Times and Washington Post, which both have thriving digital operations behind paywalls. News+ is also light on local news.
And some readers, quite frankly, may be satisfied with all the content you can already read gratis through the free version of Apple News, not to mention elsewhere online. It’s hard-enough finding the time to read everything you want to get to. Others will view this like cable TV: Why pay for publications you have no intention of ever reading?
The free version of Apple News already gives you a lot to consume, including stories from USA TODAY and other publications that don’t charge for digital access. Even among publications that do charge, you can typically read a set number of articles for free.
A separate My Magazines section shows the covers of magazines you have shown you’re interested in. By tapping a magazine cover, you can dive into the issue, which is designed for the phone or tablet experience with the publication’s familiar typography and photography.
In a few cases, those magazine covers come alive, moving just like the Live Photos images on an iPhone.
One article I came across in Vanity Fair, included video of Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph driving in a convertible – I imagine there will be more and more video sprinkled across various publications over time.
For now, the ads are not interactive; it’ll be interesting to see if Apple and its partners go that route.
And yes, magazines can be downloaded to read offline.
Many of today’s readers, especially younger readers, may be less devoted to a given publication and more interested in the topic areas and subjects covered across numerous publications. Articles that News+ grouped under Fashion, for example, came from Elle, Bazaar, and Shape.
“People in the News” articles came from Fortune, People, Time and Billboard.
“What millennials value is convenience and the ability to hit one native application and be able to browse multiple publications in one user experience,” says Joseph Anthony, founder of Hero Traveler, a travel-focused social media platform. “Millennials have grown up as part of this highlight generation. ”
I appreciate stumbling on material I might not otherwise come across just like the next person. But as a traditional magazine reader, I like going to a familiar publication and digesting what is there. For $9. 99, you get an awful lot to digest.
The company bases recommended reading material through a combination of human curators and “on-device intelligence. ”
Some publishers will let you access some past content as a News+ subscriber.
If you read the Wall Street Journal inside News+, for example, all of the articles in the paper will be made available and searchable for three days, a Journal spokesperson said.
The Journal’s channel within Apple News+ features general interest content and top stories and opinions daily that have been curated by a Journal editorial team.
But Apple News+ subscribers will not get other Dow Jones products, such as the Dow Jones Newswires, or content targeted to professional markets (for example, WSJ Pro, CFO Journal, CMO Today). Journal newsletters, market data, video and audio content, are also not included.
Indeed, the key question to ask if you are already paying for a digital publication that is now lumped into the News+ subscription is why keep doing so?
A regular all-access digital subscription to the Journal costs $38. 99 plus tax.
The onus is on the publication to make the case.
I pay $5. 99 a month (or $59. 99 a year) for digital access to The New Yorker. Why continue? The New Yorker’s pitch is that while subscribing under Apple News+ gets you all the articles and cartoons that appear in the weekly print magazine, the New Yorker publishes 10 to 15 articles daily online that you won’t be able to read, notably many breaking investigative pieces. Nor will you be able to access the New Yorker crossword or the publication’s newsletters.
Apple isn’t saying, but the company reportedly asks publishers for a 50 percent cut of subscription revenues, more than the 30 percent it typically takes for App Store purchases.
It’s no secret that magazine and newspaper publishers have had a really tough go of it, which helps explain their willingness to play ball with Apple despite what appear to be onerous terms. Publishers are counting on gaining a lot more subscribers through Apple rather than losing the ones they already have.

Adam Schiff has no business on the Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: Haya Konte, una madre inmigrante de El Bronx (NYC) cuyas dos hijas infantes murieron en el incendio de su apartamento, llegó a un acuerdo de culpabilidad de homicidio por negligencia criminal, optando por irse del país para evitar la cárcel.
No había detectores de humo en funcionamiento en el apartamento y el fuego fue causado por la quema de incienso mientras Konte (29) lavaba la ropa afuera, en abril de 2016, según los bomberos.
Konte, que estaba embarazada en ese momento, dijo que pensaba que un compañero de residencia estaba en casa cuando cruzó la calle para lavar la ropa.
El acuerdo de culpabilidad fue acordado con su ex esposo, el padre de las niñas fallecidas de 2 años y 18 meses de edad, dijeron las autoridades.
Su tercer hijo, una bebé de 2 años, estuvo en el tribunal ayer, cuando el Fiscal Auxiliar de Distrito Morgan Dolan pidió que se impusiera la sentencia aprobada por el padre “de las dos niñas que murieron como resultado de la acción de la señora Konte”, citó New York Post.
Nacida en Francia y criada en Gambia, Konte no se convirtió en ciudadana estadounidense, a pesar de que su entonces esposo sí lo era.
El mes pasado le dijo a The New York Times que no sabía a qué país se iría con su bebé.

Texto completo: ALBANY – New York has some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. Now it has another distinction: the tallest male politician in the world.
Robert Cornegy Jr, a New York City councilman from Brooklyn, made the Guinness World Records on Wednesday after he was measured at 6-foot-10.
Cornegy, 53, was honored Wednesday for the distinction by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who himself stands 6-foot-5.
Cornegy said the goal is to encourage children to strive to be their best, regardless of their physical stature.
"Today I get to send a resounding message to all the young people in the world who may have come in different packages, so they may not have the normal physical stature and would like to still make a difference, you can absolutely do that," he said at a City Hall ceremony.
"And you don't need to be relegated to a particular segment of society based on how you look."
Breaking the record Cornegy took office in 2014 and was a reserve basketball player on the legendary 1984-85 St. John's team that went to the Final Four and included city legends Chris Mullin and Mark Jackson.
He later graduated from Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, Westchester County, and played professional basketball overseas.
Cornegy said it was an arduous process to get the record: He had to get measured by three doctors at the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn after Guinness wanted a tally that wasn't from St. John's.
He said he was measured repeatedly. In fact, one measurement put him at 6-foot-11 and a half, but the measurements averaged to 6-foot-10.
"We had several measurements that had to be taken in several positions over a long period of time," Cornegy said.
Why the record is important Cornegy said being tall is often viewed by people as a good thing, but it comes with challenges.
He said he has to be cognizant of not standing too close to constituents for fear that he is intimidating them.
When he was a teenager, he recalled how he would go clothes shopping with friends, but couldn't find anything his size.
"It's tough when you are just trying to fit in," he said Wednesday.
And with a 17-inch shoe size, he has to get custom shoes and suits, which are expensive.
So he said the recognition aims to let people know that "you can lead no matter how you look or no matter what shape you're in, or not matter what size you come in."
Guinness officials told the New York Times that Cornegy bested Sir Louis Gluckstein, a London politician who died in 1979, by two and a half inches.
De Blasio joked he usually is the tallest person in the room, and even hopped up on the step behind the City Hall podium to stand at eye level with Cornegy.
"This man's head is never in the clouds — despite the fact that his head is quite literally always in the crowd," de Blasio joked.
Then the mayor added, "I can't wait to see what world record Robert Cornegy breaks next. He has limitless potential."
New York City Councilman Robert Cornegy Jr. was named in 2019 as the tallest politician in the world by the Guinness World Records. Here he is with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio who is 6-foot-5. Cornegy is 6-foot-10.

Tight PSO show highlights work of tight trio

Texto completo: The Portland Symphony Orchestra's programs, like those of most orchestras, tend to hop around eras and compositional styles, occasionally with elements that link the works, more typically without them. But the program the orchestra played Tuesday evening at Merrill Auditorium, "The Schumann Circle," brought together works by three 19th century German composers who were exceptionally close.
Two of them, Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck Schumann, were married. The third, Johannes Brahms, idolized Robert (who died in 1856, when Brahms was 23) and was in love, almost certainly platonically, with Clara for most of his life (they both lived into the late 1890s). And just as Brahms looked to Robert for advice in his early works, he continued sending his scores to Clara for decades, and took her comments to heart.
On Tuesday, Ruth Reinhardt, a German conductor who studied at the Juilliard School with Alan Gilbert (the director of the New York Philharmonic at the time) and spent two seasons as the assistant conductor at the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, was on the podium. Reinhardt, who is also a violinist, an oboist and a composer, is an energetic presence whose cues are unequivocal, and who drew a rich, gleaming and generally powerful sound from the orchestra.
The curtain-raiser was Brahms' "Tragic Overture" (Op. 81), a work Brahms completed in 1880 and revised the following year. It is a standalone piece; that is, it is not an overture for a particular stage work, and Brahms had no literary work in mind. He just wanted to write a piece that crystalized, in music, the emotions associated with tragedy.
That wasn't heavy lifting for a German Romantic composer; tragedy was where they were most at home, a point Brahms demonstrated in the two chords that open the piece. Those two chords are so packed with menace and portentousness that you know immediately that something tragic has occurred; the details hardly matter.
Reinhardt got immediately to the heart of the piece by having the orchestra play those chords with a startlingly brutal sharpness and following through with a taut, tense reading. At first, it seemed slightly too taut - you wanted a hint of flexibility in dynamics or tempos, a breath between the tragic gestures that pile on top of each other. Eventually, Reinhardt lightened up slightly - enough to allow that needed elasticity.
Striking, too, was how well the orchestra was playing, not only here, but in Robert Schumann's Symphony No. 3 ("Rhenish"), which closed the program. In both works, the strings played with both drive and warmt
The Schumann, of course, is a considerably more expansive and varied work, and it poses greater interpretive challenges. As in the Brahms, Reinhardt seemed intent on a high-pressure reading, an approach that worked well here, particularly in the opening movement, which is packed with grand gestures for a conductor (and her players) to revel in, and the finale, to which Reinhardt brought intensity and the kind of brisk, sharp articulation that conveys a sense of virtuosic precision.
Between the Brahms and Schumann, Diane Walsh joined the orchestra as the soloist in Clara Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor (Op. 7). It's a surprisingly mature work, given that she completed it at age 14, and it includes some fascinating innovations - most notably, a central movement for piano and cello alone.
It is a lively, sometimes playful work, with a sparkling piano part that offers a glimpse of the technique for which Clara was renowned. Walsh gave it a thoughtful performance, with enough energy to bring its considerable melodic riches and surprising harmonic turns fully to life. And Walsh and cellist William Rounds gave a beautiful account of the duet movement.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was hot and muddy, and there wasn't enough to eat or drink.
That, at least, is the way Jay Schreiber, a former deputy sports editor for The New York Times, remembered the Woodstock music festival in 1969.
While he was there, the Mets, the humorously bad National League team that had curiously started to play better that summer, had a doubleheader scheduled against the San Diego Padres in Flushing, Queens.
"I can be home in two hours," Mr. Schreiber, then 19, remembered thinking. So he left.
He watched the Mets win four games in a row over two days. Improbably, they would go on to win the World Series in a season that he and countless other Mets fans still reminisce about 50 years later.
A 20-page special section in Thursday's paper celebrates the anniversary of the championship that earned the team its nickname: the "Miracle Mets." Mr. Schreiber, who is 68 and semiretired, edited the section and hopes younger fans will appreciate the uncanniness of the season. For those who were there, it is a chance to revisit the magical, mystical year.
"'How did that happen?' is still the prevailing sentiment," Mr. Schreiber said.
The section is built around the narrative arc of the team from its inception in 1962, and chronicles its evolution from bumbling incompetence to unlikely success. It includes excerpts from contemporaneous Times articles, as well as new columns by baseball writers of the era, including Robert Lipsyte, who covered the Mets for The Times, and George Vecsey, who wrote about the Mets for The Times and Newsday. Wayne Kamidoi and Fred Bierman were the art directors for the project.
"We sort of created a Mets yearbook," Mr. Kamidoi said, referring to the magazine-like collections that once were released annually for individual teams.
"That was a big thing before the internet," he said. "Fans would religiously buy the official team yearbook, with stories about the past, stories about this year's team." (Mr. Kamidoi had his own collection of Detroit Tigers yearbooks.)
But the project is really undergirded by Mr. Schreiber's own relationship with the Mets, whom he started rooting for in 1962, when he was 12. (His often frustrated devotion to the team was so well known that when he retired from The Times in 2017, the Sports Department arranged for the team's mascot, Mr. Met, to attend his going-away party.)
In Flushing, where Mr. Schreiber grew up, most people had come from Brooklyn, which meant they were Dodgers fans. When the Dodgers decamped for Los Angeles in 1957, their fans were left without a team. (For many, adopting the Yankees wasn't a viable option.)
As a child, Mr. Schreiber initially embraced the Yankees. They were the best team in baseball at the time, and their roster was riddled with famous players -- Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford. So during the Mets' first season in 1962, Mr. Schreiber split his loyalties.
But by the end of that first year, he chose the Mets -- probably because it aligned him with his father, he said.
The Mets were terrible -- they lost a modern-era-record 120 games in their first season -- but their antics became the stuff of legend. In 1963, Jimmy Piersall ran around the bases backward after hitting the 100th home run of his career. That same season, pitcher Roger Craig tried wearing No. 13 to break an 18-game losing streak. (It worked.)
"It was kind of rebellious to root for the worst team ever," Mr. Schreiber recalled.
By the summer of 1969, the team's luck had turned. That fall, as the Mets battled to win their division, Mr. Schreiber and his friends piled into his car in Buffalo, where he was attending college, so they could get out-of-town broadcasts on the radio -- including one Friday-night doubleheader that the Mets swept with identical 1-0 scores. During the World Series, Mr. Schreiber and his classmates crowded into the student union to watch the games on 20-inch televisions. The Mets won the Series in five games.
For today's sports fans, there are countless ways to relive a team's big win including articles, commentary and replays.
After the Mets won the 1969 World Series, Mr. Schreiber wanted to read everything about the win, but he didn't have access to all the New York City papers in Buffalo. "I really wanted to savor what we had done, but I couldn't," he said.
For him, this project was a chance to return to that era and savor the victory -- and to bask in the joy we experience when our heroes pull off the preposterous.

Texto completo: A World Series Souvenir That You Can Water
This article was originally published in The New York Times on Oct. 17, 1969.
By George Vecsey
They came over the barricades like extras in a pirate movie, all hot-eyed and eager to plunder. Their hands were empty and their hearts were full and they were champions of the world -- fan division.
For half an hour they sacked Shea Stadium yesterday afternoon and when they were done, great gaps of dirt appeared in the grass and there were craters where the fans had clawed at home plate and the pitching mounds.
The ground crew stared at the wreckage and promised that the field would be ready -- somehow -- for the first home game for the Jets, next Monday night.
It will take four days of hard work to repair the damage of half an hour, but nobody can say it was not fun. The fans did have one eye on the television cameras, and they had obviously rehearsed in two previous clinching victories in Shea. But when the Mets rallied in those last glorious innings, the younger fans got the spirit all over again.
It is a cliché about the World Series that the true fans do not have the pull or the money to obtain tickets to a game. Yet the wild-eyed fans who poured on the field yesterday certainly seemed like the same inspired madmen who discovered the Mets at the Polo Grounds in 1962 and transferred out to Shea in 1964.
In the front rows, the Somewhat Important People cowered in their seats as the younger fans jostled past them. One elderly man deliberately tripped a youngster who was climbing through his section.
Once on the field, the young fans dived into the turf, clawing it out with fingernails, prying it out with pens. Some threw the clods of dirt in the air to fall on other heads and shoulders. But others neatly tucked a clod under their arms and marched away.
"This is a historic moment," said Jack Ginsberg of Middle Village, Queens. "I'm a fan since 1930 and I'm going to save this. You never know what might happen next year. They might turn into schlumps again."
Not all the Champagne was in the Met clubhouse. Scott Barry, 16½ years old, drained the last bubbles from his six ounces of Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin (Reims) and waved the bottle in the air.
"Ever since I was a little kid," he shouted, "back at the Polo Grounds, I've waited for this moment. Now I don't know what to say."
Most of the young fans pranced up and down, holding their forefingers in the air, chanting "One-One-One," like some mystical incantation.
Children of the communications age, they also sought out photographers and interviewers.
"Tell your paper we're No. 1," a young fan shouted.
"Aw, he already knows that," his friend said.
Out in center field, a banner on the flagpole said: "Cortland State loves Nancy Seaver (and Slider)," referring to Tom Seaver's wife and dog.
A young man climbed the eight-foot green outfield fence and his friends handed him a silver dish containing a mottled rubber ball.
"What ball is named Jeffrey T. Spaulding?" said Sue Van Antwerpen, from Westport, Conn.
"Jeffrey used to be better-looking, but he got bitten by a surly black hound dog named Sam who resides at 8 Bermuda Road," said Richard Harrison.
The young man on the fence raised the silver dish in the air. The sun glimmered on Jeffrey T. Spaulding. The worshipers bowed reverently. One could almost smell the incense.
After 15 minutes of unrestrained joy, the crowd was finally herded out through the center-field gate, where special policemen reclaimed most of the swivel chairs taken from the temporary box seats. The graffiti became noticeable on the outfield walls. ("Roz loves Shamsky"). The grass was obviously a war zone. And the ground crew began to survey the damage.
"What can you do?" said John McCarthy, the head groundskeeper, with a sigh. "I wish they could have kept them off, but all I can say is that we've got the men and we'll get the job done by Monday."
Meanwhile, the stadium's hard-working nurse, Mrs. Ruth Harden, tallied up 24 blue injury-report sheets. "Not many fractures," she said. "Actually, most of the injuries were to our employees today."
A police lieutenant, William Hahl, said the only arrests made were "three warrants for wanted persons." He said the fans on the field were not arrested, because the police didn't try to prevent them from doing so. "After a while they got tired of tearing everything up, so they just went home," he said.
And by 6 o'clock, McCarthy's ground crew was beginning to take down the outfield walls that the fans, in their haste, had somehow left behind.

Final score: Jets 16, Colts 7, with Namath, at quarterback, making all the right calls. Was Namath, whose team also played at Shea Stadium, setting an example for the Mets to follow? Who knows, but it is worth noting that on the day of the Mets' ticker-tape parade, Namath and the Jets played a regularseason game at Shea hours later. On the same turf that celebrating fans had torn up three times on the Mets' march to the championship, Namath and the Jets beat the Houston Oilers, 26-17.

Texto completo: With the Vietnam War dragging on, 1969 was not a good year for discussing the character-building value of the military.
From a distance of half a century, however, it seems rather clear -- at least to me -- that the loopy young Mets franchise had its spine stiffened by two men trained by the United States Marines.
Two of the steeliest people in the Mets clubhouse were Gil Hodges, the manager, and Tom Seaver, the pitcher, later known as The Franchise. Both could turn downright taut -- eyes narrowing, jaws tightening, speech clipped -- when reporters or broadcasters or fans or even Mets ballplayers acted as if these were the Same Old Mets.
We reporters were the worst. I know I was conditioned to believe that the Mets were fun, but terminally hapless.
Wipe that smile off your face, Mister. This is no laughing matter.
Hodges had seen combat on Okinawa, while Seaver was a Marine reservist. Semper Fi. They staked out territory and they did not give it up.
Hodges had been part of the Mets in the first goofy days, in spring training 1962, when Casey Stengel was filibustering to catch the public's attention. Hodges was happy to be back from Los Angeles, in his wife's home borough of Brooklyn, where he was beloved for his grand decade-plus with the Dodgers. His knee was shot, and Marvin Eugene Throneberry (check out the initials) became the regular first baseman and an immortal Met blunderer.
The Mets were not adequate enough to benefit from Hodges's Boys of Summer way of doing things. He became the manager of the Washington Senators for what some felt was an apprenticeship for the Mets' job, which he was offered in 1968.
Seaver arrived from the farm system in 1967, after growing up fast in the Marines and later learning the game under Rod Dedeaux at the University of Southern California. In some ways, Seaver was a normal young man in his early 20s -- full of energy, a whooping laugh, pranks on teammates. He could also do The New York Times crossword puzzle and converse with writers. When he was playing, he did not bring up his time in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1962-63, but later he talked proudly about it.
"I was a mediocre student," Seaver recalled on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2011, at a ceremony in Manhattan honoring military veterans. "If it didn't have a ball involved, I wasn't much interested." But the Marines sharpened his focus.
"The principles that I learned in boot camp were the principles that I took to the mound," he said. "Focus, dedication. I wouldn't have made it without the Marine Corps."
Seaver mentioned a picture taken of him on the mound, locked into attention, during the playing of the national anthem. "You look at my feet, they're in military position, absolutely," he said. "That's the discipline that was instilled in me. It's a very important reason why I'm in Cooperstown."
It is not clear how much Seaver and Hodges discussed their Marine roots with each other. They had served under vastly different circumstances -- Seaver stateside, Hodges facing incoming kamikaze pilots in the Pacific Theater.
Hodges was a college boy from southern Indiana, noticeable because of his muscles. Stengel, on one of his franchise-building conversational rambles, once said that Hodges was so strong "he could squeeze your earbrows off." Nobody knew what an earbrow was, and nobody wanted to ask.
I had a mentor in the newspaper business who had been a young Columbia University dropout and baseball freak, sent to the island of Okinawa. There were rumors that a large young Marine on the island was a major league ballplayer. (The Dodgers had let Hodges play one game at third base in 1943 before he shipped out.)
On Okinawa, my friend heard rumors that Hodges had been in hand-to-hand combat, but that rumor has been deflated by Mort Zachter, the author of "Gil Hodges: A Hall of Fame Life," published in 2015. Hodges was awarded a Bronze Star, with the citation mentioning his duties supporting his commanding officer, in a dangerous zone, but there is no mention of his being in direct combat. He surely saw death all around him.
When Hodges became a star with the Dodgers, he often went to the movies in his free time. A friend who accompanied him said Hodges would grow solemn if there was a scene of combat, and he would pray, "Amen," at every fallen military person.
Hodges carried his Marine steel in the manager's uniform. When reporters made jokes he smiled weakly and politely, but he did not encourage levity or cynicism.
Few players challenged Hodges, except for the earnest and curious young outfielder Ron Swoboda, otherwise known as Rocky, who had grown used to the garrulous orations of Stengel.
"I would sit and listen to him," Swoboda said of the Old Man in 2009. "It would sound as if he was speaking in Stengelese, but all of a sudden I'd say, 'Hey, man, this guy is telling a parable -- and it's aimed at me!"'
By 1969, Casey was three full seasons into retirement and Gil Hodges was the manager. "When you're young and full of yourself, you do things you regret," Swoboda said. "Gil sometimes made me feel he was rubbing our noses in his authority, but that was me, that was my fault.
"I remember one time early in 1969 he held a meeting and he said, 'You guys are professionals, you set your own curfew,' and somebody suggested two and a half hours after the game, and Gil said it was too long, and I popped up, 'Gil, why don't you just tell us?' I would do my thing like that. Why didn't I just shut up?"
One player who was definitely in tune with Hodges was the third-year pitcher Tom Seaver. On May 21, 1969, Seaver beat the Braves in Atlanta to bring the Mets to an 18-18 record -- the latest in their first eight seasons that they had been even.
"Tom, Tom," babbled one of the regular reporters (not me, but it easily could have been). "You're a .500 ball club. Aren't you going to celebrate?"
Seaver, who could be garrulous when he wanted to be, gave us the Hodges stare.
"What's so good about .500?" Seaver snapped. "That's only mediocre. We didn't come into the season to play .500 ball. I'm tired of the jokes about the old Mets."
And he wasn't done. Seaver then invoked two fan-and-writer favorites from the first few years of the Mets.
"Let Rod Kanehl and Marvelous Marv laugh about the Mets. We're out here to win. You know when we'll have Champagne? When we win the pennant."
Seaver and Hodges seemed to have similar drill instructors in the Marines. Hodges was changing the work habits of the team, backed up by having talented young players at his command. Nobody was exempt from protocol. One day he trudged slowly out to left field and inquired about the health of Cleon Jones, his best hitter, who had pursued a ball a little too slowly for Hodges's taste. The manager then escorted Jones to the dugout, and fans and writers wondered if he might have lost Jones. Instead, Jones played well down the stretch.
Those of us who were around in 1962 -- The Year of Marvelous Marv -- never thought the Mets, even with those young arms, could ever win anything. But they did win the pennant, and they did spray Champagne.
Just before the World Series, Seaver was asked about the national antiwar protest planned for Oct. 15. He was quoted as asking, "What is so unpatriotic about being against such a terrible war?" He touched off some debates, and stopped commenting on the war, but he had made his point.
The Mets won the World Series in five games, and they sprayed everybody all over again -- Seaver being one of the chief celebrants.
In that stunning autumn, we did not think of Seaver and Hodges as ex-Marines, but now it seems that some of their discipline was part of those Amazing Mets.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Marsha P. Johnson was not well known during her life. But in death, her legacy is stamped indelibly onto the rainbow pride flag.
The transgender activist was among a group of blacks who in the 1960s stood on the front lines of the LGBT liberation movement and is now receiving overdue credit for her trailblazing role.
Johnson, who founded one of the first organizations to protect transgender youth, was an outspoken figure in New York’s Greenwich Village.
“For so long, the role that people like Marsha played was dismissed,” says Marisa Richmond, a trans scholar who teaches history at Middle Tennessee State University. “The world is more open, welcoming and inclusive than it was 50 years ago. Her efforts helped make that happen. ”
Johnson was part of the “vanguard” that resisted police during the Stonewall riots — demonstrations that followed a raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in the Village, on June 28, 1969, according to the 2010 book "Stonewall", written by LGBT historian David Carter.

At the time, New York refused to grant licenses to bars that served gays, which allowed police to enter Stonewall with a warrant. They arrested 13 people.
“The majority of people at Stonewall were either drag queens or gay men of color,” Titus Montalvo, a hairdresser and makeup artist who was 16 at the time, told USA TODAY.
The incident became a rallying cry for the nascent gay rights movement.
Many in the LGBT community credit Johnson for throwing the first brick or shot glass that sparked the riots. Johnson said she didn’t arrive at the bar until rioting was underway. Nevertheless, her role is hailed.
“There are lots of different accounts of what she did during the riots,” says Michael Boucai, associate professor of law at the University at Buffalo School of Law who studies LGBTQ rights and history. “The consensus is that she did climb a lamppost and throw a very heavy object that was in a bag and shattered a police (car) window. ”
The following year, Johnson and a close friend, Sylvia Rivera, founded the trans-youth organization STAR — Street Transvestite (now Transgender) Action Revolutionaries — that housed and fed homeless youths.
Donald Bell of Chicago, a former dean of students at several colleges, says Stonewall called attention to a group of people who lacked basic civil rights. “That’s why Marsha’s visibility and advocacy remain important,” he says. “She and a number of others who lived at the intersection between racism and homophobia were political agitators that helped advance the mindset of society. ”
Marsha P. Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels in Elizabeth, N. J. , in 1945. She said the “P” in her name stood for “Pay-it-no-mind. ”
Often draped in shimmering robes, red plastic high heels and floral headdresses, she was a muse of pop artist Andy Warhol and has been the subject of several films, including a 2017 Netflix documentary, "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson. "
“When he got off the bus, everyone would notice,” says Al Michaels, Johnson’s nephew, who grew up calling Johnson “Uncle Mikey. ”
“We’d be playing football in the streets as kids,” Michaels recalls. “Soon as he turned the corner, he’d have on fruit, a big hat with flowers. ”
After Stonewall, Johnson joined the gay liberation front. In the 1980s, she became an outspoken activist with the AIDS charity ACT UP.
She died in 1992 at age 46. Her body was found in the Hudson River six days after she was reported missing. Police ruled Johnson’s death a suicide, which members of the local gay community disputed. In 2012, authorities reopened the investigation into her death, which remains unsolved, according to her nephew.
Johnson’s death attracted scant media attention at the time, but her life and contributions have been celebrated in recent years. In 2018, The New York Times published a full obituary on her significance in the LGBT liberation movement.
“The 50th anniversary of Stonewall is coming up this June. I’m hoping that this time, trans people and people of color are front and center in the local pride celebrations,” Richmond says. “After all, we were there from the very beginning. ”

Data breaches escalate

Texto completo: The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies. New Jersey is not immune.
More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said. "To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said.
"Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

Texto completo: VtDigger
HENNIKER, N.H. — Many people know Marianne Williamson as a spiritual leader and lecturer whose book A Return to Love became a New York Times bestseller with the help of Oprah Winfrey.
Fewer know Williamson as a 2016 Bernie Sanders’ presidential supporter turned 2020 Democratic primary competitor.
“The basic struggle is between democracy and aristocracy,” the 66-year-old California author and activist says in a stump speech that calls for a higher minimum wage and more government help with health care and college costs.
Williamson’s progressive positions mirror those of the Vermont U.S. senator, who she endorsed in his first White House bid. Her commitment to Sanders’ campaign generated headlines like “Hollywood’s Favorite New Age Guru Backs Bernie Sanders for President.”
Now she is turning heads by entering the 2020 race on her own.
“I still love Bernie,” she says, “but I feel moved to run.”
Specifically, Williamson wants to morph Sanders’ call for “revolution” into her own campaign motto, “Join the Evolution.”
“Whether you are healing a life, or healing a nation, the same spiritual and moral and psychological principles prevail,” she recently told an audience in Henniker. “I don’t want to go to Washington to fight for you, I want to go to Washington and create with you.”
The journey is proving challenging. Sanders won the 2016 New Hampshire Democratic Primary by 22 percentage points over eventual party nominee Hillary Clinton and tops the latest 2020 Granite State Poll. Williamson, in comparison, doesn’t even register on the survey, which misspells her first name.
Likewise, while Sanders touts raising nearly $6 million in his campaign’s first 24 hours, Williamson is trying to sign up 65,000 individual donors so she can qualify to appear in Democratic debates. Almost halfway there, she’s focusing her efforts in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire and fellow early-bird voting enclaves of Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.
Vermonter Susan Welsh, a retired community college instructor, knows Williamson for her spiritual teachings. When she learned the candidate would be speaking at Henniker’s New England College — where the Norwich resident attended as a freshman in 1968 — she decided to travel across the border.
“She has an uphill climb, but I am listening to everyone,” Welsh said. “I resent that this woman is being counted out before she’s even heard.”
Williamson is grateful.
“You’re listening to all 1,736 candidates,” she told the New England College audience of a field that actually numbers about two dozen confirmed or considering entrants.
She is promoting her platform — which also calls for federal departments of peace and youth — on her website, in press such as the recent Washington Post Magazine cover story “Marianne Williamson Wants to Be Your Healer in Chief” and her coming book A Politics of Love.
“You can’t just tinker with the machine,” Williamson told her New Hampshire audience. “We have to heal this country. We have to harness love for political purposes.”

DSM Book Festival brings authors to town

Texto completo: Picture your book club. Keep the glasses of Chardonnay and hold the laughs at witty takes level, but increase your attendance 20 fold.
That's what the DSM Book Festival hopes to be.
Hitting Capital Square in downtown Des Moines on Saturday, the DSM Book Festival has scored three heavy-hitting headliners — Susan Orlean, Garth Stein and Nnedi Okorafor — and plans a host of literary-themed discussions and classes.
Now, the Des Moines Storytellers Project is proud to announce that we are joining the book-themed fun with an event featuring beloved tales from our archives.
"From the collection: Treasured stories from the Des Moines Storytellers Project" will bow at 6 p.m. on the Prairie Meadows Authors Pavilion and will feature storytellers revisiting pieces that made our first four seasons sparkle.
At the Storytellers Project, journalists with the Des Moines Register coach everyday Iowans to tell true, first-person stories live onstage without notes.
Like a chat around the campfire or a visit among friends, the Storytellers Project celebrates that good stories don't necessarily have to be bound up in a book — an idea that's also central to the mission of this new festival, said Colleen Murphy, downtown events director with the Greater Des Moines Partnership.
"We will have the authors, but a lot of the festival is centered around discussion and celebrating how people love to share stories or what they've read with each other," she said.
Born from the success of smaller book-focused events, The DSM Book Festival is aimed at connecting readers with people who produce work you can read.
Like all good book clubs, the festival is 50 percent literature discussion and 50 percent party.
"When I read a book, one of the more exciting things I love after I finish is to talk with someone about it," Murphy said. "So this festival is bringing that to life in a community celebration."
For more than a year, a committee of citizens, literary folk and business leaders have been planning the event. Throughout the process, they've made a concerted effort to secure authors whose work has transcended the literary scene, Murphy said.
A staff writer at the New Yorker, Susan Orlean has had multiple books land on the best-seller list, including "The Orchid Thief," which was later made into "Adaptation," a film starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Orlean is appearing at the festival as part of the Des Moines Public Library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) event series.
Garth Stein is the author of the perennial book club favorite, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which will be made into a film this year.
And Nnedi Okorafor wrote some of the Black Panther comics that inspired the 2018 Oscar-nominated eponymous film. An award-winning science fiction author when not writing for panels, Okorafor is known for her Africa-based fantasy and myth-infused magical realism young adult books.
Her Akata series, which centers on a young Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can cast spells, was called a "Nigerian Harry Potter" by the New York Times.
In addition to the author talks, there will be a children's stage for young readers and a host of "make and take classes" featuring book discussions paired with a craft.
On the cooking stage, classes will include the Grape Gatsby, a wine tasting with a 1920s theme, and For Whom the Beer Tolls, a lecture on authors and the drinks they loved.
The Des Moines Storytellers Project is currently in its fourth season and has shows scheduled throughout this year. To become a teller or attend a show, visit DesMoinesRegister.com/Storytellers.
The Des Moines Register is a sponsor of the DSM Book Festival.

Daily on Healthcare: Soda taxes get a big boost from pediatricians

PEDIATRICIANS, HEART HEALTH ADVOCATES COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF SODA TAXES: For the first time, the nation’s leading pediatrics and heart health advocates have endorsed soda taxes.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association released a policy statement on Monday pushing for local, state, and federal governments to place limits on sugary beverages through advertising restrictions, warning labels, and limitations on what children can have to drink in restaurants. Many of the suggestions mirror laws passed to successfully reduce tobacco use, and the organizations said they are meant to reduce obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

"This is kind of the low hanging fruit," said Dr. Sheela Magge , co-author of the policy document. "There is no nutritional value in drinking soda ... We have already said we don't recommend them, but this is actually recommending public policy in terms of trying to reduce children's consumption of sugary drinks."

The organizations support water and milk as the default drinks for children and teens. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children consume 17 percent of their calories from added sugars, nearly half of which are from sugary drinks. Government dietary guidelines recommend people consume no more than 10 percent of their calories from added sugars.

A growing number of cities have passed soda taxes, though the beverage industry has been effective at pushing back.

“America’s beverage companies believe there’s a better way to help reduce the amount of sugar consumers get from beverages and it includes putting parents in the driver’s seat to decide what’s best for their children," said William Dermody , spokesman for the American Beverage Association.

The industry has made several changes to its products, including voluntarily reducing calories and sugar, displaying nutritional information more prominently, and reducing the size of their drinks. It has encouraged restaurants, including fast food chains, to make water, milk, and 100 percent juice the default choices for children's meals.

"It’s not enough," said Magge. "We are still having really high rates of obesity in the country. We are having increases in Type 2 diabetes ... They disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our communities. It’s good that they are coming up with smaller quantities and trying to make some effort, but that shouldn't prevent us from trying to do the best we can to advocate for our kids."

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PREPARE TO UNVEIL LEGISLATION TO SHORE UP OBAMACARE: Democratic leaders on Tuesday will introduce a bill aimed at funneling more funds into Obamacare and restoring parts of the law that were undone by the Trump administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md., Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone , D-N.J., Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal , D-Mass., Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott , D-Va., and freshmen House Democrats will hold a press event about the bill at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday.

The bill is expected to allow more Obamacare customers to get subsidies, to include more money for advertising the law and for navigators who help people sign up, and to restore a reinsurance fund, among other proposals that have received a hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.

TO REACH HIV GOAL, TRUMP WILL NEED TO GAIN THE SUPPORT OF GROUPS THAT DON’T LIKE HIM: To achieve his goal of ending HIV transmission, President Trump will have to emulate the success that Washington, D.C. has had. That, in turn, will mean gaining the trust of groups that are skeptical of the Trump administration because of its record on LGBT issues and proposals to cut Medicaid.

Washington has extensive on-the-ground programs that have driven down the rate of HIV-positive residents by more than 50 percent over the past decade. Part of the city’s success is attributable to health and advocacy groups like HIPS that work very closely and build trust with people who are engaged in sex work and drug use, are homeless, or are transgender.

The Trump administration will have to expand some of the lessons from D.C. to other city neighborhoods to have success, despite the cultural and political differences.

“We need to earn people’s trust, I understand that,” assistant secretary for health Dr. Brett Giroir told Kimberly. “We are prepared to do that.”

Read more of Kimberly’s piece here.

NEW JERSEY TO BUILD ITS OWN OBAMACARE EXCHANGE: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey announced a proposal Friday to have the state build its own health insurance exchange by 2021. The state is currently using the federally run healthcare.gov site, and the plan would need support from the legislature to move forward. If it does, New Jersey would join 11 other states and the District of Columbia that run their own exchanges.

PUERTO RICO LAWMAKERS SEEK VETO OVERRIDE FOR ANTI-ABORTION BILL: Anti-abortion lawmakers in Puerto Rico are seeking the votes to undo a veto by Gov. Ricardo Rossello of a bill that would obligate medical providers to care for babies who are born alive after a failed abortion, similar to a measure that Democrats recently blocked in the U.S. Senate. The bill, the Law for the Protection of Women and the Preservation of Life, would also require minors to get parental consent for abortions and would place requirements on clinics.

AS MANY AS 33 MILLION HAVE HAD THE FLU THIS SEASON: From October 2018 to March 2019, between 28.5 million to 32.8 million people in the U.S. reported flu illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 375,000 and 454,000 people were hospitalized to treat their illness — already more than the total for the season in some recent past years.

ACLU SUES TO BLOCK TITLE X RULES: The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, on Friday filed a motion requesting a judge to block the Trump administration’s Title X rules from taking effect. Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra also filed requesting an injunction, hoping to put on hold the rules that will prohibit doctors from referring for abortions and that will block facilities from housing abortion and other family planning services in the same building. The motions were on top of lawsuits filed earlier this month challenging the legality of the rules.

NEW GROUP: COALITION FOR FAIR DRUG PRICES: Families USA and 11 other organizations launched the Coalition for Fair Drug Prices last week to urge policymakers to lower prescription drug prices. The coalition released a list of principles that includes lowering list prices, demanding accountability for public funds spent on research and development, and requiring full transparency from pharmaceutical companies and the whole supply chain.

SECOND PARKLAND SURVIVOR DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE: A survivor of last year's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School died by suicide on Saturday, about a week after another survivor is believed to have done the same. Although a name has not been released, police are calling the death an “apparent suicide.” It was reported Friday that Sydney Aiello , 19, also killed herself the prior weekend.

Texto completo: These two silver screen lovebirds will always remember.
On Monday, Mandy Moore got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the occasion gifted us with a perfect throwback moment with her "A Walk to Remember" co-star Shane West.
West (who now stars on Fox's "Gotham") surprised Moore with a photo of the pair taken when they wrapped the 2002 romance "A Walk to Remember. "
"We couldn't have been more opposite when we met," West said at the event, noting he was an eyeliner-wearing garage punk musician at the time while she was "killing it" as an early aughts pop star. "I was trying to get you to listen to The Clash and the Ramones. You were not interested, but you were very sweet about it. And you stuck to your Fleetwood Mac. "

But their "Walk" director Adam Shankman thought they'd be a good fit, he recalled. "What can I say but I'm glad he did," said West, calling Moore's energy "irresistible. "
Later, Moore posted a throwback photo on Instagram of her and West. "Stars have always sort of been our thing. Thankful to @theshanewest for his kind words on this very special day, one which I will never forget. It was a walk (of fame) to remember," wrote Moore on Instagram, sharing then-and-now photos of the famous friends.

Also showing support for Moore at her star ceremony was her new husband, Taylor Goldsmith, Shankman, "This Is Us" show creator Dan Fogelman and Moore's "fake family," as Moore called them — including her NBC co-stars Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown, Susan Kelechi Watson, Justin Hartley and Chrissy Metz.
In her speech Monday, Moore also took a moment to speak obliquely about her participation in a New York Times expose about her ex-husband, Ryan Adams. "At this chapter in my life things are starting to feel like they're coalescing," she said Monday. "Recently, I have found myself stepping into my power in a new way. I'm finally starting to understand and own who I am. And I feel really lucky. "
And now, let us revisit Moore's iconic video for "Cry," which also stars West.
Happy Monday!

WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH MARCELITE JORDAN HARRIS: Spelman grad, Air Force trailblazer: Harris became mentor to women pursuing military careers.

Texto completo: Marcelite Jordan Harris' unlikely journey to becoming a history-maker began at Atlanta's Spelman College more than a half-century ago.
Harris was the first African-American woman to achieve the rank of major general in the U.S. Air Force, the first woman aircraft maintenance officer, one of the first two women air officers commanding at the U.S. Air Force Academy and the first woman deputy commander for maintenance.
Not the anticipated career path for a woman who majored in speech and drama.
"She didn't have a clue what her career would become, but she worked really hard and became a trailblazer," said Vera Whisenton, who graduated with Harris from Spelman in 1964.
Harris became a mentor to many women pursuing military careers. She was honored with countless medals and awards. Harris, 75, who died in September, was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.
"Being a leader, being a mentor is not about how much you can fill your own cup, it's about how much you pour into others and with Major General Harris, our cups run over," Lt. Gen. Stayce Harris, no relation, inspector general of the Air Force, said of Harris on the military branch's website. "She poured so much of herself, personally and professional, into all of us and influenced so many -- those she knew and those who knew her from afar."
During the course of her career, Harris was appointed as a White House aide during the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and she was the second female in history to serve as a commanding officer for an Air Force cadet squadron in 1978. In 1988, she became the first female wing commander. In later years, she also served as treasurer of the NAACP's Atlanta branch.
Harris, a Houston native who wanted to be an actress, became a star in a different world.
Acting was not an option, her parents said, when she graduated from Spelman. They said she needed to get a job. She temporarily worked at the USO and was intrigued by the Air Force. She joined, thinking she could travel. Harris enjoyed the work and believed she was making a difference, recalled her daughter, Tenecia Harris.
Harris applied for maintenance officer school, fascinated by the work. She wondered why there weren't any women in aerospace mechanics.
The Air Force rejected her application three times before she was accepted to the school. Harris became the first woman to earn the title of aircraft maintenance officer, but her daughter said her mother's first job was as an administrative assistant and secretary. Harris persisted and eventually achieved her goal of working on aircraft.
"She wasn't going to let them define what she was capable of doing," her daughter said.
As Harris told The New York Times in 2002: "If people just keep pushing against closed doors, they'll eventually get them open."
Through the Air Force, Harris saw America and the world. She retired in 1997, but continued to work in the public sector. In the early 2000s, Harris briefly worked as chief of staff to New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, assisting in efforts to restructure the nation's largest public school system. In 2010, President Barack Obama appointed her to the board of visitors of the Air Force Academy, which investigates the moral, disciplinary and academic affairs of the institution.
Since her death, Tenecia Harris said she's learned much about her mother's impact. At home, Harris, a wife and mother of three, was mom.
"She brought (work) home, but I rarely recall her working from home," her daughter said.
Tenecia Harris said she's encountered several women who said her mother inspired them to strive and succeed in the military.
"Mom just wanted to be herself -- an emotional, dramatic, caring, kind, curious, determined shining light. It was in being herself that she was happy with her job, she succeeded at her job and went on to achieve her own history," her daughter said. "If she could inspire even one person to just be themselves every day, in every way, and to see that is success, that's what her legacy would be."

ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 19 about the exhibition "Broken Nature: Design Takes on Human Survival" in Milan misstates the end year of the data represented in "Room of Change." It is 2400, not 2040.
A picture caption with an article on Page 17 about band reunion tours, using information from the source, misstates the year the picture was taken and one of the band members on stage. The photo was of the band Kiss in 1982, not 1984, and the picture included Ace Frehley, not Tommy Thayer.
TRAVEL
An article last Sunday about Lawrence Ferlinghetti's San Francisco misstated the middle initial of a poet. He is D.A. Powell, not D.

THE HEALTH CARE PARTY LINE THERE ARE MANY ROUTES TO ARRIVE AT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

Texto completo: We're now in the silly season of the Democratic primary - a season that, I worry, may last all the way to the nomination. There are many honorable exceptions, but an awful lot of reporting seems to be third order - not about the candidates, let alone their policy proposals, but about pundits' views about voters' views of candidates' electability. It's a discussion in which essentially nobody has any idea what he or she is talking about.
Meanwhile, however, there are some real continuing policy debates. They're not mainly about goals: Whoever the Democrats nominate will profess allegiance to a progressive agenda aimed at reducing inequality, strengthening the social safety net and taking action on climate change. But there are some big differences about how to achieve those goals.
And the starkest divide involves health care. Almost surely, the eventual platform will advocate "Medicare for TK." But what word is eventually chosen to replace the placeholder "TK," and more important, what that means in terms of actual policy, will be crucial both for the general election and for what comes after if Democrats win.
On one side, there's "Medicare for All," which has come to mean the Bernie Sanders position: replacing the entire existing U.S. health insurance system with a Medicare-type program in which the government pays most medical bills directly.
On the other side, there's "Medicare for America," originally proposed by the Center for American Progress, now embodied in legislation. While none of the announced Democratic candidates has endorsed this proposal yet, it's a good guess that most of them will come around to something similar.
The big difference from a Sanders-type plan is that people would be allowed to keep private coverage if they chose - but they or their employers would also have the option of buying into an enhanced version of Medicare, with substantial subsidies for lower- and middle-income families.
The most important thing you need to know about these rival plans is that both of them would do the job.
Many people realize, I think, that we're the only advanced country that doesn't guarantee essential health care to its legal residents. My guess is that fewer realize that nations achieve that goal in a variety of ways - and they all work.
Every two years, the Commonwealth Fund provides an invaluable survey of major nations' health care systems. America always comes in last; in the latest edition, the three leaders are Britain, Australia and the Netherlands.
What's remarkable about those top three is that they have radically different systems. Britain has true socialized medicine - direct government provision of health care. Australia has single-payer - it's basically Bernie down under. But the Dutch rely on private insurance companies - heavily regulated, with lots of subsidies, but looking more like a better-funded version of Obamacare than like Medicare for All. And the Netherlands actually tops the Commonwealth Fund rankings.
So which system should Democrats advocate? The answer, I'd argue, is the system we're most likely actually to create - the one that will play best in the general election and therefore is the one most likely to be approved by Congress if the Democrat wins.
And there's one big fact on the ground that any realistic health strategy has to deal with: 156 million Americans - almost half the population - currently receive health insurance through their employers. And most of these people are fairly satisfied with their coverage.
A Medicare for All plan would, in effect, say to these people, "We're going to take away your current plan, but trust us, the replacement will be better. And we're going to impose a bunch of new taxes to pay for all this, but trust us, it will be less than you and your employer currently pay in premiums."
The thing is, both of these claims might well be true! A simple, single-payer system would probably have lower overall costs than a hybrid system that preserves some forms of private coverage.
But even if optimistic claims about Medicare for All are true, will people believe them? And even if most people do, if a significant minority of voters don't trust the promises of single-payer advocates, that could easily either doom Democrats in the general election or at least make it impossible to get their plan through Congress.
To me, then, Medicare for America - which lets people keep employment-based insurance - looks like a much better bet for actually getting universal coverage than Medicare for All. But I could be wrong! And it's fine to spend the next few months arguing the issue.
What won't be fine will be is if activists make a no-private-insurance position a litmus test, declaring that anyone advocating a more incrementalist approach is no true progressive, or maybe a corrupt shill for the medical/industrial complex. As you might guess, my concerns aren't drawn out of thin air; they're things I'm already hearing.
So Democrats should try to make this a real debate, one about the best strategy for achieving a shared goal. Can they manage that? I guess we'll find out.

Texto completo: Figaro will be back in Opera Orlando's 2019-20 season, which also features a moving meditation on peace just in time for Christmas.
The opera company announced its lineup Friday at the premiere of its "Pagliacci/Pulcinella." As in the current season, the schedule calls for a mainstage series at the Dr. Phillips Center's Pugh Theater, a roving "Opera on the Town" production and a youth show.
The company also plans another site-specific performance after the success of its "Baber of Seville" at historic Casa Feliz. That undertaking, Strauss' "Die Fledermaus," will happen in April of 2020, but executive director Gabriel Preisser said the location is still being negotiated.
Here's a chronological look at Opera Orlando's 2019-20 season.
Mainstage series
The Marriage of Figaro: Nov. 1-5. In the sequel to "Barber of Seville," Preisser will once again play the wily Figaro. The classic Mozart comedy follows an upstairs-downstairs class struggle on a chaotic wedding day. Orlando Philharmonic musicians will accompany the singers, which include Tess Altiveros, Brittany Renee Robinson and Torlef Borsting. Robert Neu, who directed the Casa Feliz "Seville," will return. Nicola Giusti will conduct the production, sung in Italian with English supertitles.
All Is Calm: Dec. 20-22. Peter Rothstein wrote this beautiful, theatrical piece that uses classical singing and the real words of World War I soldiers to tell a true tale. On Christmas Eve 1914, the trenches of Europe fell silent as German and Allied soldiers put down their guns in a seasonal truce. Vocal arrangers Erick Lichte and Timothy C. Takach have created a score of a cappella singing that includes gorgeous renditions of seasonal favorites "O Holy Night" and "Silent Night." Opera Orlando's production will mark the Central Florida premiere of the work, which was a New York Times Critic's Pick during its off-Broadway run. It is sung in English.
The Daughter of the Regiment: March 26-31, 2020. Donizetti's comedy tells of an orphaned girl who is raised by soldiers. All is well until she's due to be married - and must choose between love and social status.

The show features Orlando Philharmonic musicians and is sung in French with English dialogue.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Subway officials in New York City held a news conference recently to celebrate the system's progress. The on-time rate for trains hit 76 percent, they boasted, signaling a "renaissance" for the floundering system.
But that figure masks a surprising disparity.
While the numbered lines have seen a notable boost in reliability, many of the lettered lines are still delivering poor service. The F train has a miserable on-time rate of about 50 percent - the lowest in the system.'
"It seems like there's always something, from a sick passenger to signal problems," said Paul Galloway, an F train rider who lives in Brooklyn and works at the Museum of Modern Art. "It just seems like a cursed line to me."
It is clear that the subway is improving after hitting rock bottom in the summer of 2017, when a train derailed in Harlem and the on-time rate dipped below 65 percent - the worst of any major transit system in the world. The subway's leader, Andy Byford, has won accolades for making the system more reliable.
But the diverging fates of the lines represented by letters and numbers can feel like A Tale of Two Subways - a system where some riders see signs of hope while others continue to endure constant pain.
Subway leaders say there are several reasons for the gulf: schedule changes on the numbered lines that boosted the on-time rate; a computer system on the numbered lines that allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains; the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which eased crowding on several numbered lines; and signal upgrades that improved service on another numbered line.
The trend has left some riders wondering how to game the system to get where they are going on time.
"The numbered lines have more stops, but they arrive more regularly and are less prone to problems," said Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and lives near several lines in Brooklyn. "Do you roll the dice and take the ideally faster way, or do you take the way you know is going to work?"
The seven numbered subway lines are on time about 79 percent of the time, compared to about 68 percent for the 15 lettered lines. Trains are considered on time if they reach the final stop within five minutes of the schedule.
One reason the lettered lines are lagging is that they have older equipment. Some lettered lines are slated to get modern signals, which should improve reliability. But Byford's plan to modernize the entire subway will cost billions of dollars, and it is not clear whether state leaders will approve new funding streams for the transit system this year.
Still, every line has improved as part of a broader effort to make trains run faster, said Sally Librera, head of the subways department. Workers are increasing speed limits on parts of the system and replacing faulty signals that slowed trains.
Transit officials point to other statistics that show subway service is improving, including fewer major incidents that delay 50 or more trains.
"We recognize that we have more to do," Librera said. "But we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing."
The subway now has its best on-time rate in four years - a figure that Gov. Andrew Cuomo is highlighting as he presses state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Cuomo, who controls the subway, is also pushing for changes at the transit agency, though the state Senate issued a separate change proposal.
Critics have raised concerns over the schedule changes in late 2017 that made it easier to ensure that certain numbered trains are on time. On the No. 6 line, five trains were eliminated at Grand Central Station in Manhattan during the morning rush from 7 to 9 a.m., according to documents obtained by The New York Times.
There were 68 trains scheduled on the 6 line during the morning rush in June 2017. The number fell to 63 last year. The on-time rate for the 6 train jumped to 72 percent in January, up from 52 percent in September 2017.
"I'm inherently skeptical when they say we changed the schedule, and now everything is running on time," Kabak said. "You're running the risk of padding the schedule."
Subway officials denied padding the schedule and said the changes were needed to accurately reflect how long it took to route trains through the system.
"Adjusting schedules to accurately reflect actual system conditions allows for less train congestion and faster, more reliable service," said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system. "This, along with other significant factors such as the $800 million Subway Action Plan and deliberately improved operating procedures, have led to the recent subway performance gains."
Though fewer trains are scheduled, the same number of trains are running on the 6 line during the morning rush - an average of about 61 trains, Young said. Officials also cut service on the No. 1 and 5 lines, which each lost two scheduled trains in midtown Manhattan during the morning rush.
While fewer trains could help raise the on-time performance, they also can lead to more crowded trains and less capacity on the system. Each train can carry roughly 1,000 passengers.
Most riders never learned about the schedule changes. The authority's board did not approve them because they only vote on "major" service changes, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority. The schedule changes on the numbered lines were considered "minor," and the board was merely notified.
An investigation by The New York Times in 2017 revealed that the transit agency was running fewer trains. The Lexington Avenue line, which carries the 4, 5 and 6 trains, regularly failed to meet its schedule, effectively canceling dozens of trains and reducing the system's capacity by tens of thousands of riders. At Grand Central Station, just 77 of 90 scheduled trains regularly ran through the stop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.
For years, the lettered trains actually had better on-time rates than the numbered trains, but that shifted in January 2018, shortly after the schedule changes took effect. Librera cited two other factors behind the resurgence: The Second Avenue line opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January 2017, drawing riders who had previously used the overburdened 4, 5 and 6 lines, which boosted the on-time rate for those lines. New signals on the No. 7 line also improved service.
Most experts agree that the system is bouncing back. Andrew Albert, a board member who represents riders, said he noticed trains running faster along the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan where they used to move at a snail's pace.
"Absolutely, it's getting better," he said. "I'm thwarted less often, and I notice the running times are much faster."

If you had the money, would you pay off a college admissions officer? 1 in 4 parents say they would, a new poll finds

Texto completo: If you had the money, would you bribe a college official to get your child admitted?
Fifteen percent of all American adults would answer yes, according to a new poll. And that number rises to 25 percent for adults who actually have children ages 18 and under.
It’s a hypothetical question, but certainly a revealing ethical one. There’s been a flood of outrage over the recent college admissions scandal, in which federal prosecutors charged parents with everything from paying off testing proctors to lying about their child’s athletic abilities to win a spot at elite schools. But a new poll from YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, shows that a large percentage of the U.S. population certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility of cheating and bribery when it comes to college admissions.
“It speaks to the pressure of parenting a bit,” said Larry Shannon-Missal, head of data services in the U.S. for YouGov. “Parents are aware of how increasingly competitive it is out there. They’re all reading the same articles we are about kids coming out of college and moving back in with their parents because it’s hard to find jobs that will pay enough to get a living wage.”
Even more parents — 34 percent — said they would be willing to pay someone to take an entrance exam on behalf of their child to get him or her into a good college. Of the general public, 20 percent said they would do so.
Shannon-Missal said these findings might also speak to a level of cynicism among the general population: that people see the wealthy using their resources to take advantage of the higher education system and would therefore be more likely to think that they themselves should also be able to do so, if they had the resources.
About two-thirds of adults polled said they were not surprised at the cheating scandal, and a similar number said the system is rigged in favor of wealthy students. In fact, 44 percent of adults said that, if given the money, most parents would pay to get their kids ahead.
Steering students toward specific extracurricular and academic tracks designed to catch the eye of admissions officers is not uncommon and is available at sky-high prices. A recent New York Times profile of college consultants reported that costs for these services can reach into the millions of dollars. And rigorous, expensive test prep for entrance exams remains at the center of debates around equity and inclusion.
It’s worth noting that the majority of respondents said they would not cheat: About three-quarters said they would probably or definitely not pay off a high school or college official. But if they had the money, 72 percent said they would likely pay for tutoring or test prep to get their child into college.
While the two most high-profile participants accused in the scheme — celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — are women, the survey found that more men than women were willing to cheat in the college admissions race. When it came to paying someone to take a college entrance exam for their child, 23 percent of men said they probably or definitely would, compared with 17 percent of women. And 19 percent of men said they would probably or definitely pay a college official to secure their child a spot, versus 12 percent of women.
Some survey questions asked whether the respondent would hypothetically cheat if given the resources, but when other questions inquired as to whether they have actually cheated to get themselves or their children ahead, very few said they had. Only 2 percent said they’ve paid someone to gain an advantage for their child. Only 10 percent admitted to having personally cheated on a pop quiz, and 5 percent said they’ve cheated on a final exam.
“There are a lot of things that people could see, under the right circumstances, being willing to go to an extreme (for), but that doesn’t mean that most people have found that set of circumstances that has driven them to do so,” Shannon-Missal said.
The survey is weighted and representative of U.S. adults. It was conducted online from March 13 and 14 and included 1,259 respondents. The margin of error was 2.76 percentage points.

Texto completo: OUR MOVIE RATINGS: * Skip it; **So-so; ***Good; **** Excellent
Alita: Battle Angel' ***
PG-13 - 2:22 - This film entry into the manga world of artist Yukito Kishiro, imagined for the screen by producer James Cameron and director Robert Rodriguez, crams in so many plot lines that it risks being overstuffed. Yet it somehow stays true to its mesmerizing vision and emerges as a sci-fi success, if not a triumph. Associated Press
'Arctic' ***½
PG-13 - 1:38 - Overgard (Mads Mikkelsen) crash-lands his plane in the Arctic and struggles to survive. It's the kind of film that might make you want to sign up for a wilderness survival class as soon as you walk out. Associated Press
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Captain Marvel' **
PG-13 - 2:04 - Marvel's first female-led film tells the story of a woman overcoming her own self-doubt and the forces that control her to discover latent powers that can literally save the world. It's just the kind of feminist myth we need when our male leaders seem so feckless. Washington Post
'Captive State'
PG-13 - 1:49 - The residents of a Chicago neighborhood carry on after a decade of occupation by extraterrestrial forces. With John Goodman, Machine Gun Kelly, KiKi Layne, D.B. Sweeney, Vera Farmiga. Directed by Rupert Wyatt. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'Climax' ***
R - 1:35 - French provocateur and filmmaker Gaspar NoÃ© plunges the audience into the center of what becomes the worst dance party ever when LSD is added to the mix. Tribune News Service
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Everybody Knows' ***½
R - 2:12 - Members of a large extended family and their friends gather in Spanish wine country to celebrate a wedding, but the focus turns to a teen girl's disappearance. Starring Javier Bardem and PenÃ©lope Cruz. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Fighting With My Family' ***
PG-13 - 1:48 - Siblings raised by WWE-obsessed parents aspire to the big-time while participating in the family's regional, ragtag wrestling business. The solo writing-directing debut of Stephen Merchant ("The Office") is based on a true story and a colorful documentary. Associated Press
'Five Feet Apart' ***
PG-13 - 1:56 - The cystic fibrosis romantic drama feels like a real evolution in the sick-teen movie genre, because it's actually a great movie that just happens to be about sick teens, and it doesn't condescend to or try to cheer up anyone. Tribune News Service
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'Greta' *
R - 1:38 - Psychological thriller starring ChloÃ« Grace Moretz is a maddeningly mixed bag. With nods to "Fatal Attraction" and "Single White Female" -- not to mention homages to Brian De Palma -- "Greta" feels as time-warped as its title character's cozy but slightly confining apartment. Washington Post
'Happy Death Day 2U' **½
PG-13 - 1:40 - Unnecessary sequel actually does a bit more than just regurgitate "Happy Death Day" (2017), posing questions that other slasher films wouldn't touch. Washington Post
'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' **½
PG - 1:44 - Third movie brings the franchise to a close with an affectionate chapter that continues the adventures of the Viking boy-turned-chief Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his faithful dragon, Toothless. Associated Press
'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' ***
PG - 1:46 - The innocent-looking Lego Duplo characters introduced in the first movie turn into invading space aliens in the sequel. Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Tiffany Haddish, Charlie Day and more. Chicago Tribune
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' ****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'Triple Frontier'
R - 2:05 - Set in an unnamed area of Latin America, the core story is a heist movie of the familiar "one last job" variety. Starring Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund. No star rating provided. Los Angeles Times
'Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral'
PG-13 - 1:42 - Tyler Perry reprises his role as the cantankerous matriarch in this entry in the comedy franchise. With Cassi Davis, Patrice Lovely. Written and directed by Perry. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'What Men Want' *
R - 1:57 - Taraji P. Henson tries a little too hard in a predictable, gender-switching remake of the 2000 romantic comedy "What Women Want." This time, a woman unlocks the power to read men's minds. Associated Press
'Woman at War' ***
NR - 1:41 - A woman named Halla (Halldora Geirharosdottir) has a single quest: to protest the Icelandic government's cooperation with polluting corporations, in this case by temporarily paralyzing an aluminum smelter. Washington Post
'Wonder Park' **
PG - 1:25 - Animated film takes place in an amusement park dreamed up by a mother and daughter who whisper ideas into the ear of a stuffed chimp. But all the movie's wonder disappears when there's an illness in the family. Tribune News Service
'Yardie'
NR - 1:41 - Idris Elba directs this drama about a Jamaican man in 1980s Britain seeking revenge for his older brother's murder years earlier in Kingston. With Ami Ameen, Shantol Jackson, Stephen Graham. Based on a novel by Victor Headley. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times

Texto completo: One problem with the Trump-Russia investigation is that the facts continue to be released in dribs and drabs. The unreleased House transcript of the testimony of James Baker, former general counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is Exhibit A for why it is so crucial for Americans to get full documentation, and soon.
Bits of the Baker transcript have leaked, including a few explosive lines about the FBI's musings over removing President Trump via the 25th Amendment. But it's his Oct. 3 and Oct. 18 interviews as a whole, which I have obtained, that make for revealing reading. Former Director James Comey worked hard in his own interview to play dumb regarding what the FBI knew about the political hit men who fed the bureau information about the Trump campaign. Mr. Baker was far more candid.
Mr. Comey and others at the FBI like to tell a tale in which the FBI obtained its dossier of Trump allegations via controlled interactions with one "reliable" source -- dossier author Christopher Steele. Mr. Baker makes clear the FBI knew that Glenn Simpson, head of the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS, was papering Washington with his scandalous material -- which the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign paid him to have Mr. Steele gather.
"My understanding at the time was that Simpson was going around Washington giving this out to a lot of different people and trying to elevate its profile," Mr. Baker testified. More important, the FBI understood it was the target of this pressure campaign. Mr. Baker acknowledges there were "various copies of the dossier floating around Washington," and that they were all being funneled to the FBI.
Mr. Baker explains that top FBI leadership was told Justice Department attorney Bruce Ohr "had some type of relationship" with Mr. Steele and "that somehow through that mechanism . . . information was flowing to the FBI." He says that his "longtime friend," the liberal Mother Jones reporter David Corn, also fed the FBI the dossier. "I know that David was anxious to get this into the hands of FBI. And being the person at the FBI that he knew the best, he wanted to give it to me." Mr. Baker admits that he "assumed" Mr. Corn got it from "Simpson or somebody acting on Simpson's behalf." He further admits a lawyer with ties to the DNC, Michael Sussmann, also passed along to Mr. Baker documents with Trump-Russia accusations.
The former general counsel even tacitly acknowledges that the dossier crowd knew exactly what it was doing in choosing its funnels. Evidence doesn't normally flow to the bureau through Justice Department lawyers or FBI general counsels. But Mr. Baker says that because of Mr. Ohr's "pre-existing relationship" with Mr. Steele, the FBI allowed Justice to play backchannel. And as part of questioning as to why other outsiders chose to come to him of all people, Mr. Baker admits that, well, anything coming from the general counsel's office would be taken seriously.
Mr. Comey and other FBI defenders also like to say the FBI had no reason to doubt Mr. Steele's reliability or motives, or to think the FBI might be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Comey declared in his own House testimony that "I don't even remember hearing the name Fusion GPS" and that it "didn't matter" who funded the work. But Mr. Baker's testimony makes clear the FBI was highly aware of Mr. Simpson and his reputation, and of the risk all this would blow up. The general counsel explained that the FBI's application to eavesdrop on Carter Page through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was one of the few he ever personally reviewed. Why? Because it was "sensitive" and "controversial" and targeted a person with "connections to a candidate for the office of President of the United States."
That, Mr. Baker said, was also why in its FISA application "we were obligated to talk about Simpson and what the hell we knew about him" -- namely to "alert the [FISA] court to the fact that there were a range of issues with respect to the providence [sic] of this information and the relationship that we had with respect to Mr. Simpson and his credibility." Mr. Baker nonetheless fails to explain how that "range of issues" was communicated via the obscure footnote the FBI ultimately included in its application, which vouched for Mr. Steele and made only vague reference to an "identified U.S. Person" who might (or might not) have political motives.
As to Mr. Sussmann and his documents, Mr. Baker similarly says he "was concerned about the nature of this material from the first instance." He knew Mr. Sussmann was involved with the DNC and had also given his documents to the New York Times. Yet the FBI appears to have generally closed its eyes and ears to just how thoroughly it was being played.
The Baker interview is itself peppered with references to other documents -- emails, FBI interviews, the file used to support the FISA application. It's past time Americans got the full story.

BAM AND TRIPLE CANOPY: ON RESENTMENT at BAM Rose Cinemas (through March 28). The theater collaborates with the magazine Triple Canopy for this brief but wide-ranging exploration of antipathy onscreen -- and in particular, movies in which anger boils over into rebellion. The theme is explored through the lenses of domestic discord in Iran ("A Separation," on Saturday), an allegorical boarding-school uprising ("If ....," on Sunday), poverty and worker mistreatment in the Philippines ("Manila in the Claws of Light," on Sunday), the Maze prison hunger strike in Northern Ireland ("Hunger," on Monday), and race-based violence in a dystopian version of Britain ("Welcome II the Terrordome," on Tuesday).

HARMONY KORINE at the Metrograph (March 22-31). Korine was only 22 when Larry Clark's "Kids" (on Monday and Tuesday), for which he wrote the screenplay, became a cultural flash point because of its depiction of sex and H.I.V. among New York City teenagers. He was only 24 when Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, declared his feature directorial debut, "Gummo" (on Sunday and Monday), the worst film of 1997 (with two and a half months to spare). Whether Korine should be seen as a juvenile troll or a bold fringe artist has continued to be a subject of debate, with "Trash Humpers" (on Friday and Saturday), a VHS-shot provocation that chronicles the antics of a group of wrinkle-masked mischief makers, offering the best evidence for both positions. The delightful "Spring Breakers" (on Friday and Saturday) opened a path to mainstream appeal, a direction Korine heads further down with his new stoner comedy, "The Beach Bum," starring Matthew McConaughey and opening on March 29.

MADE IN HARLEM: FILMS OF MADELINE ANDERSON at Shepard Hall, City College of New York (March 28, 6:30 p.m.). For women's history month, the Maysles Cinema and the Documentary Forum, a center at City College, will present three short films by Anderson, who will participate in a Q. and A. after the screening. "Integration Report 1" (1960) examines the state of school integration in three cities; "A Tribute to Malcolm X" aired on TV two years after the civil rights leader's assassination; and "I Am Somebody," from 1970, documents a strike in 1969 by workers at a Charleston, S.C., hospital.
212-537-6843, maysles.org
WHAT THE FEST!? at IFC Center (through March 24). This newish festival highlights contemporary movies that have a focus on horror and other outré happenings. Emma Tammi's "The Wind," showing on Friday and scheduled to open on April 5, is not, as cinephiles have speculated, in any meaningful sense of a remake of Victor Sjostrom's 1928 silent masterpiece "The Wind," but a horror film that nevertheless -- like that Lillian Gish classic -- foregrounds a female protagonist (Caitlin Gerard) against an unforgiving landscape. There are also recent selections from the Sundance Film Festival: "Greener Grass" (on Friday) was received at that event as an off-kilter sendup of suburban living, while "Hail Satan?" (on Sunday) is a very funny documentary on the philosophy and political activity of the group that calls itself the Satanic Temple.

Texto completo: In late October 2017, Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, dropped into Saudi Arabia for an unannounced visit to the desert retreat of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was in the process of consolidating his power. The two men talked privately late into the night.
Just a day earlier, Mr. Kushner's younger brother, Josh, then 32, was flying out of the kingdom.
Jared came to talk policy, but Josh was there on business.
The founder of an eight-year-old venture capital firm, Josh Kushner had spent the three days before his brother's arrival at an investor conference, where Prince Mohammed had promised to spend billions of dollars on a high-tech future for Saudi Arabia.
As others sat through speeches in a gilded conference hall, several participants said, the younger Mr. Kushner frequently ducked out for more exclusive conversations with Saudi officials.
Some government ethics lawyers say those conversations -- never hidden, but not previously reported -- create the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. Although Jared Kushner severed his ties with his brother's company and divested his interest in his brother's funds around the time he entered the White House, he was nonetheless discussing American policy with the rulers of the kingdom at virtually the same time that his brother was talking business with their top aides.
A spokesman for Josh Kushner's firm, Thrive Capital, said that it was not in a formal fund-raising period at the time of the conference. A year later, however, the company raised $1 billion. And two people who spoke with Josh Kushner at the conference said he had been actively promoting a health insurance start-up he founded in 2012, Oscar Health, which five months later announced a fresh $165 million round of financing.
A spokesman for Josh Kushner said the management of Oscar Health knew of no direct investment by Saudis. But the spokesman, Jesse Derris, declined to disclose whether Saudis had invested in any Thrive funds. Mr. Derris said only that Thrive had received no money since the presidential election from any Saudi who had not previously invested in its funds.
"Out of an abundance of caution, Thrive instituted a policy shortly after the 2016 election to prohibit investments from new foreign investors with business in front of the current administration," Mr. Derris said in a statement. "It has abided by that prohibition."
But he declined to answer whether Thrive has continued to receive money from Saudis who began investing before November 2016.
Jared Kushner appears to have been closely involved in Josh's venture capital firm, having sat on the board and investment committees of Thrive Capital until January 2017, his financial disclosure forms show.
He also received at least $8.2 million in capital gains from various Thrive funds while working in the White House, according to a financial disclosure form filed in May 2018.
Whether Jared Kushner was aware of his brother's visit to Riyadh or of any Saudi investment in his brother's funds could not be determined. Spokesmen for the White House and for Jared Kushner's lawyers declined to address those questions publicly.
Jan Baran, a Republican lawyer specializing in government ethics, said an investment in a fund run by Thrive Capital did not appear to pose legal problems for Jared Kushner, unless his role in the White House gave him oversight over matters related to the Saudi investment.
But Kathleen Clark, an expert on government ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Saudi discussions with Josh Kushner raised issues for his brother.
"The timing looks bad, O.K., but the bigger issue is his brother's business," she said. "It is reasonable to question Jared Kushner's ability to be impartial in dealing with the Saudis."
At the time of the conference, Prince Mohammed was basking in favorable attention from many in the West for having taken preliminary steps to open up the kingdom's economy and relax its social codes. The New York Times was one of several media companies that co-sponsored the 2017 investment conference. Several Times journalists attended, and one spoke briefly with Josh Kushner.
But the bond between Jared Kushner, 38, and Prince Mohammed, 33, has drawn more scrutiny as the crown prince has displayed more aggression.
A week after the Kushners left the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Prince Mohammed ordered the extrajudicial detention of about 200 businessmen and former officials in a Ritz-Carlton hotel, some of whom were evidently tortured. He was also behind the bizarre kidnapping of Lebanon's prime minister. And months later, he directed the arrests and, according to relatives, torture of prominent women's rights advocates.
Then, last October, his agents killed and dismembered the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside a consulate in Istanbul -- on the orders of Prince Mohammed, American intelligence agencies concluded.
The crown prince has led a four-year military intervention in Yemen that has brought on a humanitarian catastrophe with no end in sight. At the same time, he has sown division among American allies in the region by trying to isolate Qatar over policy disagreements.
Jared Kushner, though, has steadfastly supported the prince.
From the start of the administration, Mr. Kushner has argued persistently that Prince Mohammed can become a vital ally, especially in bringing the Palestinians into agreement with a promised American peace plan. He pushed past the objections of cabinet members and senior officials to persuade Mr. Trump to visit Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad as president.
And even after a bipartisan backlash over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Kushner argued successfully that Mr. Trump should stand by the prince. Last month, the White House defied a congressional deadline for a report from Mr. Trump about who directed the killing, sidestepping pressure to acknowledge the intelligence findings about Prince Mohammed's role.
Professor Clark said that ethics laws could require Jared Kushner to recuse himself from White House deliberations about the response to those congressional demands or other specific proceedings involving the Saudis.
Not long after the congressional deadline expired, Jared Kushner flew to Riyadh for his first face-to-face meeting with Prince Mohammed since Mr. Khashoggi's death.
Critics of Mr. Trump have often argued that a tacit financial interest hovers over his administration's dealings with the oil-rich rulers of the Persian Gulf, if only because they are major investors in American real estate. Both Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner are expected to go back into the business of selling real estate investments when they leave the White House.
Josh Kushner, however, has largely escaped the scrutiny that has fallen on the Trump administration, in part because he kept his distance. He stepped away from the family business to found his venture capital firm, and he is a Democrat who has said he voted against Mr. Trump despite the family connection.
Supporters of Josh Kushner note that his young firm has scored early wins -- like a timely investment in the photo-sharing app Instagram -- and that he was regularly invited to major tech investment conferences before 2016.
But the Riyadh conference drew Wall Street titans, and some attendees questioned how a relatively small player enjoyed high-level access to Saudi officials. On a list of the top 100 venture capitalists compiled by the trade publication CB Insights in collaboration with The New York Times, Josh Kushner appeared for the first time in 2018, entering at 99.
One of those he met, during an opening night party for V.I.P. guests, was Yasir Al-Rumayyan, an aide to the crown prince and the managing director of the kingdom's vast Public Investment Fund. Another was Mr. Al-Rumayyan's son Faisal, a student at New York University, and two of his associates said that after returning from Riyadh, they socialized together. (A person close to Josh Kushner said the two met face to face only once after the conference.)

Texto completo: The second of my friend Krista's vegetarian bean recipes also comes from the New York Times Cooking, from Ali Slagle. The recipe brings two beans and one head of garlic together simmered in milk for a rich and hearty experience.
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 head garlic, halved crosswise
1 cup whole milk
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, with their liquid
1 (15-ounce) can white beans, such as cannellini or Great Northern, drained and rinsed
1 thyme sprig, 2 sage leaves or 1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg, allspice
or garam masala
Kosher salt and black pepper
4 slices crusty bread or thick toast
Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving
Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving
Aleppo pepper or red-pepper flakes, for serving
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, cut side down, and cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the milk, chickpeas and their liquid, white beans, thyme and nutmeg and stir to combine. Season generously with salt and pepper. When the mixture begins to bubble around the edges of the pan (you don't want it to come to a full boil), reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened and tastes great to you, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Use a fork to remove the garlic halves from the beans. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then use the fork to remove the cloves from the skins. Spread the cloves on bread or toast.
If you would like the beans to be more stew-like, mash some of the beans using a potato masher or the back of a spoon. Serve beans and milk in bowls. Garnish as you wish, with a drizzle of oil, a sprirdde of Parmesan and a pinch of Aleppo pepper and black pepper. Serve with the bread alongside for dipping.
Thank you again Krista!

Texto completo: Border wall, 'El Chapo' conviction will not be the fall of fentanyl market
WASHINGTON -- On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka "El Chapo," was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico's largest. Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry. On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets.
This was two days after Don Winslow published "The Border," the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels ("The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel") about the cartels and the U.S. "war on drugs." He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures. Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong -- body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration -- he has been in custody since 2016 -- will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly -- very thinly -- disguised President Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market -- 30 million consumers of illicit drugs -- must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."
The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick -- and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick. Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl -- just over an ounce and a half -- has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms -- "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" -- can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Texto completo: A high number of female and minority economists say they have faced discrimination and do not feel welcome in the profession, according to a survey released Monday by the American Economic Association that is prompting calls for sweeping changes.
Economics has been going through a #MeToo moment in recent months, and the survey results from more than 9,200 economists are the latest indication the problems are deep and widespread. Almost a quarter of female economists said another economist had made unwanted sexual or romantic advances, despite their best efforts to discourage it.
"We find the results very distressing, said Ben Bernanke, president of AEA and former chair of the Federal Reserve and President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. He said his top priority is to restore "simple decency to economics.
Women have far worse experiences than men, according to the survey. Thirty percent of women economists say they have been discriminated against versus 12 percent of men.
In another question that asked if the respondent had been threatened with retaliation if they didn't agree to sexual advances, nearly 200 women said they had.
The AEA released a letter alongside the survey results Monday that pledged to take numerous actions including the creation of a code of conduct, a policy on harassment and discrimination, and the appointment of a lawyer who is an expert in sexual harassment and discrimination to serve as an ombudsperson that any economist can call and report issues.
"One thing is clear: There is systematic evidence of differences of views between men and women in terms of how valued they feel in the field of economics and whether they're given a fair chance to demonstrate their skills and get promoted, Bernanke said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Overall, only 20 percent of women said they were "satisfied with the culture in the field of economics compared to 40 percent of men, a higher but still troubling percent to Bernanke.
Economics has struggled for years to get more women and minorities into the field. Less than a third of undergraduate economics majors and in PhD programs are women, figures that haven't moved at all since 2000 even as other technical professions like computer science have made gains.
The survey, which includes numerous questions about people's experiences in their careers, was sent to everyone who has been an AEA member in the past nine years, an effort to try to include the views of people who have been so frustrated with economics they left it entirely. The vast majority of respondents teach at colleges and universities, but some also work at companies or for government agencies such as the Federal Reserve.
Some might point out that the response rate was only about 20 percent, but members of the AEA board counter that's better than political polls and note their results echo numerous other studies. The data line up with personal anecdotes from female economists, who have come forward to talk about their experiences being ostracized in nearly all-male departments or outright groped.
"I don't want to see numbers this high. I'm very hopeful that economists are going to look at these numbers and reflect on what they can do, said Marianne Bertrand, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and chair of AEA's Committee on Equity, Diversity and Professional Conduct.
The AEA vows more vetting of economists who serve on the AEA board or receive prestigious awards, and there are changes in the works to AEA bylaws to make it easier to remove someone from the board who violates the code of conduct. Harvard University economics professor Roland Fryer, Jr. was on the AEA board when harassment allegations about him came forward in the New York Times late last year.
The AEA is also working on expanded mentoring programs and anti-bias training for economics department chairs. Many women say problems occur at their universities, which have their own set of rules and norms.
"One of my moves professionally was primarily motivated by a bullying culture in one department, said Susan Athey, an economics professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, at the AEA meeting in early January.
Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair who was often cited as one of the most powerful women in the world, also disclosed in January how she felt discriminated against as a young female professor at Harvard in the early 1970s. None of her male peers would co-author a paper with her, she said.
Yellen will become AEA president in 2020 and has pledged to continue the push to get more women and minorities into the field and to fix the culture of the profession.
Everyone acknowledges it will take time to see major change happen, but many take comfort that there was unanimous support in the survey for the AEA to take action.
"There is appetite for change. It's a society-wide push for change, but it's also happening in economics as well, said Bernanke.

Is Trump really about to attack Venezuela?

Texto completo: Last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ordered the last of the U.S. diplomats out of Venezuela, saying their presence was a “constraint” on U.S. policy toward the country. The wording seemed intended to convey the idea that the U.S. is about to launch military action to place a Washington-backed, self-appointed politician to the presidency. Was it just bluster, designed to intimidate? Or is the Trump Administration really about to invade another country that has neither attacked nor threatened the United States?
While U.S. administrations engaged in “regime change” have generally tried to mask their real intentions, this U.S.-backed coup is remarkable for how honest its backers are being. Not long ago the National Security Advisor to the president, John Bolton, openly admitted that getting U.S. companies in control of Venezuelan oil was the administration’s intent. Trump administration officials have gone so far as mocking the suffering of Venezuelans when a suspiciously-timed nationwide power failure heightened citizens’ misery.
According to media reports, Vice President Mike Pence is angry with the Venezuela coup leader, Juan Guaido, because he promised the whole operation would be a cake walk — just like the neocons promised us about Iraq. Guaido said hundreds of thousands of protesters would follow him to the Colombian border to “liberate” U.S. aid trucks just over the border, but no one showed up. So Pompeo and the neocons made up a lie that Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s thugs burned the aid trucks to prevent the people from getting relief from their suffering. Even the pro-war New York Times finally admitted that the administration was lying: it was opposition protesters who burned the trucks.
Was the U.S. behind the take-down of Venezuela’s power grid? It would not be the first time the CIA pulled such a move, and U.S. officials are open about the U.S. goal of making life as miserable as possible for average Venezuelans in hopes that they overthrow their government.
Congress has to this point been strongly in favor of President Trump’s “regime change” policy for Venezuela. Sadly, even though our neocon foreign policy of interventionism has proven disastrous — from Iraq to Libya to Syria and elsewhere — both parties in Congress continue to act as if somehow this time they will get it right. I have news for them, they won’t.
Even weak congressional efforts to remind the president that Congress must approve military action overseas sound like war cries. In Rep. David N. Cicilline’s, D-Rhode Island, statement introducing his “Prohibiting Unauthorized Military Action in Venezuela Act” last week, he sounded more hawkish than John Bolton or Elliott Abrams! The statement makes all the arguments in favor of a U.S. military attack on Venezuela and then — wink wink — reminds the president he needs authorization beforehand. As if that’s going to be a hard sell!
So is President Trump about to attack Venezuela? At a recent U.S. House hearing, one of the expert witnesses testified that such an invasion would require between 100,000 and 150,000 U.S. troops, going up against maybe three times that number of Venezuelan troops in a country twice the size of Iraq. With a lot of jungle. All for a “prize” that has nothing to do with U.S. security. If the president makes such a foolish move he might find the current war cheerleaders in the Democratic Party changing their tune rather quickly. Let’s hope Trump changes his tune and returns to his promises of no more regime change wars.

Elizabeth Warren Isn't Qualified to Teach History, Either; The 'ideas' candidate is now exploring slavery reparations.

Texto completo: Trailing the Democratic presidential pack in opinion surveys and fundraising, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) is urging Americans to consider a new redistribution of wealth. The basic idea is that the federal government will apportion among the citizens living now the historical guilt for heinous acts committed by people long dead against other people long dead. Then money would flow from people who have not been convicted of any crime to people who have not been found by any court to have been victimized by a crime.
Last night Sen. Warren tweeted :
Slavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it's time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what's right & begin to heal.
What would we do without experts? The reparations idea is always popular in the faculty lounge and occasionally pops up in national political conversation. But generally the debate doesn't last very long because it quickly becomes obvious that even if one wanted to ignore that reparations are incompatible with a justice system which respects the rights of individuals and doesn't hold them accountable for the offenses of others, it would be impossible to implement in the great American melting pot.
Sen. Warren's panel of experts would have to decide, for example, how to categorize someone who is largely white but who may or may not be related to a person of color perhaps six to ten generations earlier. Also, would the experts rely on family lore or only on official records in deciding whose ancestors were guilty and whose were innocent? What if a person is descended from both victims and villains?
Readers may recall that Ms. Warren is the former Harvard law professor pushing an unconstitutional wealth tax and they may now decide that she probably shouldn't be teaching history, either. A few New York Times writers seem to think that she's the "ideas" candidate in the 2020 presidential field. But she seems to have no idea how the nation addressed "head on" the issue of slavery, nor does she seem to understand the price paid to end it.
An organization called American Battlefield Trust, which seeks to preserve the land on which the Civil War was waged, embraces the traditional estimate of 620,000 men killed in uniform. But others believe this total understates the carnage. In 2011 Binghamton University published a story on new research into Civil War casualties by one of its faculty members:
A new analysis of census data suggests that this grisly era was even more costly than experts previously believed. Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker says the war's dead numbered about 750,000, an estimate that's 20 percent higher than the commonly cited figure of 620,000. His findings will be published in December in the journal Civil War History.
"The traditional estimate has become iconic," Hacker says. "It's been quoted for the last hundred years or more. If you go with that total for a minute — 620,000 — the number of men dying in the Civil War is more than in all other American wars from the American Revolution through the Korean War combined. And consider that the American population in 1860 was about 31 million people, about one-tenth the size it is today. If the war were fought today, the number of deaths would total 6.2 million."
The 620,000 estimate, though widely cited, is also widely understood to be flawed. Neither the Union nor the Confederacy kept standardized personnel records. And the traditional estimate of Confederate war dead — 258,000 — was based on incomplete battle reports and a crude guess of deaths from disease and other non-combat causes. "It's probably shocking to most people today that neither army felt any moral obligation to count and name the dead or to notify survivors," Hacker says. "About half the men killed in battles were buried without identification. Most records were geared toward determining troop strength."
...Pulitzer Prize-winner James McPherson, the preeminent living historian of the war, says he finds Hacker's new estimate plausible. "Even if it might not be quite as high as 750,000, I have always been convinced that the consensus figure of 620,000 is too low, and especially that the figure of 260,000 Confederate dead is definitely too low," McPherson says. "My guess is that most of the difference between the estimate of 620,000 and Hacker's higher figure is the result of underreported Confederate deaths."
The higher number means more combat deaths than in all of our country's other wars combined. And the enormous destruction was not confined to those mortally wounded in battle. Leave it to the New York Times to publish more than 3,000 words on the Civil War's environmental impact. In a 2014 Times piece, Brown University administrator Ted Widmer chronicled , among other things, the fate of humans within the American ecosystem:
The war may have begun haltingly, but it soon became total, and in certain instances, a war upon civilians and the countryside as well as upon the opposing forces. Gen. William T. Sherman famously explained that he wanted the people of the South to feel ''the hard hand of war,'' and he cut a wide swath on his march to the sea in November and December 1864. ''We devoured the land,'' he wrote in a letter to his wife.
Gen. Philip H. Sheridan pursued a similar scorched-earth campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in September and October 1864, burning farms and factories and anything else that might be useful to the Confederates. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant told him to ''eat out Virginia clear and clear as far as they go, so that crows flying over it for the balance of the season will have to carry their provender with them.''
Other flying creatures found their provender easily enough, according to Mr. Widmer:
Insects thrived in the camps, in part because the armies destroyed the forest habitats of the birds, bats and other predators that would keep pest populations down. Mosquitoes carried out their own form of aerial attack upon unsuspecting men from both sides. More than 1.3 million soldiers in the Union alone were affected by mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and yellow fever. An Ohio private. Isaac Jackson, wrote, ''the skeeters here are -- well, there is no use talking ... I never seen the like.'' Flies, ticks, maggots and chiggers added to the misery.
The army camps were almost designed to attract them. Fetid latrines and impure water bred disease and did more to weaken the ranks than actual warfare. Some 1.6 million Union troops suffered from diarrhea and dysentery; Southern numbers were surely proportional. Rats were abundantly present on both sides, carrying germs and eating their way through any food they could find.
Probably the worst places of all were the prisoner camps. A Massachusetts private, Amos Stearns, wrote a two-line poem from his confinement in South Carolina: ''A Confederate prison is the place/Where hunting for lice is no disgrace.'' Some Alabama prisoners in a New York prison made a stew of the prison's rat population. (''They taste very much like a young squirrel,'' wrote Lt. Edmund D. Patterson.)
It's a safe bet that Sen. Warren has never suffered as captured soldiers did in that era, so perhaps she has not considered the price already paid.
The American Battlefield Trust notes that available records of wounded soldiers did not include the full impact of the national trauma on those who survived:
Our modern conception of casualties includes those who have been psychologically damaged by warfare. This distinction did not exist during the Civil War. Soldiers suffering from what we would now recognize as post-traumatic stress disorder were uncatalogued and uncared for.
Approximately one in four soldiers that went to war never returned home. At the outset of the war, neither army had mechanisms in place to handle the amount of death that the nation was about to experience. There were no national cemeteries, no burial details, and no messengers of loss.
And among politicians like Sen. Warren, there seems to be no recognition of the horrors of the Civil War.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rep. Steve King posted a meme Saturday about a hypothetical civil war between "blue states" fighting over which bathroom to use and "red states" with trillions of bullets.
The post is an image of two figures composed of traditionally Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states in fighting postures with text superimposed over the top. The caption reads: "Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use."
"Wonder who would win?" the Iowa Republican wrote on Facebook.
The post was later deleted.
The image appears to have originated in a 2013 New York Times Book Review by Michael Kinsley titled "War of Umbrage."
King's post comes at a time Muslim civil rights leaders and others have urged for political leaders to be thoughtful in their rhetoric in light of the mass shooting targeting two New Zealand mosques last week that left at least 50 people dead.
King may have posted the meme without much deliberation, as it escaped his notice that Iowa is pictured as a "blue state."
The post follows lobbying by King for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to reinstate him to congressional committee posts.
King was stripped of committee assignments by congressional leadership following years of white nationalist statements, most recently in an interview with The New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King said in the January article.
King disputes the quote in a letter to McCarthy that he has asked supporters to endorse.
"The New York Times misquoted me and misrepresented my beliefs as a freedom-loving American," King wrote.
The form letter also includes a button to donate to the King for Congress political committee.
King was defiant in a February interview with Iowa Public Television insisting, "I have nothing to apologize for."
While King disavowed white nationalism, he argued that term has been "weaponized by the left" to mean racism, but didn't give his definition of the term.
King has often voiced the far-right theory that immigration and diversity will lead to a collapse of Western civilization. Advocacy groups dedicated to rooting out hate speech say "Western civilization" used in that context is a euphemism for whites.

Pentagon lobbying for more lenient cleanup standard for toxic chemicals in El Paso County aquifer, report says

Texto completo: The Pentagon is reportedly lobbying for a more lenient standard for cleaning up toxic chemicals used for decades in firefighting foam that have been found in drinking water in southern El Paso County and around the country.
Even if the Pentagon is successful, the Air Force appears unlikely to get off the hook for cleaning up the contaminated Widefield aquifer serving tens of thousands of residents south of Colorado Springs, state health officials said.
The Defense Department’s push to revise safety standards comes as it faces billions of dollars in cleanup costs tied to its decades-long use of a firefighting foam laced with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The chemicals, known as PFAS, are tied to cancer, liver disease and low infant birth weight.
The lobbying appears aimed at influencing the Environmental Protection Agency’s groundwater cleanup standard — a level at which cleanup would be required of polluters.
In a report to Congress, the Pentagon said an appropriate level is 380 parts per trillion, the New York Times reported. It’s at least five times what the EPA says could be harmful to people, and dozens of times higher than another federal agency says is toxic to people.
At that level, the military could avoid paying to clean up many contaminated sites across the nation, said David Andrews, senior scientist for the Washington D.C.-based Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group.
“Even if it’s the same number of sites, the amount of cleanup you’re doing at each site would be drastically reduced,” Andrews said. “The likely impact is that DoD is really trying to pass on the responsibilities and the cost for cleaning up this contamination. Which is dreadful.”
In a statement, the Pentagon said it takes its cleanup responsibility “seriously.”
“DOD is not seeking a different or weaker cleanup standard but wants the standard risk-based cleanup approach that is based on science and applies to everyone,” the statement said.
Still, one of Delaware’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tom Carper, claimed in a letter to the EPA that the Defense Department is currently only cleaning up sites where groundwater readings exceed 400 parts per trillion, and only removing the chemicals to 70 ppt. The Pentagon was joined by NASA and the Small Business Administration in lobbying for more relaxed standards, the senator said.
The Pentagon report only referenced two PFAS varieties — PFOA and PFOS — even though thousands of other varieties are known to exist. The report was issued last year, and reported Thursday by The New York Times, along with Carper’s letter.
The Defense Department’s maneuvering is expected to have little impact on cleanup operations around Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado health officials say.
State regulations would still force the Air Force to clean up the tainted Widefield aquifer to a more stringent standard that is in line with the EPA’s current health advisory, according to Kelly MacGregor, a Colorado Department of Health and Environment spokeswoman.
The state’s Water Quality Control Commission voted unanimously in April to adopt a site-specific groundwater quality standard of 70 ppt for the same two chemicals — PFOA and PFOS — combined.
Even without the state standard, the aquifer’s contamination downstream from the base is so bad that cleanup efforts around Peterson would likely go unaffected by the Pentagon’s lobbying.
Seven wells drilled about three years ago in the Widefield aquifer showed PFOS at levels of 400 ppt or greater. One well drilled at the Colorado Springs Airport found the chemical at 1,600 ppt.
Neither the state’s adopted groundwater standard, nor lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., touch on the thousands of other types of chemicals, also called perfluorinated compounds.
For communities affected by use of the foam, such as Security, Widefield and Fountain, that could be a significant problem, Andrews said.
For example, another type of chemical called PFHxS is often associated with use of the firefighting foam. And no other type of perfluorinated compound was as common in drinking water samples taken from Security or Fountain wells as PFHxS, nor present at such high levels, according to EPA drinking water data.
A couple of other chemicals were reported as frequently in wells serving Widefield. But again, none were as consistently high as PFHxS.
It also has been found in the drinking water of dozens of other water districts across the country, EPA results show. The federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says it could cause liver damage and a decreased ability to respond to vaccines.
Several other types of PFAS also have raised health concerns while being found in water systems across the country.
“Really we’d like to see the EPA and the DoD focusing on reducing the total PFAS contamination ... shifting into high gear and taking responsibility for cleaning up all of this contamination,” Andrews said.
The military has previously avoided addressing the foam, despite concerns about its toxicity. A Gazette investigation in 2016 found the Air Force ignored decades of warnings about the foam’s dangers, including studies by its own researchers dating to the 1970s that showed chemicals like those in the foam were harmful to laboratory animals.
Congress has allocated tens of millions of dollars from the Defense Department to address contamination in El Paso County, including helping install treatment plants for water districts and filters on private wells.
But local water districts have been stuck with another roughly $9.5 million in unreimbursed costs, which the Air Force says it cannot pay back. The Security Water District and the Pikes Peak Community Foundation, which owns Venetucci Farm, recently filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. government seeking at least $18.3 million in past and future costs related to the contamination.
Also, the Air Force is in the midst of a yearslong process to address the chemicals that is similar to the federal Superfund program. Air Force officials issued a report in summer 2017 that admitted chemicals from the foam had leached into the surrounding groundwater. A follow-up report with more test data is expected to be finalized in May.
Even more studies must be completed before any cleanup takes place, however, and they have yet to be funded by Congress, Peterson officials said. Cleanup of the aquifer is not expected until the 2020s, if Congress allocates money for it.

'A dystopian playground': Hudson Yards, New York City's new $25 billion urban complex, draws mixed reviews

Resumen: The new $25 billion urban complex in Manhattan has its share of critics.

Texto completo: "Hudson Yards has become the cultural center of Manhattan’s New West Side," the $25 billion urban complex's website notes − though it seems that depends on what one defines as New York culture.
The new complex "is the largest real estate development" in the city since Rockefeller Center was built in the 1930s, according to the New York Transit Museum. It includes everything from condos to clothing stores to restaurants, as well as eye-catching installations, including a large spiral staircase dubbed the "Vessel," which includes 154 interconnecting flights of stairs.
For all its ambition, the complex has its share of critics.
"The physical space Hudson Yards has created is ostentatious and energizing, but the social space it has created is illusory and inauthentic," write infrastructure consultants Ellis Talton and Remington Tonar in Forbes. "A truly equitable space, one that honors the values of eclecticism and imperfection that have made New York great, would be less concerned about matching the grandeur of Dubai or Singapore and more focused on matching the dynamism of New York City culture. This can certainly be done on a grandiose and spectacular scale, but the architectural approach needs to be social not just structural. "
The New York Times' Michael Kimmelman puts in more bluntly: "It is, at heart, a supersized suburban-style office park, with a shopping mall and a quasi-gated condo community targeted at the 0. 1 percent. "
People couldn't help poke fun of Hudson Yards (and the Vessel specifically, with Eater calling it a giant shawarma, for instance).
"'The Vessel'at Hudson Yards, a $200 million staircase that doesn’t actually take you anywhere, owns every photo you take inside it," Scott Bixby wrote on Twitter.
"Now that we're seeing Hudson Yards is a dystopian playground for the dull rich we should note that's exactly what Amazon's Queens campus would've been like," wrote another user.
"Unless you were like professionally required to be there or dropped off a couple dozen rats for fun I don’t understand why anyone went to Hudson Yards," wrote poster Heidi Vanderlee.
Not everyone was as harsh. The New York Post praised the Vessel, for instance, in a headline: "Why the Hudson Yards Vessel is $200M worth of glistening glory," and author Zachary Kussin wrote, " . . . the cherry on top comes at the summit, 150 feet above ground, when you suddenly see the spire of the Empire State Building. "
And some social media users actually liked Hudson Yards.
"We came We climbed #TheVessel And I got my 10,000 steps," wrote Monica Kirkland.
User Christina Cuevas wrote: "#HudsonYards looks breathtakingly beautiful and I need to go asap. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – It was supposed be the final act in Paul Manafort’s bruising, 17-month odyssey through the criminal-justice system.
In the end, Wednesday’s sentencing hearing for the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign only added to the now-convicted felon’s legal misery.
U. S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson began her remarks to a packed courtroom by characterizing Manafort as a serial “liar” whose “ongoing contempt” for the law spanned more than a decade. It got worse from there.
Jackson delivered a searing critique of the one-time counselor to Republican presidents, whose high-flying lobbying work paid for expensive clothes and homes, who now is convicted of conspiracy, fraud and plotting to obstruct justice. Then she tacked more than three years onto a four-year prison term he received last week in a related case in Virginia.
And the bad news for Manafort did not stop at the threshold of Jackson’s second-floor courtroom.
Even as Manafort, who now uses a wheelchair because of declining health, was rolled into custody of U. S. Marshals, New York state authorities announced a 16-count indictment charging him with mortgage fraud and conspiracy, arising from the same conduct prosecuted by federal authorities.
Wednesday's developments offered a vivid illustration of the danger facing at least some of the high-profile subjects of Russia special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. As Mueller's inquiry grinds toward its conclusion, federal and state prosecutors are in the midst of their own investigations – many sprawling far beyond the bounds of Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Manafort's fate on Wednesday suggested the peril they face is real, and at least partly beyond Trump's control.
The strategically timed action by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance would put Manafort beyond the reach of a potential pardon, should President Donald Trump choose to set aside the federal convictions against his former aide.
Trump said Wednesday that he felt "very badly" for Manafort, adding that he was not aware of the new charges filed in New York. Trump also did not immediately address a possible pardon.
But as recently as late last year, Trump said he "wouldn't take (the possibility of a pardon) off the table. "
"Why would I take it off the table?" Trump told The New York Post in November.
Sentenced (again): Paul Manafort sentenced to a total of 7. 5 years in prison: 'It is hard to overstate the number of lies'
Charged (again): Ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort, just sentenced to federal prison, faces new charges in N. Y. indictment
In Manafort's case, the question of such presidential intervention has never been especially distant. Just last month, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told Jackson that Manafort lied to investigators despite an existing cooperation agreement as a possible way to “augment his chances for a pardon. ”
Trump and those around him face a multiplying set of investigations.
In addition to the New York state charges lodged against Manafort, federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating fundraising irregularities involving the Trump Inaugural Committee and hush-money payments made by the president, Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization financial chief Allen Weisselberg to women who have claimed affairs with the president.
The Trump Foundation, a charity established by Trump long before he took office, also has been the subject of a separate investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office. More recently, according to The New York Times, the New York attorney general issued subpoenas to two banks as part of a separate examination of the Trump Organization, the president's sprawling real-estate enterprise.
And beyond the myriad criminal inquiries, several congressional investigations have gathered fresh momentum following the recent testimony of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who asserted that the president had indirectly advised him to lie to Congress about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a lucrative real-estate development in Moscow. The lawyer also publicly accused his former boss of inflating the value of his assets to get bank loans and insurance coverage.
The timing of the state charges against Manafort, however, were particularly striking, analysts said.
Patrick Cotter, a white-collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor in New York, characterized the action as "extraordinary. "
“It’s uncommon in the sense that, usually, if the feds take (a case), the state usually leaves it alone," Cotter said. "If the state is interested in addressing state crimes, more often than not, they sort of work with the feds and come up with a global resolution that addresses both state and federal issues. "
In Manafort's case, the action appeared to be designed as a back-stop to a possible presidential pardon.
Cotter said he doesn't think the new charges would place Manafort in an endless legal jeopardy, suggesting that Manafort's attorneys would likely try to reach a plea deal with the New York prosecutors that would result in little or no additional time in prison.
“You can only punish a guy so many times,” he said.
Jason Maloni, a Manafort spokesman, declined to comment on the New York state action.
Manafort's attorneys also did not address the new charges.
Instead, they blasted Judge Jackson, asserting that the additional 3. 5-year prison sentence was excessive, while describing her public rebuke of Manafort's conduct as unnecessary.
“The judge displayed a level of callousness and hostility that I have not seen before,” attorney Kevin Downing said outside the courthouse where he was partially shouted down by protesters.
Indeed, Jackson's verbal scolding of Manafort was often-merciless and struck a decidedly different tone than last week's sentencing in Virginia, where U. S. District Judge T. S. Ellis III, said the former political operative had led "an otherwise blameless life" before pronouncing a sentence of 47 months for convictions on eight counts of tax and bank fraud.
The prison term represented a dramatic departure from federal guidelines that recommended a sentence of between 19. 5 and 24. 5 years. Few federal defendants get prison sentences so far below the guidelines unless prosecutors ask for it.
Jackson, by contrast, delivered a withering admonishment, asserting that Manafort spent much of his career “gaming the system,” lying to government officials and cheating taxpayers of more than $6 million in unpaid taxes.
“It is hard to overestimate the number of lies, the amount of fraud and the extraordinary amount of money involved,” Jackson said before pronouncing sentence.
All of it, the judge said, was aimed at propping up an “opulent” lifestyle that included “more homes than one family can occupy and more suits than one man can wear. ”
During Manafort's federal trial in Virginia, prosecutors offered the testimony from a parade of witnesses who detailed how the veteran political consultant funneled money from dozens of foreign bank accounts to purchase homes, cars and racks of designer clothes from select haberdashers in Manhattan. They showed jurors photos of the clothes FBI agents found in his closet.
As he did at his sentencing earlier this month, Manafort addressed the court from his wheelchair Wednesday, expressing remorse for his actions.
"The person who I have been described as in public is not the someone who I recognize," Manafort said in a raspy voice as a packed courtroom fell silent.
Among those watching shoulder-to-shoulder in the gallery were nearly all of the Mueller team members – FBI agents, prosecutors and paralegals – absent Mueller himself.
"While I know that I am not that person, I feel shame and embarrassment for the suffering that i have caused my family and friends and all who have been affected by my behavior.
"Let me be very clear," he said, "I accept responsibility for the acts that have caused me to be here today. "
In one last appeal, Manafort referred to his wife, Kathleen, seated just a few yards behind the defense table, asking that the judge sentence him to no more additional prison time than the 47 months leveled last week in Virginia.
“Your honor, I will be 70 years old in a few weeks,” Manafort said, adding that he remained his wife's primary caretaker. “Please, let me and my wife be together. "
Jackson appeared unmoved by the emotional display.
"This defendant knew better, and he knew exactly what he was doing,” the judge said, adding that she did not believe Manafort's apology was genuine.
"Saying I’m sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency. "
Then, later Wednesday, she inflicted one more indignity, signing an order turning over several of his homes and bank accounts to federal authorities. Among them, an estate in the Hamptons and his condo in Trump's eponymous New York tower.

George F. Will: Worse living through chemistry

Texto completo: Washington • On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka “El Chapo,” was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico’s largest. Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry. On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets. This was two days after Don Winslow published “The Border,” the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels (“The Power of the Dog” and “The Cartel”) about the cartels and the U.S. “war on drugs.” He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures. Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong — body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. “supermax” prison, and his incarceration — he has been in custody since 2016 — will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels’ billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly — very thinly — disguised President Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market — 30 million consumers of illicit drugs — must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, “so much cash,” Winslow says, “they don’t even count it, they weigh it.” But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, “Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled.”
The “supply side” attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The “demand side” is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick -- and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick. Says New York University’s Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today’s prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. “Fifty grams of fentanyl — just over an ounce and a half — has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it’s way, way cheaper.” Three hundred micrograms — “roughly the weight of a grain of table salt” — can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is “still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis.” And “the fentanyls aren’t going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they’re just the first.” Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow’s epic.

Texto completo: A popular traveling exhibit that uses real human bodies dipped in plastic to teach anatomy and life science is returning to Michigan this fall.
The "Bodies Revealed" exhibit, which opens at the Grand Rapids Public Museum on Nov. 16, features preserved "real, whole and partial body specimens." Tickets are expected to go on sale in the fall.
It will be the first time the exhibit has returned to Grand Rapids in nearly a decade.
Kate Kocienski, the vice president of marketing and public relations at the museum, told the Free Press that "Bodies Revealed" is on tour by a company called Premier Exhibitions, Inc., and the bodies have been maintained via a "polymer preservation process."
The museum's page for the exhibit said that more than a dozen full human bodies and hundreds of organs will be "respectfully displayed to tell the story of the miraculous systems at work within each of us."
"Bodies Revealed allows people to learn about their own bodies and, ultimately, teach how to take better care of one's own health and make positive lifestyle choices," the site said.
The museum said people of all ages are welcome to observe the skeletal, muscular, nervous, digestive, respiratory, reproductive and circulatory systems, and added that many of the specimens will be in "vivid athletic poses" that offer an understanding of "everyday motions and activities."
Other body specimens on-site will illustrate damage that can be caused by habits, like overeating, smoking and lacking exercise, the site said.
In the past, similar displays have generated controversy, as reported by news outlets from around the world — including, the Irish Times, BBC, The New York Times, NPR and more — largely because of questions about how these individuals died and whether or not the bodies were used with consent.
The bodies that will be on display at the Grand Rapids Public Museum in the fall were donated with consent for the remains to be used for medical research, including public education, Kocienski said. She added the bodies have come from universities in China, primarily from Nanjing Medical University.
This is also not the first time exhibitions like this have come to Michigan museums to drum up interest in science, anatomy and health.
According to the Huffington Post, a traveling exhibit that also featured preserved human bodies, called "Bodies Human," came to the Michigan Science Center in 2012. It was one of the special exhibits promoted as marking the re-opening of the science center, which the Huffington Post reported, was formerly known as the Detroit Science Center and closed in 2011 because of financial issues.

Apology owed for ICE agent at KCMS

Texto completo: If you were born in 1968 or before, you've spent most of your adult life in American without any awareness of ICE. Because it didn't exist. There was no entity called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It was only created in 2003.
Before that time, we had immigrations officials who dealt with cases of people overstaying their visa or being in the country illegally. We had the FBI to investigate criminal issues related to terrorism as it relates to trade, travel and immigration.
ICE is a modern creation, an experiment. It's one we should regret.
The agents of ICE and the Border Patrol who conduct raids in our community have built a fearsome, many times warranted, reputation. Don't complain about that negative perception of ICE, though, if you do favor their mission and chosen execution of it — because the political will behind an aggressive ICE presence in this era wants the fear. They don't want ICE to be admired, like a park ranger or a detective or a firefighter. They want ICE and the Border Patrol to strike terror into the hearts of people who've come to America for a better life but didn't follow the rules.
It's an approach that otherwise "upstanding" U.S. citizens mostly allow because of a web of racism, classism and xenophobia. It's an approach that would never, ever, ever be tolerated if deployed against mostly white Americans suspected of financial crime or illegal housing discrimination or hiring practices, for instance.
Here's how it looks in action:
— Perla Morales-Luna was walking on the sidewalk in 2018 in San Diego with her three daughter, ages 17, 15 and 12. ICE agents pulled up — as seen in disturbing video shot by one of her daughters – and ripped her away from them. They left with the woman, who came from Mexico as a teenager, and left her children standing there. Officials claimed the 36-year-old was involved in human trafficking, but a federal judge later made them release the mom pending court appearances. All the government claims of other crimes against the mother were dropped and reduced to a deportation issue for being in the country illegally.
— "Maria del Carmen Venegas was on her way to deliver a baby boy, her fifth child, by Caesarean section in a planned operation," read a Washington Post article in 2018. "Her husband, Joel Arrona-Lara, was driving her car to the hospital. Two SUVs swooped in to block the vehicle at a San Bernardino, Calif., gas station." It was ICE. He was taken away in handcuffs. She drove herself the rest of the way to the hospital and delivered their baby.
— "If you're in this country illegally, and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable, then-ICE director Thomas D. Homan told lawmakers in June 2017. "You should look over your shoulder."
— U.S. Immigration deliberate policies and willful neglect surrounding border detention since 2016 leads to credible claims of widespread sexual abuse of children and sometimes pediatric deaths related to unsanitary conditions or lack of appropriate medical care.
— A mother in Kansas City was arrested outside of her child custody hearing. "It strikes at the core of the integrity of the judiciary, the ability for people to seek out process," said her immigration attorney. (Yes, it does. And it's awful law enforcement policy and practice.)
— Respected reporting outlet ProPublica found in a major investigation about the Philadelphia area that ICE agents: "Routinely swept up immigrants they encountered by chance when they set out to arrest somebody else, with what they called 'collateral' arrests becoming the mainstay of their crackdown;" "informally expanded their definition of 'criminal alien' to include immigrants who got traffic tickets or committed minor infractions like loitering;" "revived cases that they previously disregarded, using addresses in their database to pick up immigrants they had once deemed harmless, sometimes sending carloads of armed officers to arrest them;" and "occasionally stepped over the legal line themselves, according to interviews, sworn affidavits, and court filings, by trespassing, conducting warrantless searches, engaging in racial profiling, fabricating evidence, and even soliciting a bribe."
— A lawsuit filed by the ACLU documented ways in which ICE used a cruel bait-and-switch tactic to partner with a citizenship service to snatch immigrants at visa interviews as they sought to become legal citizens.
— ICE set up a fake university to ensare students so they could be deported.
— Raids are frantic and messy. Here's the way the New York Times described one in Tennessee: "Dozens of panicked workers fled in every direction, some wedging themselves between beef carcasses or crouching under bloody butcher tables. About 100 workers, including at least one American citizen, were rounded up — every Latino employee at the plant, it turned out, save a man who had hidden in a freezer."
— Seven mayors in North Carolina recently signed a letter documenting what happens when ICE rounds up 230 people in a coordinated action. "The ICE raids have struck terror in the hearts of many of our valued community members. They have broken apart families, separating parents from their children," the letter says. "We cannot stop ICE from operating in our cities, but we can and must speak out against these raids which destabilize neighborhoods, traumatize children, hurt many innocent people, and create distrust of law enforcement. The negative collateral consequences of these raids on our cities is enormous."
— The New York State Nurses Association reported that ICE raids are making our children and our neighbors sick. "A pediatrician in North Carolina told The Atlantic magazine that she had treated young patients who were suffering from panic attacks, headaches, and other stress-related symptoms since the White House began its crackdown. Children come to school crying and asking whether their parents will be deported."
This is the backdrop that is reality in America today for so many immigrants, legal and not legal.
This is the backdrop for a decision to allow an ICE officer to come speak to middle-schoolers in Waynesboro during the school day for a career talk.
The ICE agent came last Friday morning and spoke to eighth-graders about his job. Most eighth-graders are 13 or 14 years old.
It's possible that someone in a child's extended family is in this country illegally, and that they live in fear of ICE.
As reporter Rilyn Eischens detailed this week, the ICE agent spoke as a routine professional adult, about work. But accounts of the talk indicate it might have veered toward controversial topics. Even if the talk did not, this agent had no place in our schools.
Waynesboro School District should apologize for letting an ICE agent come to school in an official capacity (to talk about his work). It's utterly inappropriate. How frightened would you be, as a 14-year-old, if a person your aunt, your older brother or your father constantly worry about ... showed up in your class? What if you were brought over the border, through no fault of your own as a child, and are attending school as an undocumented minor? You'd be shell-shocked and shaking.
And this is the rub. These feelings of fright have no place in our community schools. Children are there to learn. They need to be safe. This wasn't safe — and we're all owed an apology.
While we're at it, we should demand a return to civil society in America, where the kinds of strategic scare tactics deployed in ICE raids aren't allowed. You can start by supporting political candidates dedicated to ending this era of terror.

Texto completo: On Feb. 12, Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka "El Chapo," was convicted of multiple crimes related to running the Sinaloa drug cartel, Mexico's largest. Thirteen days before his conviction, authorities seized enough of the synthetic opioid called fentanyl for 100 million lethal doses. It was hidden in a truck carrying cucumbers through the Nogales port of legal entry. On Feb. 28, authorities at the port of Newark inspecting a container ship that had arrived from Colombia found inside a container supposedly filled with dried fruit 3,200 pounds of cocaine, worth $77 million on U.S streets. This was two days after Don Winslow published "The Border," the final volume in his 1,900-page trilogy of novels ("The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel") about the cartels and the U.S. "war on drugs." He could hardly have arranged a better launch for his book, which is already on best-seller lists.
His thesis is that the war on drugs resembles the Vietnam War in its futility and its collateral damage to Mexicans, more than 250,000 of whom have died and another 40,000 have disappeared, according to the Financial Times, in the past dozen years from violence associated with rivalrous cartels and law-enforcement measures. Those endless photos of confiscated sacks of drugs do resemble old photos of dead Vietcong - body counts of replaceable bodies. El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration - he has been in custody since 2016 - will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing?
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market - 30 million consumers of illicit drugs - must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."
The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths. Made from chemicals, not crops, and patented almost 60 years ago, it is mixed with heroin for an extra kick - and if doses are not carefully calibrated, a lethal kick. Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl - just over an ounce and a half - has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms - "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" - can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.

Red Sox seem a bit arrogant with this bullpen issue, and other thoughts

Texto completo: FORT MYERS, Fla. — Picked-up pieces from another 10 days hunkered down in the Fort:
■  The Red Sox are a wagon. They have 22 of 25 players back from a 119-win season. They have the best starting staff in baseball. They will score a ton of runs. Most of the competition in the American League stinks. The Sox are going to make the playoffs, even if everything goes wrong. They are vulnerable in only one area, and we all know what that is . . . the bullpen.
The bullpen wasn't great last season, but Craig Kimbrel was out there, and so was hot-and-cold Joe Kelly. Now both are gone and the Sox have not addressed this area.
It feels a little arrogant. It feels as if the Sox worked it out last year and feel they are smart enough to work it out again in absence of all evidence.
Please don't tell me that they fixed things in the playoffs and therefore they can fix things now. The reason they fixed things in the postseason was because they used starters Chris Sale, Rick Porcello, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi NINE times out of the bullpen in October. That is not a sustainable system for the 162-game season.
So what do you say, Dave Dombrowski?
“I think we'll be ready," answered the Sox baseball boss. “A few of the guys we haven't seen. Matt Barnes. Ryan Brasier. Heath Hembree. We haven't seen much of them. We just need to get them out there and have them ready, which we still have a couple of weeks to do.
“Any time you have unknowns . . . I still think we have ability out there. We have some guys who have been successful at the major league level. I understand there's no proven closer and until somebody gets out there and does that, there's always an uncertainty, but we think we have enough ability there to get the job done.
“We know why this gets so much attention. It's hard to say anything about our starting rotation. It's one of the best in baseball. Our positional players — we led the league in runs scored — and our defense was good and almost everybody is back.
“So the one area where there's any change is the bullpen. With rare exceptions, bullpens seem to get a lot of focus when I talk to other clubs. It's an area that is kind of up and down from year to year and gets a lot of attention in that regard. We'll be fine out there, I believe. Give the guys a chance and we'll see what takes place."
■ I'm not a fan of baseball's anything-for-a-buck partnership with big-time gambling. The DraftKings connection was bad enough, but now MLB demands that managers send in the daily lineup cards 15 minutes before it public. It's outrageous and begs for corruption. How can MLB keep punishing Pete Rose with all this going on?
■  Also not a fan of relievers being required to face at least three batters (or finish a half-inning), which will start in 2020. It's artificial and tampers with legitimate strategy.
■  Stunned by the lengths parents go to in order to get their kids to elite colleges and universities? Perfect College Match, a company that helps high school pitchers get college scholarships, reports parents scheduling unnecessary Tommy John surgery for their sons in hopes that the boys will come back throwing harder than before. Nice.
■  Quiz: Kenley Jansen will become the all-time leader in games pitched for the Dodgers when he gets into his eighth game this season. Who holds the current record? (Answer below.)
■  Theo Epstein to the New York Times: “In the second half [of 2018] we completely fell apart offensively." The Cubs boss said it probably was an anomaly, but added, “If not, then we're not who we think we are, and we'll have to make sweeping changes. We'll find out this season."
■  Aaron Judge plans to eliminate his distinctive leg kick when he has two strikes on him.
■  I believe the Red Sox would have won the 1986 World Series if Tom Seaver didn't suffer a season-ending injury in September. Seaver compiled a 3.80 ERA over 16 starts with the Sox after Lou Gorman acquired him for Steve Lyons (Cy Young for Psycho) in midsummer.
■  After Carl Yastrzemski noted that producers of the “Impossible Dream" record cut off his head in the album's cover illustration (Yaz said it was to prevent them from paying him royalties), a reader asked if the album art was conceived by the late Eddie Stanky. It was Stanky, you old-timers will recall, who foolishly called Yaz “an All-Star from the neck down" in 1967.
■  Why we will always love the New York Post: In the first days of spring training, the Post ran a piece from Tampa on Jacoby Ellsbury's latest injury. The article included a photo of Ellsbury in a batting cage with a cutline (file photo — of course!). Ellsbury, who signed a seven-year, $153 million contract in 2013, has missed 290 of a possible 810 games with the Yankees thus far. GM Brian Cashman said he expects Ellsbury in camp any day now.
■  Some of us are legitimately happy to see Alex Rodriguez engaged to Jennifer Lopez. Then there's attention-seeking Jose Canseco, who fired off a series of vile tweets charging A-Rod with cheating on J-Lo. Every outrageous Canseco missive is accompanied by a phone number in case you to want hire Jose for a boxing match or maybe a kid's birthday party.
■  The Red Sox attempted to simulate the left-field wall at Fenway when they built JetBlue Park. But Fenway South is nothing like the real thing. The wall in Fort Myers has fans seated behind netting in the upper third of the faux Monster. “I hate it," says Sox left fielder Andrew Benintendi. “They got that net right in the middle and that screws up everything. The other day there were two balls off the net, and one dropped straight down and one shot back toward right. It's not very realistic."
■  One more note on Benny. Born in Cincinnati in 1994, he has been a Bengals fan his whole life. This is not easy. “I've never seen a playoff win, not in my lifetime," says Benintendi. “Marvin Lewis had 16 years. You've got to win in the playoffs and he had seven chances at it. I still root for them even though it's tough sometimes."
■  Julia Ruth Stevens, the adopted daughter of Babe Ruth, died last week at the age of 102. She was a delight. She spent much of her life in New Hampshire and threw out a ceremonial first pitch at Fenway in July 2016 to mark her 100th birthday. When I asked her about the Curse of the Bambino back in the late 1980s, she said, “Daddy never would have done something like that." Years later, she said, “Mostly I think it's a myth, but it is a coincidence definitely that there's been many, many, many years since the Red Sox managed to win a World Series."
■  There's a sign on the Sox clubhouse wall offering car shipping for Sox players who want their spring vehicles moved to Boston after the team leaves spring training. There's a specific fee assigned to what type of vehicle the player wants shipped and it states that the car should have no gas and contain “no more than 200 pounds." When Manny Ramirez saw that sign in 2004, he asked one of the clubbies, “What about me? I weigh 205. That's more than 200 pounds." The clubbie informed Manny that he would not be inside the car during transport.
■  Check out Danny Knobler's “Unwritten: Bat Flips, the Fun Police, and Baseball's New Future." Meanwhile, Bud Selig's memoir, which had no less than three ghostwriters (including Red Sox exec Dr. Charles Steinberg), is due out this summer. Careful not to drop it on your toe.
■  Great moment at Alex Cora's postgame press conference Tuesday at JetBlue. As the manager was attempting to explain his team's six-game preseason losing streak, video of his epic 18-pitch at-bat (which culminated with a home run) magically came on the television in the interview room. Cora quickly switched the topic and narrated his epic at-bat against the White Sox in 2004. “You foul pitches off and then you hit homers," he said.
■  A national media person asked me what I think of the prospect of Epstein someday coming back to Boston to buy the Red Sox.
■  Quiz answer: Don Sutton.

El Chapo, 61, will die in a U.S. "supermax" prison, and his incarceration -- he has been in custody since 2016 -- will make no difference regarding drug flows.
The mayhem and sadism Winslow describes are, he says, derived from credible reports. Wonder what the Central Americans who trek through Mexico to the U.S. border are fleeing? Read Winslow's description of a 10-year-old Guatemalan living off a garbage dump, alert for trucks bringing garbage from the better neighborhoods.
Winslow might be right about sinister involvements of some U.S. financial institutions in handling the cartels' billions. He could, however, have omitted the thinly -- very thinly -- disguised President Donald Trump, and his son-in-law who knowingly uses cartel money to rescue himself from a bad Manhattan real estate bet. One reason to read fiction is to avoid reading about those people. However, the upward of $40 billion in profits made from the $150 billion U.S. market -- 30 million consumers of illicit drugs -- must go somewhere. First, to Mexico, "so much cash," Winslow says, "they don't even count it, they weigh it." But then where?
Every day 4,500 trucks pass, necessarily with usually minimal inspection, through three legal entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border. Any wall would be irrelevant to interrupting drug shipments. As is the strategy of bringing down cartel kingpins. The New York Times reports that in 2016 and 2017, when El Chapo was in custody, "Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled."
The "supply side" attack on drugs is frustrated by, among other things, geography and the torrent of south-north commerce. The "demand side" is frustrated by declining prices (the supply-side failure) for increasingly potent products, such as fentanyl, which has passed prescription opioids and heroin in overdose deaths.

Says New York University's Mark A.R. Kleiman: In 1979, a milligram of pure heroin sold for about $9 in today's prices; today it costs less than 25 cents. "Fifty grams of fentanyl -- just over an ounce and a half -- has the punch of a kilogram of heroin, and it's way, way cheaper." Three hundred micrograms -- "roughly the weight of a grain of table salt" -- can kill. And dealers are not precise chemists.
"We have," Kleiman says, "about 30 times as many drug dealers behind bars today as we had in 1980" but today's dealers employ cellphones, texting, social media and home delivery. In the most recent Global Drug Survey, Kleiman says, "cocaine users around the world reported that their most recent cocaine order was delivered in less time, on average, than their most recent pizza order."
He notes that serious cultural change has taken 50 years regarding tobacco, yet it is "still much more widely used than any of the illicit drugs except for cannabis." And "the fentanyls aren't going to be the last class of purely synthetic and super-potent recreational chemicals; they're just the first." Worse living through chemistry, even if it disadvantages the crop-growing cartels of Winslow's epic.

GREYHOUND ALTERS POLICY FOR IMMIGRANTS

Texto completo: PHOENIX - Greyhound Lines Inc. is no longer allowing U.S. authorities to drop off immigrant families inside bus stations, forcing those who have been released from custody to wait outside until they have a ticket.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that it had been asked to drop off migrants outside facilities instead of busing them in.
ICE for years has dropped off migrants at Greyhound stations, largely in Phoenix, after releasing them pending court hearings to decide whether they can stay in the country. From the stations, they travel to their intended destination in the United States.
Greyhound spokeswoman Crystal Booker said the Dallas-based company is experiencing an "unprecedented increase of individuals" at certain bus terminals and that travelers need tickets to get in. She said the policy applies to anyone who lacks a ticket.
"Our priority is to safely and efficiently get customers to their destinations," Ms. Booker said in a statement.
Immigrants who are released by ICE don't usually have prior notice and can't make travel arrangements until they arrive at the station. Most of them don't have money and have to wait on a relative or advocacy group to buy their ticket.
Crash investigation
HEJERE, Ethiopia - Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down and appeared to gain startling speed.
President Donald Trump, in a phone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, praised the state-owned airline "as a strong institution" and affirmed U.S. support after Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people, Mr. Abiy's office said. The two shared condolences in a rare public outreach by Mr. Trump to an African leader.
Forensic DNA work began in identifying remains, and Muslim families held prayers for the dead, anxious to have something to bury as soon as possible. The dead came from 35 countries.
Venezuela flights halted
FORT WORTH, Texas - American Airlines is stopping flights to Venezuela because of safety concerns after the pilots' union told its members to refuse to work the flights.
American was the last major U.S. carrier to fly to the troubled country. It flew daily to Caracas and Maracaibo from Miami.
The airline said Friday that it temporarily stopped the flights as it evaluated conditions in Venezuela, where civil unrest has increased amid opposition to President Nicolas Maduro.
"American will not operate to countries we don't consider safe," said spokesman Ross Feinstein.
The airline's decision followed a union president's order Thursday night that American Airlines pilots refuse Venezuela assignments.
Daniel Carey of the Allied Pilots Association noted that the State Department issued a warning about crime and detention of American citizens in Venezuela. The U.S. pulled its last diplomats out of the country Thursday.
Mr. Carey closed his memo by writing, "To reiterate: Do not accept any trips to Venezuela."

Texto completo: Fifty people were charged this week with taking part in a nationwide scheme to game the process of admission to highly competitive schools. While federal authorities say that this is the largest prosecution of its kind in history, it is far from the first.
Here's a look back at five other times manipulation of the admissions process caused a scandal:
The Time-Zone Quirk
It was an ingenious and audacious idea: pay expert test takers to memorize answers in New York and then phone them to Los Angeles and Chicago, where the tests had not been taken yet. The answers were then carved in code on the sides of pencils being used to take the same tests, the Graduate Management Admission Test, the Graduate Record Exam, and the Test of English as a Foreign Language.
Between 1992 and 1996, several hundred people took advantage of the time differences, paying between $2,000 and $9,000, depending on how high the desired score was. The students were flown or driven to test centers, where they were given pencils with the coded answers. Hundreds of students received high scores and were admitted to graduate schools around the country, prosecutors said.
The mastermind of the scheme, Po Chieng Ma, was sentenced in 1998 to four years in prison.
Columbia University, New York University, Fordham University and Hunter College, all in New York, were among the schools receiving fraudulent scores, the indictment said.
"This obsession with test scores, as indicated by this case, underscores the importance of getting a fuller picture of candidates than can be gleaned from just looking at standardized tests," said George E. Rupp, the president of Columbia at the time.
Paying Someone Else to Take the Test
Twenty students were arrested on Long Island in 2011 for accepting payment or paying others to take the SAT and ACT between 2008-11.
Administrators at Great Neck North High School began an inquiry after a student confided to a college counselor that someone was accepting money to take the SAT for other students. They decided to focus on students who had registered to take the tests outside the district and also compared SAT scores with student grade-point averages.
Some of the widest discrepancies were with students who chose to take the test off-site, where they would not be recognized. The test takers used fake identification cards.
The group of 20 were from five schools: Five of them were suspected of taking tests for others and the other 15 were accused of paying them $500 to $3,600 to take the tests. Students who signed up could pay in installments. One of the test takers was Samuel Eshaghoff, a graduate of Great Neck North, who even took tests for girls.
"I thought that there was an easy way to make money," he said later on "60 Minutes." "And just like any other easy way to make money, it's always too good to be true."
The scheme prompted a requirement that students provide a photograph when they sign up for college entrance exams, and that officials check those images against the test takers' ID.
Fairy-Tale Applications
T.M. Landry, a small school in small-town Louisiana, had gained national attention for sending its underprivileged black students to elite colleges, including Yale, Brown, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell and Wesleyan. It produced its first graduating class in 2013.
But The New York Times reported last year that the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and trafficked in the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture Cinderella stories.
The Landrys, the husband-and-wife team that led the school, were also accused of physical and emotional abuse by students and teachers. One student interviewed said that he did not know that the school had lied on his behalf, while others were told to lie on their applications.
While some Landry graduates were successful, others had to withdraw from college, or transfer to less rigorous programs because of a lack of preparation.
The Landrys denied fabricating student stories, and the school is still operating.
Special Consideration for the Politically Connected
While it is no surprise that admissions offices have ways for top administrators and prominent alumni to signal their interest in applicants, a Chicago Tribune investigation in 2009 revealed a "clout list" of those who got special consideration because of political connections.
The scheme was known internally as Category I, and The Tribune said that 800 applicants won spots at the flagship Urbana-Champaign campus after intervention from state lawmakers and university trustees. The newspaper said the students were admitted even though some did not meet the university's admission standards.
A state commission's inquiry concluded that Category I was a sophisticated shadow admissions process for applicants who were supported by politicians, donors and other prominent sponsors.
According to internal documents and email messages released to the panel, university officials fretted about the university's decline in national rankings as a result of admitting unqualified students, even as they encouraged the special treatment.
The university's president and the chancellor of the flagship campus, as well as a majority of the members of the university's board, resigned after the commission's report.
A Front-Page Answer Key
On the day in June 1989 that 80,000 high school students in New York were to take a state-administered chemistry exam, The New York Post published the answers to the stolen test on its front page.
The Post said that it published the answer key to the multiple-choice test after learning that thousands of photocopies of the answers had been illegally sold to students in New York City.
The test is one of the many state-sponsored Regents examinations, whose results are a factor in course grades and college admissions.
State education officials said that the answer sheet on the front page appeared to have been sent by fax in the morning to students in upstate New York.
In addition to chemistry, other stolen tests included those for United States history, global studies and 10th-grade mathematics. It was only the second time in the 111-year history of the Regents that an exam had been canceled, The Times reported.
The Post's editor at the time, Jerry Nachman, said that the front page showed the pervasive corruption surrounding the test. "These weren't the Pentagon papers," he said of the 56-question answer key. "What made the story was not the uniqueness of the documents, but their omnipresence."
Photograph Columbia was victim of a scheme in which East Coast test takers fed answers to those in later time zones. B. Joseph White resigned as president of the University of Illinois when it was found to have given preference to children of wealthy people.

Conservative lawyers steal page from progressive playbook

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.

She Invented A Game With Scientific Integrity, And It’s Taking Off

Texto completo: COLLEGE PARK, Md. - The roseate spoonbill is roughly the size of a great blue heron, with the pink plumage of a flamingo and a giant spoon-shaped bill - “gorgeous at a distance and bizarre up close,” according to the Audubon Guide to North American birds. It is Elizabeth Hargrave’s favorite bird.
“Crazy bills get me,” she said on a recent sunny Saturday. Hargrave, a health-policy consultant in Silver Spring, Maryland, is an avid birder, and her favorite local winter birding spot is the Lake Artemesia Natural Area. Fringed with woods, the lake is artificial, excavated during the construction of Washington’s Green Line in the 1970s; in those days, the area was known as Lake Metro.
Setting out on a trail around the lake, bird guide close at hand, Hargrave had barely set up her scope when she spotted another species of her beloved crazy-billed birds: “Oh, fun!” She had caught two northern shovelers, their beaks submerged, trawling for invertebrates. “There are diving ducks and dabbling ducks,” she said. “The northern shovelers are dabblers.”
Hargrave is more diver than dabbler. A spreadsheet geek with a master’s degree in public affairs, she spent more than a decade as a policy analyst with NORC at the University of Chicago. There, she studied, among other things, prescription drug trends for the report to Congress by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. She is now self-employed.
“I came for the social policy, wanting to help people,” she said. “But then, working in the field, I realized how much I also enjoy the crunchy analytics.”
And in her spare time, she has been crossbreeding her analytics skills and her birding hobby to hatch something new: a board game, her first ever, about ... birds. In Wingspan, published last week by Stonemaier Games, players assign birds with various powers - represented by 170 illustrated cards, hand-drawn by two artists, Natalia Rojas and Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo - to wetland, grassland and forest habitats.
Aiming to design a game with scientific integrity, Hargrave pulled data on North American birds from eBird, a citizen-science project managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. She also made use of the lab’s All About Birds website, as well as Audubon’s online guide.
Then she built a spreadsheet. At its most extreme, it ran 596 rows by nearly 100 columns - sorting, for instance, by order, class, genus, habitat, wingspan, nest type, eggs, food and red-list status. (Endangered birds confer special powers.)
Within the spreadsheet tool, Hargrave embedded formulas calibrating the score for each bird as the sum of various assets, such as the value of its eggs. What hooked Jamey Stegmaier, president of Stonemaier Games, was Hargrave’s wonkish ability to strike a fine balance, using so many cards, between the two driving components of game design: mathematics and psychology, with the latter taking precedence. “The key for me wasn’t the birds, but the satisfying feeling of collecting beautiful things,” he said.
Hargrave also has a card game, Tussie Mussie, about the Victorian language of flowers, debuting in May, and a game about monarch butterflies, with the working title Mariposas, due for release next year. She is among the few women in game design - which was something she planned to research, until last December, when she noticed a newly published study exploring exactly that: “Assessing Gender and Racial Representation in the Board Game Industry.”
During the hundreds of Wingspan play tests, some gamers scratched their heads and said, “Birds? Really!?” They expressed concern that our feathered friends might not resonate with a community usually drawn to zombies, dragons, spaceships, farming, civilizations and trains.
But during the preorder period in January, more than 5,000 games sold in a week; the game is now on its third print run, with a total of 30,000 games in English, and 14,000 in various foreign-language editions. On official release day, demand so exceeded supply that the publisher issued a public apology. Between birders and gamers, and the birder-gamer hybrid, Wingspan has found its followers - especially, naturally, on Twitter.
Hargrave’s home habitat, which she shares with her landscape-designer husband, Matt Cohen, is its own nature reserve, with vegetables in the backyard and a row of blueberry bushes out front. Inside, her watercolor paintings, of mushrooms and wildflowers, hang on the walls, complemented here and there with shells, snake skins and animal skulls.
The idea for Wingspan came to her after a game night with friends. They got talking about why there weren’t any board games tied to subjects they found interesting. Hargrave loves the game Castles of Burgundy, but pretending to be an aristocrat in high medieval France isn’t exactly her thing. She wondered, “Wouldn’t it be great if we had Race for the Galaxy” - another game that often hits her table, about building galactic civilizations - “but with birds?”
Wingspan bills itself as a card-driven, engine-building board game: Players start with limited strength and slowly assemble their gameplay mechanism, which becomes more powerful with each turn. A classic example is Monopoly, in which players accrete real-estate empires, although hobby gamers would point to more sophisticated examples, such as Terraforming Mars.
In Wingspan, the assets from which players reap points are the birds, their eggs and their food sources. Each player assumes the role of a birder, collecting birds and deciding which to deploy on the board and cultivate.
For instance, the roseate spoonbill is worth six points at the end of the game. Once it is placed in the wetland habitat (at the food cost of one invertebrate, one seed and one fish), it can lay two eggs, which also generate points. And as its special power, it allows the player to draw two new bonus cards and keep one.
“The beginning of the game design process is about finding the fun,” said Matthew O’Malley, a game designer and one of Hargrave’s perpetual play testers. “The focus is on creating interesting decisions.” At each turn, do you want to play a bird, or gain food, or lay an egg or draw a new card?
“Later you focus on the mathematics of things, making sure that everything is balanced, and that players feel everything is fair,” he said. Where Wingspan really succeeds, he added, is in giving players lots of agency. It offers numerous paths to victory (the Holy Grail in game design) without inducing “analysis paralysis.”

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee will regret its decision to bar Fox News from hosting any of its 2020 presidential primary debates. Just as the game begins, the committee has planted the idea that the Democrats mean to run a rigged election -- not a happy thought to encourage in view of the way the party's leaders fiddled with the process in 2016 to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.
The Democrats consider Fox a propaganda arm of the Trump administration, but they have their own propaganda arms. Most of the mainstream media manifest a deep affinity for progressive Democrats and their agenda. To exclude Fox smacks of Soviet one-party theatrics.
The journalists at CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post and the New York Times and, broadly speaking, the elected officials and paid operatives of the Democratic Party -- almostall of these people agree on the issues of the day: women's rights,abortion, gay marriage and other LGBTQ issues, Black Lives Matter, gun control, immigration, the border wall, family separation at the U.S.-Mexican border, Russian collusion, Brett Kavanaugh's fitness and so on. They agree, above all, in opposing and loathing Donald Trump.
MSNBC's "Morning Joe" unfolds each weekday morning as a relentless, ritualized denunciation of Mr. Trump and all his works. With almost hilarious single-mindedness, the program's repertory company addresses itself to the work of discrediting and -- they hope -- one day ousting the president.
It will be fatal to Democrats' chances in 2020 to encourage the suspicion they won't tolerate points of view that differ from progressive orthodoxy. Unbiased viewers know that Fox employs many credible journalists: Bret Baier, Martha McCallum and Chris Wallace, for example.
Anyway, Fox journalists asking the questions would only sharpen the debate and increase the candidates' credibility. The ideologues at the DNC don't grasp the virtue of competing ideas. Jacobins rarely do.
True, Sean Hannity whispers in Mr. Trump's ear. That is probably a bad idea, but it has abundant historical precedent. The muckraking journalistLincoln Steffens of McClure's Magazine, author of "The Shame of the Cities,"met often with President Theodore Rooseveltto advisehim on progressive policy.
Arthur Krock, Washington bureau chief and a columnist for the New York Times, was in the Kennedy family's pocket for years. He wrote columns in the late 1930s pushing Joseph P. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's father, for president. The journalist had the sense to turn down the patriarch's offer of a car one Christmas, considering the bribe too blatant. Krock used his influence on the Pulitzer board to engineer a 1957 prize for JFK's "Profiles in Courage."
Henry Luce, co-founder and editor in chief of Time Inc., regarded his magazines as the voices of the American superego. He liked to tellhis countrymenwhat to think, and presidents how to act. Presidents feared Luce and his ability to teach and preach to tens of millions of American voters every week. Luce had an especially proprietary sense of President Dwight Eisenhower, whom his magazines backed in 1952. Intellectuals damned Luce and envied him his vast readershipand almost unique influence upon the American popular mind. Phil Graham, publisher of the Washington Post, was an intimate adviser to Lyndon Johnson, notably at the 1960 Democratic convention, where LBJ sought the top spot on the ticket but settled for the second.
President Kennedy and Ben Bradlee, of Newsweek and later of the Washington Post, had a glamorous friendship that was close and, from a journalistic point of view, notquite ethical.
The DNC made a bad move. One or two of the declared Democratic candidates might distinguish themselvesnowby demandingthatthe committee reverse itself and invite Fox News -- and its audience -- back into the American electoral process.

Texto completo: If you're feeling a sense of déjà vu because the title and cover of this book seem familiar, that might be because just a few weeks ago I wrote a review about another of Rachel Hollis' books: "Girl, Wash Your Face." Well, she's back and better than ever in her new book, "Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals."
Hollis is a successful businesswoman, CCO of The Hollis Co., a motivational speaker and podcast host who has cultivated a massive online following. She's also married, with four kids. And now she's a New York Times best-selling author.
"Girl, Stop Apologizing" is all about YOU and your dreams and goals and how to achieve them. She separates the book into three parts.
Part one is all about excuses that you make to do or not to do something and why and how to let go of those excuses. She gives personal examples from her life and gives great advice.
Part two is all about the different behaviors that you should adopt, including establishing a morning routine (or just a routine in general) and asking for help.
Part three is all about the different skills that you should acquire, such as planning and persistence.
Hollis gives helpful advice on how to achieve your goals. Right off the bat, in the introduction, she addresses the ever-present "what if" questions. After the introduction, she goes on to destroy all the excuses that you make in an attempt to save yourself from failure.
She points out, in a not-so-subtle way, that we make excuse after excuse to NOT try to achieve a goal or dream, then she immediately smashes that excuse to smithereens. Throughout the rest of the book, she goes into greater detail on how to move forward and start to work toward your dream or goal.
This is a great book for any girl or woman who has dreams and goals, but maybe not the courage to go after them. She inspires, gives you a helpful push and offers great advice for putting these dreams and goals into action.
Maybe you want to run a marathon, or maybe you just want to read more. No matter what, you have to start somewhere. So if you're not quite ready to embark on the great adventure, I highly recommend this book. Because after reading it, you will surely feel energized and excited to give it your best shot.
If you've already read "Girl, Stop Apologizing," here are a few related titles:
* "Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies about Who You Are So You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be" by Hollis.
* "Chasing Slow: Courage to Journey Off the Beaten Path" by Erin Loechner.
* "If You Only Knew: My Unlikely, Unavoidable Story of Becoming Free" by Jamie Ivey.
* "Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals" by Rachel Hollis was published by HarperCollins Leadership this year. It retails for $24.99.
* Emma Allen works for Inklings Bookshop. She and other Inklings staffers review books in this space every week.

Texto completo: Francesco “Franky Boy” Cali, the leader of the Gambino crime family, was slain Wednesday outside his Staten Island home after being shot, and became the first mob boss to be killed in New York City in more than 30 years.

Cali, 53, was shot six times while his wife and children were inside their home around 9:20 p.m., police sources told the New York Times and the New York Post.

“I just heard the pow-pow-pow-pow-pow,” a neighbor who identified himself as Salvatore told the Times.

The New York Daily News reports a family member called 911 and claimed that a blue pickup truck struck the mob leader before he was shot. Investigators are still examining whether Cali was harmed by the truck, and are trying to track down the blue pickup truck.

“There were like six shots, and then there were three more,” a witness told the Daily News. “The man was on the ground face-up. His head was by his SUV, and the truck was open.”

Police claimed Thursday no arrests have been made and they are analyzing video footage of the incident.

Cali, who was originally from Sicily, was declared dead at Staten Island University Hospital North.

The last time a crime family boss was shot in New York was 1985, when Paul Castellano of the Gambino family was outside Manhattan’s Sparks Steak House.

Castellano’s death was arranged by John Gotti, who took control of the family afterwards and was known for dining at expensive restaurants as he was accompanied by bodyguards.

Gotti and multiple leaders of the Gambino family were convicted in the 1990s for crimes such as murder and racketeering, but Cali only pleaded guilty to conspiring to extort money in 2008 as part of an unsuccessful effort to construct a NASCAR track on Staten Island. He served 16 months behind bars for his only mob-related criminal conviction.

The Daily News and other local media outlets report Cali became the leader of the Gambino crime family, one of the “Five Families” that monopolize organized crime in New York City, in 2015 and succeeded Domenico Cefalu once Cefalu stepped down.

Shocked by Biased Journalism? Please. Democrats make a mistake in trying to freeze out Fox News.

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee will regret its decision to bar Fox News from hosting any of its 2020 presidential primary debates. Just as the game begins, the committee has planted the idea that the Democrats mean to run a rigged election—not a happy thought to encourage in view of the way the party's leaders fiddled with the process in 2016 to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.
The Democrats consider Fox a propaganda arm of the Trump administration, but they have their own propaganda arms. Most of the mainstream media manifest a deep affinity for progressive Democrats and their agenda. To exclude Fox smacks of Soviet one-party theatrics.
The journalists at CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post and the New York Times and, broadly speaking, the elected officials and paid operatives of the Democratic Party—almost all of these people agree on the issues of the day: women's rights, abortion, gay marriage and other LGBTQ issues, Black Lives Matter, gun control, immigration, the border wall, family separation at the U.S.-Mexican border, Russian collusion, Brett Kavanaugh's fitness and so on. They agree, above all, in opposing and loathing Donald Trump.
MSNBC's "Morning Joe" unfolds each weekday morning as a relentless, ritualized denunciation of Mr. Trump and all his works. With almost hilarious single-mindedness, the program's repertory company addresses itself to the work of discrediting and—they hope—one day ousting the president.
It will be fatal to Democrats' chances in 2020 to encourage the suspicion they won't tolerate points of view that differ from progressive orthodoxy. Unbiased viewers know that Fox employs many credible journalists: Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum and Chris Wallace, for example.
Anyway, Fox journalists asking the questions would only sharpen the debate and increase the candidates' credibility. The ideologues at the DNC don't grasp the virtue of competing ideas. Jacobins rarely do.
True, Sean Hannity whispers in Mr. Trump's ear. That is probably a bad idea, but it has abundant historical precedent. The muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens of McClure's Magazine, author of "The Shame of the Cities," met often with President Theodore Roosevelt to advise him on progressive policy.
Arthur Krock, Washington bureau chief and a columnist for the New York Times, was in the Kennedy family's pocket for years. He wrote columns in the late 1930s pushing Joseph P. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's father, for president. The journalist had the sense to turn down the patriarch's offer of a car one Christmas, considering the bribe too blatant. Krock used his influence on the Pulitzer board to engineer a 1957 prize for JFK's "Profiles in Courage."
Henry Luce, co-founder and editor in chief of Time Inc., regarded his magazines as the voices of the American superego. He liked to tell his countrymen what to think, and presidents how to act. Presidents feared Luce and his ability to teach and preach to tens of millions of American voters every week. Luce had an especially proprietary sense of President Dwight Eisenhower, whom his magazines backed in 1952. Intellectuals damned Luce and envied him his vast readership and almost unique influence upon the American popular mind. Phil Graham, publisher of the Washington Post, was an intimate adviser to Lyndon Johnson, notably at the 1960 Democratic convention, where LBJ sought the top spot on the ticket but settled for the second.
President Kennedy and Ben Bradlee, of Newsweek and later of the Washington Post, had a glamorous friendship that was close and, from a journalistic point of view, not quite ethical.
The DNC made a bad move. One or two of the declared Democratic candidates might distinguish themselves now by demanding that the committee reverse itself and invite Fox News—and its audience—back into the American electoral process.

1 kid can end vaccination debate

Texto completo: The state of Arizona reported its first case of measles on Friday with just enough detail to tell us why we cannot let our guard down on infectious disease.
It's not because one case of measles should alarm us. It shouldn't.
It's not because we'll see an outbreak. It's too early to know that.
It's because even the sparse facts of this particular case help us see our future.
As is common with measles, the first confirmed Arizona patient is an infant, a 12-month-old who had not been vaccinated. The child recently traveled to and from Asia and developed symptoms of the disease.
We live in a nation and a world that grows more international by the day.
Air travel is far more common than it was a quarter-century ago, and the United States is far more diverse. Those are trend lines expected to surge upward.
In 2016 there were 3.8 billion air travelers in the world, reports the International Air Transport Association. By 2035 that number is projected to grow to 7.2 billion.
More travel, means more trips abroad, and more trips abroad mean more contact with countries in which certain infectious diseases, such as measles, are more common.
"Most of the American cases since 2000 have been the result of people traveling to or from countries where measles is endemic because there is little vaccination," reports The New York Times.
No doubt we'll eventually see countervailing measures as the developing world embraces greater immunization.
But until then our defenses must stand ready.
There was a time when lax laws in Arizona and more than a dozen other states could accommodate the eccentricities of anti-vaxxers and the uncommon religious beliefs of certain parents. We never needed full compliance to protect the herd. With 93-95 percent of people vaccinated, you could still prevent outbreaks.
But eccentricity has turned to fad, and a movement of anti-vaxxers has grown more adroit at recruiting numbers in their communities and in the Legislature.
Republicans at the Arizona Capitol ran three bills through the House Health and Human Services Committee on party-line votes that would assist parents who want to exempt their public-school children from immunization.
In other words, Arizona is moving in exactly the wrong direction that our changing world requires.
One bill would nix the requirement for parents to sign a state health form for exemption. Another would inun-date parents with detailed information on vaccine ingredients and risk. That sounds good, but public health officials warn that the flood of information without context could overwhelm parents and prompt them to skip vaccinations.
A third bill would require doctors to offer school students testing that can determine if they can bypass vaccines. That testing is expensive and unreliable, warn state public health officials.
Leading the charge for opt-outs are Republican lawmakers Nancy Barto and Kelly Townsend, who argue the state should not coerce parents into vaccinating their kids. Townsend compared vaccination requirements to communism and forced tattoos.
Here's where she is wrong.
There are enormous advantages to living in populated places. We don't think about this much because it's second nature to us. Cities allow us to share information and ideas, collaborate on business, exchange goods and services, attend advanced centers of learning and access cutting-edge health care.
With civilization and urbanization comes responsibility. We cannot enjoy the benefits of the city and behave in ways that harm others. This means none of us enjoys the freedom to drive 120 mph on our roads and freeways. If that's coercion, we are similarly coerced to obtain a driver's license to use the roads, endure security checks to fly on airplanes, undergo background checks to purchase firearms.
If Barto and Townsend don't like such mandates, they should start by burning their driver's licenses.
Just like Arizona, California once liberally accommodated anti-vaxxers with opt-out laws. Then a sick child spread infection through Disneyland in late 2014 and 147 people, mostly children, contracted measles.
By 2016 the state had passed a new law requiring just about all public and private school students to get vaccinated against contagious diseases.
In 2018, a California appellate court upheld the law. Of the vaccine opponents who sued the state, Associate Justice Ronald Robie wrote, "Plaintiffs' arguments are strong on hyperbole and scant on authority."
Washington state finally got hard-nosed with anti-vaxxers when a measles outbreak in southwest Washington late last year sickened 71 people, mostly children 10 and under. Some 800 exposed kids were held out of school.
Now Republican state lawmaker Paul Harris is spearheading efforts to limit exemptions to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the Seattle Times reports.
If Arizona relaxes its laws, and the anti-vaxxer movement continues to grow its ranks, we may witness our own serious outbreak.
If that happens, the party is over. No more opt-outs. No more bowing to the anti-vaxx crusade.
Arizona will enact its own tough laws.
Until then, a sick child in Pima County warns that our world is getting smaller and we had better get ready.

Texto completo: Sam Graham-Felsen, author of the award-winning novel Green, will visit Centenary's Meadows Museum of Art on Monday, March 18 for a book reading. The 6:30 p.m. event is free and open to the public. In addition to reading from his novel, Graham-Felsen will answer questions from audience members about writing and storytelling more broadly.
Graham-Felsen published Green in January 2018 and the coming-of-age novel attracted immediate attention, receiving the American Library Association's Alex Award, being selected as a New York Times Editor's Pick, and appearing in The New Yorker's list of "Books We Loved in 2018." Green tackles themes of race, privilege, and the struggle for the elusive American dream with what a Boston Globe review described as, "A riot of language that's part hip-hop, part nerd boy, and part pure imagination."
Graham-Felsen was the chief blogger for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and has published nonfiction work in The New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post, and The Nation, among others.
"Sam Graham-Felsen is a versatile writer who has made a national name for himself in both nonfiction and fiction, and has a fascinating story to tell about how aspiring young writers can use the written word across a range of professional settings, from political campaigns and advocacy work, to investigative reporting and journalism, to the literary arts," says Dr. Emily Leithauser, assistant professor of English at Centenary. "He has written a timely novel that raises important questions about how race and privilege intersect in our culture today."
Students in several English classes will also have the chance to interact with Graham-Felsen while he is on campus.
For more information about Graham-Felsen's Meadows Museum event, contact Emily Leithauser at eleithauser@centenary.edu.

Texto completo: “The Humans,” which won the Tony for best play in 2016 and is opening tonight at Ephrata Performing Arts Center, is a family drama.
But it is not a melodrama. People will not be admitting to lurid affairs, incest or deep betrayals.
But don’t think drama doesn’t take place around Brigid Blake’s table, for it certainly does. Her family is coming for Thanksgiving dinner. When is there not a little drama around the Thanksgiving table?
Brigid (Julia Elberfeld) and boyfriend Rich (Brian Viera) are hosting their first Thanksgiving dinner in their new apartment in New York’s Chinatown.
Her parents, Erik and Deirdre Blake (Tim Spiese and Elizabeth Pattey), are coming from Scranton with Momo, Erik’s mother (Kath Goodwin), and sister Aimee (Megan Riggs), is coming from Philadelphia, where she is a lawyer.
The play, which is directed by Bob Breen, is set in real time and runs for about an hour and a half, so the Thanksgiving action is a bit accelerated.
“Brigid is having a great big show. She wants to show off her new apartment and her new boyfriend,” Eberfeld says.
Of course, things don’t go well.
We will recognize the conversation, as people talk over people and people cut off other people.
The kids make fun of their mother’s Catholic beliefs — she likes to bring Virgin Mary statues as housewarming gifts.
It isn’t malicious; it’s daughters having different ideas than their mother.
“It’s how people talk, how they act,” Pattey says.
“It’s naturalistic to a T,” Riggs says.
“At the same time, there’s not a wasted word in this play,” Spiese says. “The more I work with it, the more I like it.”
We discover early on that Aimee and Erik were at the World Trade Center on 9/11. He was accompanying her to a job interview, and it took them hours to find each other.
“He’s having trouble dealing with that, though he keeps saying he’s OK. But he’s not OK,” Spiese says.
The play is not really about 9/11, which is a number of years in the past.
“But 9/11 is what set the boulder rolling in this family,” Riggs says.
“It frames what the fear is,” Spiese says. “There are a lot of laughs in this play, but there is a lot of dark, serious stuff. Still, you’re laughing.”
There is plenty of fear in the Blake family.
Erik Blake is a working-class guy. He’s in charge of maintenance at a private school. Deirdre has been an office manager for two years. For a long time, they led a comfortable enough middle-class existence.
But now, money is an issue, as it is with way too many middle-class people these days. Fear, insecurity and uncertainty about the future flow through everyone’s veins.
Erik’s mother is in a wheelchair and has dementia, but they can’t afford help to care for her.
Aimee worries about losing her job.
They are not here to destroy each other.
“You can tell they all love each other,” Riggs says.
“It’s, ‘I love you but I don’t have to like you right now,” Elberfeld says.
“Everyone is worried about everything,” Pattey says.
Erik believed in the American dream. Now, he’s not sure.
“I thought I’d be settled now,” Spiese says.
Brigid is working as a bartender and drowning in college debt.
Ed Fernandez, the artistic director of Ephrata Performing Arts Center, notes that the play affects people differently, depending on where they are in their lives.
“What (playwright) Steve Karam has done so beautifully is have a show that speaks individually to everyone,” Riggs says.
The play is naturalistic in more ways than one. The cast must eat an entire Thanksgiving meal through the run of the show.
“It’s hard,” Elberfeld says. “You have to think, if I put this in my mouth will I be able to say the line I need to say. There is chew choreography here.”
Charles Isherwood, of the New York Times, called “The Humans” “blisteringly funny, bruisingly sad and altogether wonderful.”

How to find out if your flight is a grounded Boeing Max 8 or 9 airplane

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: La nueva fiscal general estatal de Nueva York, Letitia James, envió citaciones a Deutsche Bank e Investors Bank el lunes por los registros que involucraban la fallida oferta del mandatario Donald Trump para comprar el equipo de fútbol americano “Buffalo Bills” y otros negocios relacionados con la Organización Trump.
Un día después de emitir las citaciones, James pidió a los legisladores en Albany cerrar la “laguna” legal que prohíbe a los fiscales del estado presentar cargos similares contra personas indultadas por cargos federales.
“Tenemos un acuerdo en ambas casas, anticipamos que el proyecto de ley se aprobará en un par de semanas”, dijo a New York Post.
La citación del Deutsche Bank investiga solicitudes de préstamos, hipotecas, líneas de crédito y otros registros de transacciones financieras relacionadas con el Trump International Hotel en Washington, el Trump National Doral en el sur de Florida y el Trump International Hotel and Tower en Chicago , informó The New York Times.
Se le pidió a Investors Bank, con sede en Nueva Jersey, registros relacionados con Trump Park Avenue.
James también ha solicitado registros vinculados por los intentos de Trump de comprar los “Buffalo Bills” en 2014. El acuerdo se vino abajo después de que Terry Pegula, propietario del equipo de hockey Buffalo Sabres, compró el equipo de la NFL por $1,400 millones de dólares.
James, quien prometió en su campaña investigar al presidente, inició el proceso civil luego de que Michael Cohen, antiguo abogado de Trump, testificara ante un panel del Congreso el 27 de febrero.
En el Congreso se están realizando varias investigaciones sobre Trump, sus negocios y su campaña, y por el asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Deutsche Bank confirmó a The New York Times que había recibido la citación, pero Investors Bank se negó a comentar. La Organización Trump no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del periódico.
En febrero, una coalición de 16 fiscales generales, incluyendo a James por NY, presentó una demanda contra Trump, en un intento por frenar la “emergencia nacional” con la que el mandatario busca recaudar fondos para construir el muro en la frontera con México.

Texto completo: Thomas Heard, residente de El Bronx que se identifica como una afroamericana transgénero llamada Tasha, fue detenida el sábado por la policía, como sospechosa por ataques graves de odio contra personas blancas en Nueva York.
Cuatro de los ataques tuvieron lugar en Harlem y el Upper West Side, informó The New York Times. Dos de ellos ocurrieron en estaciones del Metro.
Ninguna de las víctimas resultó gravemente herida, pero igual se consideran “delitos graves”.
El arresto de Heard se produce en medio de un aumento en los delitos de odio denunciados en toda la ciudad, que subieron 5% en 2018 en comparación con 2017, mayormente contra personas de raza negra y judías. Esa tendencia alcista ha continuado en los dos primeros meses del año 2019.
Heard ha sido arrestada más de 60 veces desde 2002 por cargos que incluyen prostitución, conducta sexual inapropiada y desorden , dijo la policía. Fue procesada el domingo y retenida con una fianza de $30 mil dólares.
El primer ataque tuvo lugar el viernes a las 2 p.m. cuando un hombre blanco de 55 años que caminaba con su esposa por una concurrida sección comercial de East 187th Street fue insultado por Heard. Gritó su odio a los caucásicos y luego roció al hombre en la cara con gas pimienta, dijo la policía.
El sábado, Heard abordó a un hombre y una mujer a las 4:30 p.m. mientras caminaban juntos cerca de la esquina de Crotona Avenue y East 187th Street. Le preguntó a la mujer si era blanca y luego la roció con aerosol pimienta, mientras blandía un “objeto afilado” como arma.
NYPD también le dijo a NBC News que cinco personas fueron atacadas el viernes con aerosol en una parada del Metro en Harlem (125th St) y otra en una estación del Upper West Side.

Texto completo: Before he was murdered inside a Saudi Consulate in October, our colleague Jamal Khashoggi questioned why Saudi Arabia had detained a prominent doctor, Walid Fitaihi, a dual Saudi-U.S. citizen seized in a November 2017 roundup of businessmen. The detainees, in what was described as an anti-corruption drive, were held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh.
"What happened to us?" Khashoggi, himself a Saudi, asked on Twitter. "How can a person like @Walidfitaihi get arrested, and for what reason?" He added, "With no interceding channels to pursue & no Attorney General to answer questions & verify charges, of course everyone is struck with awe and helplessness."
Today, Khashoggi is no longer able to ask such impertinent questions. He was assassinated in Istanbul by a hit squad that intelligence reports say was dispatched by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But Khashoggi's question remains relevant.
Fitaihi, founder of a medical center in Jeddah, is still a captive. It is not known precisely why, and he has never been charged, although the New York Times quoted a friend saying he was being pressured to give evidence against a relative.
He has been tortured during his captivity. He was reportedly grabbed from his room at the Ritz, slapped, blindfolded, stripped to his underwear, bound to a chair, shocked with electricity and whipped so severely that he could not sleep on his back for days.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.

Texto completo: Investigators have not determined the cause of Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed all 157 people aboard, but the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have both been recovered, the airline said.
The two recorders will need to be taken to a specialized center to read their data, said Lynnette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London.
"If the boxes are intact, then they will be able to take the data off them and look at it immediately," Dray said.
But if they are dented or burned, the data might not be easily extractable.
"They might need to decontaminate them, or adjust smoke components first," she said.
Dray said the two recorders would be treated slightly differently.Some of the flight data, which generally includes information about speed, air pressure and other details, might already be known to investigators. But the cockpit voice recorder, which captures anything that might have been said or heard by the captain and co-pilot, can be more revealing -- and more sensitive, Dray said.
China and Indonesia ordered their airlines Monday to ground all of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft that they operate.
The Indonesian Transport Ministry on Monday called for the temporary grounding of the planes operated by Indonesian carriers, following the fatal accidents involving two new aircraft of that model.
The first accident came in October, when a Lion Air flight crashed in Indonesia, minutes after an erratic takeoff. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Airlines flight went down shortly after leaving Bole Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with an unstable trajectory.
After Lion Air Flight 610 nosedived into the sea shortly after taking off from the airport in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, killing all 189 people on board, the Transport Ministry grounded all Max 8s operating in the country. But after inspections were conducted last November, the planes were declared safe to fly.
Indonesian and U.S. aviation authorities have raised the possibility that Flight 610's crash was because of pilots fighting an automated anti-stall software in the Max model that may have been erroneously activated by incorrect flight data.
China's main airlines are among the biggest users so far of the new Boeing jets, having taken delivery of most of the planes they have ordered.
Ethiopian Airlines officials said Monday they would ground all Boeing 737 Max planes in their country. And Cayman Airways said it was temporarily grounding its two Boeing 737 Max 8 planes.
Several airlines indicated on Monday that they would not ground their Boeing 737 Max jets, or, in some cases, had no plans to cancel orders.

Texto completo: More than 11/2 tons of cocaine was seized in Newark, in the largest cocaine bust at Port Newark in 25 years, authorities said.
On Feb. 28, about 1.6 tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $77 million, was seized at Port Newark, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced in a statement. The seizure was the result of a joint raid by CBP, the U.S. Coast Guard, Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the New York Police Department and the New York State Police.
"This is a significant seizure, in fact it is the largest cocaine seizure at the Port of New York/Newark since May 1994," Troy Miller, director of CBP's New York Field Operations, said in the statement. "This interception prevents a massive quantity of drugs from getting to the streets and in the hands of our children."
CBP turned over the mass shipment of cocaine to Homeland Security Investigations, which will continue to investigate.
The multiple-agency effort to seize drugs at ports of entry is meant to intercept them before they're disseminated throughout the country, preventing the drugs from ever reaching the streets. Cocaine, much like heroin, is often cut with fentanyl, a powerful opioid that is up to 100 times stronger than morphine and often causes fatal overdoses.
"Cocaine, New York's nemesis of the '90s, is back — indicating traffickers' push to build an emerging customer base of users mixing cocaine with fentanyl," said Ray Donovan, DEA special agent in charge.
The drug bust is the largest at Port Newark this century. In May 1994, more than 3 tons of cocaine was discovered in cargo at the port, The New York Times reported. CBP agents staked out those drugs, waiting for the shipment to be broken down and distributed. Three men were arrested in July that year.

BATTLE OVER BUYBACKS STOCK BUYBACKS DON'T ONLY ENRICH SHAREHOLDERS

Texto completo: The latest pitched battle between Corporate America and its critics involves stock buybacks: large companies' purchases of their own shares on the stock market. The aim is to raise share prices and satisfy investors. But the practice has triggered outrage from critics, who argue that the buybacks discourage productive investment, higher wages and worker retraining. Big business is accused of sacrificing the nation's future for short-term greed.
No one disputes that buybacks - once rare - have soared. In 2018, companies in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 firms spent a record $753 billion on buybacks, up 40 percent from 2017 and more than triple the level of 2007, according to one estimate. Buybacks now overshadow dividends as the way companies return funds to shareholders. In 2018, dividends from these same S&P 500 firms totaled $449 billion, slightly less than in 2017. The buybacks reduced the number of shares of the S&P companies by 3 percent.
The biggest economic sectors using buybacks are IT companies at $255 billion, financial firms at $137 billion and health care firms at $91 billion. Companies that have announced buybacks include Boeing, Johnson & Johnson and Facebook, reports business channel CNBC.
What encourages buybacks?
One reason is convenience. When companies raise dividends, they are reluctant to reverse the increases - that's an almost-certain warning that a firm is in deep trouble - except in cases of extreme financial distress. By contrast, buybacks can be turned on and off to reflect the state of the economy, the stock market and companies' individual circumstances.
Another attraction is the stock price itself. Many executives believe their stock is undervalued. Buybacks try to nudge up the price by spreading the same profit over fewer shares. President Donald Trump's large corporate tax cut also spurred buybacks because some of that money was funneled to shareholders, as Donald Marron of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has indicated.
Not surprisingly, there's a backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a staunch critic of buybacks, recently denounced the practice in a series of scathing tweets. Here's a sampling.
"The justification for corporate buybacks is [a] company has no better investment available. This may be true for any company from time to time. But what does it say when it is true for many companies year after year? ... Why are profits not being invested into [the] company or new companies?"
Here are Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., writing on the op-ed page of the New York Times:
"[Buybacks reduce companies' capacity] to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining."
What to believe? By rhetoric, the critics seem winners. Corporate America seems to be hunkering down and enjoying short-term returns at the expense of the future. But this is a superficial reading.
On paper, it seems reasonable to discourage buybacks by imposing stiff taxes on them. However, this is more difficult than it seems. For starters, the present tax rate for Americans receiving capital gains from buybacks is the same as the tax rate on dividends, 23.8 percent, notes Steven M. Rosenthal, also of the Tax Policy Center. Buybacks aren't being wildly subsidized.
Even if they were, the effect of raising the tax on buybacks would be modest, Mr. Rosenthal says. Many investors are tax-exempt. These include foreign investors in U.S. stocks, U.S. pension funds, IRAs, 401(K) plans and various tax-exempt institutions. Altogether they represent about 75 percent of publicly traded U.S. shares, says Mr. Rosenthal. All these non-taxable investors would still have reason to favor buybacks.
More important, even banning buybacks outright might not work as critics think. Imagine a world in which buybacks are illegal and companies hoard most of the funds now used for buybacks. (Messrs. Schumer and Sanders support one such approach.) All that spare cash might encourage executives to undertake wasteful projects or to engineer ever-larger mergers - and be criticized by the same critics for doing so.
Buybacks are the better solution. Funnel some of companies' surplus profits to shareholders, who can best decide what to do with the cash.

Texto completo: Benn Steil, the author of "The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War," has been named the winner of the New-York Historical Society's Barbara and David Zalaznick Book Prize, awarded each year to the best work in the field of American history or biography.
The 600-plus-page book, published last year by Simon and Schuster, chronicled America's contribution to the reconstruction of Europe in the emerging post-World War II world order. Timothy Naftali, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called it "trenchant and timely," adding that "the architects of America's global engagement after World War II would have been appalled that future generations -- let alone a future president -- might think they had been acting in anything but the national interest."
In a statement, Mr. Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, echoed that point, indirectly linking his book to today's debates about trade, global alliances and America's place in the world.
"It is ebbing from the national consciousness just what it was that made America great," he said. "The creation, implementation and legacy of the Marshall Plan define its essence."
The award, named for the philanthropists Barbara and David Zalaznick, comes with a $50,000 award. Past winners include John A. Farrell, Jane Kamensky, Eric Foner and Jill Lepore.
Mr. Steil will receive the prize on April 12 as part of the historical society's Weekend with History, a private event.

DeLauro: Congress must appropriate funding for gun violence research

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — Though it is known that the rate of gun deaths are on the rise in the country, some experts are interested in what is unknown about gun violence.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, announced Monday that, in light of this and as chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she will advocate for the appropriation of money to research gun violence.
“Gun violence is a public health emergency,” she said at New Haven Police Department headquarters. “It demands public research dollars.”
According to CDC statistics that were released in 2018, the New York Times reported, nearly 40,000 died from firearm injuries in 2017, the third consecutive year the rate had increased. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were suicides.
Since 1996, Congress has followed a provision called the Dickey Amendment, which forbids any research by the CDC that could be used to promote gun control. DeLauro said that, despite sepsis and gun violence both claiming about the same number American lives, sepsis received 150 times as much funding for CDC research.
DeLauro noted that Jay Dickey, the Arkansas representative for whom the amendment is named, has “recanted,” declaring in 2015 that gun violence should be researched by the CDC.
Recent attempts to repeal the amendment, with mostly Democratic support, have been unsuccessful. DeLauro said she is not opposed to the Dickey Amendment if having it in place “soothes” the concerns of gun control opponents into supporting a bipartisan consensus on gun violence research.
“We are going to push to make sure the CDC is involved,” DeLauro said.
She said she cannot “account for what happens in the Senate,” where Democrats are a minority, “but an overwhelming victory in the House will place pressure.”
Police Chief Anthony Campbell said the department believes in “data-driven policing,” which would be made possible with more research into gun violence.
Kirsten Bechtel, co-principal investigator of the Injury Free Coalition for Kids at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital said federal funding for gun violence should at least be proportionate with the number of deaths related to guns. She said that, although far more American households have access to a car than to a firearm, car deaths declined dramatically after research was done on safety measures such as car seats for infants.
Bechtel made a request of DeLauro that she fund the National Institutes of Health as well; DeLauro said there was a funding precedent there following the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, but those projects were discontinued. DeLauro said the NIH and CDC both would be directed to conduct research on gun violence.
Karl Minges, director of the University of New Haven’s master’s in public health program, said gun deaths are “100 percent preventable,” and there are many questions that can be researched to decrease deaths, such as why gun violence has increased, who gun violence affects disproportionately, correlations between domestic violence and gun violence and the effects of gun violence on the urban poor.
Minges said if the federal government tracked gun deaths then it would be an effective epidemiological tool.
Brent Peterkin, statewide coordinator of Project Longevity — a Connecticut-based program that uses social-emotional strategies to reduce gun violence — said the emotional and economic toll that gun violence has on families and communities is obvious, but underexplored. He said there must be trauma-informed research for people to draw upon to help families mourning gun deaths and children who have been targeted by gun violence.
“We must consider how this impacts black and brown communities,” he said.

Texto completo: Most Americans understand the fundamental, constitutional principle that every person, no matter how horrible the crime he or she is accused of committing, is entitled to be represented by a lawyer. It is a bedrock right, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
But not everyone appreciates or understands how vital that principle is to freedom, liberty and due process. Even some of the supposedly best and brightest students in the country — at Harvard University — recently demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the right to counsel.
Harvard Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr. is an extremely accomplished defense lawyer who has helped to free prisoners who were wrongfully convicted and incarcerated. As a former public defender, Sullivan represented many people accused of crimes.
But Sullivan has come under intense scrutiny recently, with some Harvard students even calling for Sullivan's resignation from his faculty dean position. The students are not doing so because Sullivan committed some heinous crime or moral wrong.
Instead, the students are calling for Sullivan's resignation because Sullivan is representing one of the most hated figures of our time — Harvey Weinstein.
There is no question that Weinstein is a deeply reviled figure. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct and, in some cases, sexual assault. Weinstein faces criminal charges in a Manhattan sexual abuse trial relating to accusations by two of those women.
Student protesters recently demonstrated against Sullivan, carrying signs that read "Remove Sullivan" and "#MeToo."
An online petition calling for Sullivan's resignation includes harsh criticisms of Sullivan. For example, according to The New York Times, a student named Danu Mudannayake wrote, "Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?" Mudannayake told the Times that Sullivan's representation of Weinstein "disrupted the safe atmosphere of their community."
Vandals recently spray painted the doors of Winthrop House at Harvard (the faculty-led residence where Sullivan is dean) with words condemning Sullivan as a result of his representation of Weinstein: "Down W Sullivan!", "Our rage is self-defense," "Whose side are you on?" and "Your silence is violence."
Sullivan told The New Yorker that he has received strong support, silently, from some students but that those students feel they cannot say anything publicly "because they will be tarred and feathered as 'rape sympathizers.'"
The protesting students are demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of the Sixth Amendment and the right to counsel. It is just as important that the most unpopular people accused of the most heinous crimes get zealous representation — the same representation to which every other person accused of a crime is constitutionally entitled.
It is true that Sullivan did not have to agree to represent Weinstein. But Sullivan understands, as did many of our nation's founders and former presidents, how important it is for those accused of crimes to be represented by competent, skilled defense lawyers.
Before he was president, Abraham Lincoln was a criminal defense lawyer. Lincoln was known to be an extremely thorough, zealous advocate for his clients. Lincoln did not just represent people accused of petty crimes. Lincoln defended people accused the most serious crimes, such as murder.
John Adams, our nation's second president and a man who helped write the Declaration of Independence, believed strongly in the principle that every person accused of a crime is entitled to a lawyer. After the Boston Massacre, where British solders were accused of murdering Bostonians, Adams was one of the criminal defense lawyers who represented the British soldiers. It was an incredibly unpopular case. The British soldiers were among the most reviled people at the time.
John Adams was a Harvard alumnus who wrote that his vigorous defense of the British soldiers was "one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country."
Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig wrote, in an interview with The Atlantic, regarding the controversy involving Sullivan: "I was raped repeatedly as a boy. I would have no problem with Sullivan representing the man who raped me. That's because I have a clear sense of how vicious and arbitrary the criminal justice system can be. That knowledge leads me to believe that we should encourage adequate representation, not scorn excellent representatives. Defending a criminal defendant is not to defense a crime. That understanding is fundamental to a just criminal justice system."
The protesting Harvard students calling for Sullivan's resignation because of his representation of an unpopular client should learn from history and understand that their actions are detrimental, and even dangerous, to our constitutional guarantees and to fairness, liberty and due process in our criminal justice system.

Texto completo: It’s a happy accident that the five books I’m looking forward to reading this spring are all by women, and an even happier one that this column coincides with Women’s History Month:
The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker – San Diego hometown girl, UCLA alum, and New York Times bestselling author.
In her previous novel, “The Age of Miracles,” Walker imagines a world where the days and nights are inexplicably growing longer while her young protagonist, Julia, is experiencing her own off-kilter experience of adolescence. Walker’s new novel has a similar theme: Inexplicably, the residents of a small Southern California college town are falling asleep, and they don’t wake up. The only clue to this mysterious illness is that the sleepers are experiencing unusually high levels of brain activity that suggest heightened dreams. Vogue, Huffington Post, Real Simple, and BuzzFeed all called Walker’s second novel one of the most anticipated books of 2019, and I’m not surprised. Walker has an exquisite ability to imagine near-future dystopian circumstances that illuminate the provocative reality of the human experience. (Out now)
The Other Americans by Laila Lalami – Critically acclaimed novelist, Pulitzer-Prize finalist, American Book Award-winner, Los Angeles Times critic-at-large, Fulbright Fellowship recipient, Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and UC Riverside creative writing professor.
Lalami’s newest novel tells the story of Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant in California killed by a speeding car while crossing the street. Lalami introduces an extraordinary cast of characters, each connected to the event in some way, as this family saga and murder mystery are woven to reveal a tapestry of immigration and “other” in America. The book has received rave reviews from the likes of Roxane Gay, J.M. Coetzee, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, and it was named one of the most anticipated books for 2019 by Entertainment Weekly, The Boston Globe, and New York Magazine/Vulture. It’s also received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. (Out March 26)
The City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders – Award-winning novelist (Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Lambda Literary Award); prolific short story writer (Tin House, Monkey Bicycle, and Boston Review, to name a few); organizer of the monthly San Francisco reading series Writers with Drinks; publisher, along with Annalee Newitz, of the magazine other; and the creator of the Ballerina Pie Fight — and yeah, it’s exactly what you think it is.
That’s a lot about the author and not a lot about the book, but imagine a tale of a dying planet and its reluctant young revolutionary, Sophie, told by the person I just described and you’ll see why this novel is compelling enough to be named one of Book Riot’s Most Anticipated Books of 2019. (Out now)
Magical Negro by Morgan Parker – Author of “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” (a Time magazine Best Paperback of 2017) among others; National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship recipient; Pushcart-Prize winner; writer for The Paris Review, Best American Poetry, The New York Times, and The Nation; creator and host of Reparations, Live! at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, and an Angeleno.
Wry. Intelligent. Lyrical. Urgent. Atmospheric. Profound. These are just some of the adjectives used to describe this important book of poetry about black womanhood that Publishers Weekly awarded a starred review. (Out now)
Finding Dorothy by Elizabeth Letts – New York Times bestselling author whose writing career was inspired in part by Mrs. Barclay, the children’s librarian at Malaga Cove Library in Palos Verdes.
Letts imagines the life of Maud Gage Baum, wife of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” author Frank Baum, taking the reader back to 1938 and Hollywood’s production of her late husband’s masterpiece. Seventy-seven-year-old Maud — the daughter of a suffragette and one of the first women in the Ivy League — is determined to ensure that the film’s producers stay true to the spirit of the real secrets behind it which only she knows. Letts started writing at the age of 40 with much success: two New York Times bestsellers and a BookPage starred review for this newest book. (Out now)
This eclectic list of accomplished women celebrates the rich diversity of California authors and the power of the female voice offering us the perfect reading list for Women’s History Month.

'I Didn't Mean to Be Brave'

Texto completo: "I should let you know I am not O.K.," said the actress Maddie Corman, 49. She was in gray jeans and a T-shirt, barefoot in a small studio on the first day of rehearsal for the play she has written and will star in, "Accidentally Brave." "This is not one of those shows where I'm here to tell you that I was O.K., and then I wasn't O.K., but now I am."
Ms. Corman gestured behind her, where an image of her and her husband, the director Jace Alexander, would be projected onto a screen. They would appear alongside an article from The New York Times highlighting the couple's wedding 21 years ago.
At the time, a friend described a young Ms. Corman as "incredibly open and loving" -- a rarity in the world of film, he said. "Oddly," he continued, "she's only become more so, which makes me fear for her at times, but I also admire her bravery."
"Brave" was not what Ms. Corman set out to be. But three and a half years ago, while driving to work on a "semi-terrible TV show," as she put it, she got a phone call that can't even be described as the kind of call nobody wants to get because it would never even occur to most people that this call would be possible. The police were at her house, her teenage daughter sobbed through the receiver. Her husband had been arrested on child pornography charges.
What do you do when your husband of two decades -- father of your three children -- is suddenly revealed publicly to have a shameful and disturbing secret?
If you're Ms. Corman, at first you think there must be a terrible mistake. This was a man who, as she says onstage, "listens to NPR and makes bad jokes and sings songs at the piano and reads The New Yorker and plans for the future and who doesn't flirt with my friends." How can this be? she recalled thinking.
When the police made it clear it was not a mistake, she pulled over to the side of the road and threw up. She picked up her husband on a street corner in Brooklyn, after he was released on bail, and she asked him if it was true (yes, and he said he needed help) and if he had ever touched anyone (he swore he had not). Then she punched him, and she sobbed, and she called her kids and reassured them that everything was going to be O.K., even though, as she puts it in the play, "I do not recognize the voice coming out of my mouth."
Ms. Corman returned to the set of the semi-terrible show the next day, because she had to -- who knew if her husband would ever work again -- and she bummed a cigarette even though she didn't smoke, and she somehow did her lines, and she kept wondering, do I tell anyone?
That question became irrelevant, because an article about the arrest would soon appear in The New York Post.
But this was just the beginning of a journey -- "Oh my God, I hate the word 'journey,"' Ms. Corman said during rehearsal, opting instead for "thing" -- she would embark on, which is not yet over. Somewhere along the way, she began writing it all down, workshopping it with a friend, the director Kristin Hanggi, who reached out in one of Ms. Corman's low moments and who seemed not to be judging.
Ms. Hanggi encouraged her to turn the writing into a one-woman play, which opens this month at the DR2 Theater. It is directed by Ms. Hanggi ("Rock of Ages") and produced by the Tony winner Daryl Roth ("Gloria: A Life"), who said she had "admired Maddie as an actress, and am now equally impressed with her writing."
The title -- "Accidentally Brave" -- is a reference to the people, the many people, who kept telling Ms. Corman "how 'brave' I was," she said. "I didn't mean to be brave, but this is what I was dealt."
Oh, and here's what she calls the spoiler: Nearly four years later, after rehab, an ongoing 12-step program, couples therapy and much anguished wrestling with questions of ethics, family and the nature of forgiveness, she and her husband remain married.
At home on a recent morning in Harlem, where she now lives with her husband and their 15-year-old twin boys (her daughter is away at college), she sat cross-legged on her bed, her husband beside her, ticking off her list of fears about making their story even more public than it already is.
"I mean, a new fear pops up every day," she said.
She is afraid she will hurt her children more than they've already been hurt. She is afraid of what people will say -- not just about what her husband did but of her decision to stay with him. She is worried that, by virtue of staying, she is somehow undermining the women who have so bravely spoken up to say #MeToo -- of which she is also one. (Last year, Ms. Corman was one of nine women who spoke out against the playwright Israel Horovitz.)
"And then there are the technical fears: How is it all going to come together," she said. "So it's the fears of a writer, the fears of an actor and the fears of a human all combined into one soup."
She paused. "But then I do remember that living it was scarier than doing this."
In 2016, Jace Alexander pleaded guilty to two felony counts related to possessing and sharing illegal and obscene performances of sexual conduct by a child under 17. He was sentenced to 10 years probation and had to register as a sex offender.
Shortly after, Ms. Corman and Mr. Alexander sold their family home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., where they had lived a town over from her father and a few houses away from his mother, the actress Jane Alexander. They are now renters. "It's a really small town," Ms. Corman said of their former home. "Everyone, everyone knew." Their children switched schools. Ms. Corman became the family breadwinner.
Her husband, best known for his work on "Law & Order," is now producing a documentary -- working title: "Tsunami" -- about the destructive forces of pornography.
"You've had the worst thing you've ever done exposed to the entire world," said Mr. Alexander, who spent a month and a half in an inpatient rehabilitation facility and remains part of a 12-step program for sex addicts. "It was incredibly painful and incredibly destructive, but it allowed me to reinvestigate the way I lived my life."
As for sharing that story with the world, he said, "Maddie has always said to me, a huge element of telling this story is service."
But this play is not about the details of her husband's crimes, or what may have led him there (the play hints at "what happened to him in his childhood"). "That is not my story to tell," Ms. Corman said. Rather, "Accidentally Brave" is her story -- "my own messy truth," she said. While her husband, she said, has been entirely supportive of her doing it, she said he has not read the script.
"It feels like there's this thing in our society where something terrible happens, and then you go away," Ms. Corman explained. "Nobody sees you for a while, and then you come back, and you either say, 'I'm married' or 'I'm not married' or 'I'm better' or 'I'm not better,' but here I am. I'm back, and let's not talk about what happened between then and now."
"I was just so hungry to know what happened in the middle," she continued. "Like forget about the topic of what my husband did -- that's taboo enough. But in some ways even more taboo is how you deal with the mess and the betrayal and all of it."
How do you repair a relationship that has been torn apart at the seams? What do you do with all that anger?
And how do you cope with the everyday things that pop up moment to moment -- phone calls about removing your name from charity events, a request to return soccer equipment to the team because obviously your husband can no longer be your kids' coach, or your daughter needing childhood photos for a school project, which you no longer have because they were all on the hard drive that was seized by the police?
It is not a play with a tidy happy ending, and Ms. Corman would not say now that she has a tidy, happy marriage. She is still working through deep feelings of shame and betrayal and suspects she will be for a very long time.
"I'm not going to suddenly be the person that I was," she said. "I mean, I still wake up in the middle of the night. I have flashbacks. But because I've had this happen, I actually have a much bigger toolbox to deal with these feelings when they come."
And there are times -- in the play and just in life -- when she can still laugh.
She described a friend who tried to bring over sleeping pills but couldn't find them so instead brought their dog's Prozac. When Ms. Corman realized she would soon no longer be able to host trick-or-treaters at Halloween, she purchased 27 pumpkins and decorated them all.
In one hilarious scene, she introduces her daughter to a young woman she hopes her daughter might be friends with and is convinced that she made a wonderful impression -- only to have her daughter point out that she had been gripping a book in her arms, cover side out: "Mending a Shattered Heart: A Guide for Partners of Sex Addicts."
"We laughed -- hard," Ms. Corman says onstage. "I think we may have even sung."
And then there were the text messages from friends, trying to be helpful, that read like a staccato of what not to say:
"When are you filing for divorce?"
"Do NOT get divorced"
"My husband has had a few hookers."
"I watch tranny porn."
"So he's at Perv Camp?"
"I hate having sex with my husband."
"You should see what's on my laptop!"
"At least he didn't die."
"Do you worry that he will kill himself?"
"My husband died which I think is way easier than what you're going through."
Let me be clear, Ms. Corman said later: Most of the time, it was not funny.
"If I could have kept it a secret, I probably would have," she said.
But she didn't have a choice. And so, the way she sees it, speaking about the unspeakable might help someone else whose life is turned upside down, who is forced to test the limits of her own capacity for forgiveness in the face of something terrible.
"I wouldn't wish what happened to me or my kids on anyone," she said. "But the way that I feel, and honestly the way that my husband feels, is that when we keep things in the dark, that's when shame and pain actually grows."
"Our family," she continued, "didn't just stop being because something terrible happened."

Texto completo: EAST LANSING - Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut this week with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle.
Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well.
Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM FILES GENDER EQUITY SUIT » The world's No. 1-ranked women's soccer team, featuring a handful of Bay Area players, has filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation, in another challenge against the disparity in representation of men and women in sports.
All 28 members of the team training for the upcoming 2019 Women's Cup in France filed the suit Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleging discrimination in pay, complaints about conditions on the field and discriminatory treatment of the players overall.
The New York Times first reported the filing, which also seeks class-action status to represent all women who have been members of the national team since Feb. 4, 2015.

Robert Samuelson: A primer on the buyback battle

Información de publicación: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]. 09 Mar 2019.

Resumen: In 2018, companies in the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 firms spent a record $753 billion on buybacks, up 40 percent from 2017 and more than triple the level of 2007, according to an analysis by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a research and advocacy group for financial firms. Why are profits not being invested into [the] company or new companies?” Or here are Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., writing on the op-ed page of the New York Times: “[Buybacks reduce companies’ capacity] to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining.” For starters, the present tax rate for Americans receiving capital gains from buybacks is the same as the tax rate on qualified dividends, 23.8 percent, notes Steven M. Rosenthal, also of the Tax Policy Center.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The latest pitched battle between Corporate America and its critics involves stock buybacks: Large companies’ purchases of their own shares on the stock market. The aim is to raise share prices and satisfy investors. But the practice has triggered outrage from critics, who argue that the buybacks discourage productive investment, higher wages and worker retraining. Big business is accused of sacrificing the nation’s future for short-term greed.
Here’s the background.
No one disputes that buybacks — once rare — have soared. In 2018, companies in the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 firms spent a record $753 billion on buybacks, up 40 percent from 2017 and more than triple the level of 2007, according to an analysis by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a research and advocacy group for financial firms.
Buybacks now overshadow dividends as the way companies return funds to shareholders. In 2018, dividends from these same S&P 500 firms totaled $449 billion, slightly less than in 2017, says the IIF analysis. The buybacks reduced the number of shares of the S&P companies by 3 percent, the IIF estimates.
The biggest economic sectors using buybacks are information technology companies (example: Microsoft) at $255 billion, financial firms (JPMorgan Chase) at $137 billion and health care firms (Pfizer) at $91 billion. Companies that have announced buybacks include Boeing, Johnson & Johnson and Facebook, reports CNBC, the business news channel.
What encourages buybacks? There are many causes.
One is convenience. When companies raise dividends, they are reluctant to reverse the increases — that’s an almost-certain warning that a firm is in deep trouble — except in cases of extreme financial distress. By contrast, buybacks can be turned on and off to reflect the state of the economy, the stock market and companies’ individual circumstances.
Another attraction is the stock price itself. Many executives “believe their stock is undervalued,” as CNBC puts it. Buybacks try to nudge up the price — not always successfully — by spreading the same profit over fewer shares. President Trump’s large corporate tax cut also spurred buybacks, because some of that money was funneled to shareholders, as Donald Marron of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has indicated.
(Note: Some stories put the 2018 buyback total at more than $1 trillion, compared with the IIF’s $753 billion. The difference, says the IIF, is that its figures cover only buybacks that have occurred. The higher numbers also include announcements of buybacks that haven’t been consummated.)
Not surprisingly, there’s a backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a staunch critic of buybacks, recently denounced the practice in a series of scathing tweets. Here’s a sampling.
“The justification for corporate buybacks is [a] company has no better investment available. This may be true for any company from time to time. But what does it say when it is true for many companies year after year? … Why are profits not being invested into [the] company or new companies?”
Or here are Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., writing on the op-ed page of the New York Times:
“[Buybacks reduce companies’ capacity] to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining.”
What to believe? By rhetoric, the critics seem winners. Corporate America seems to be hunkering down and enjoying short-term returns at the expense of the future. But this is a superficial reading.
On paper, it seems reasonable to discourage buybacks by imposing stiff taxes on them. However, this turns out to be harder than it seems. For starters, the present tax rate for Americans receiving capital gains from buybacks is the same as the tax rate on qualified dividends, 23.8 percent, notes Steven M. Rosenthal, also of the Tax Policy Center. Buybacks aren’t being wildly subsidized.
Even if they were, the effect of raising the tax on buybacks would be modest, Rosenthal says. Many investors are tax-exempt. These include foreign investors in U.S. stocks, U.S. pension funds, IRAs, 401(k)s, and other tax-exempt institutions. All together they represent about 75 percent of publicly traded U.S. shares, says Rosenthal. All these non-taxable investors would still have reason to favor buybacks.
More important, even banning buybacks outright might not work as critics think. Imagine a world in which buybacks are illegal and companies hoard most of the funds now used for buybacks. (Schumer and Sanders support one such approach.) All that spare cash might encourage executives to undertake wasteful projects or to engineer ever-larger mergers — and be criticized by the same critics for doing so.
Buybacks are the better solution. Funnel some of companies’ surplus profits to shareholders, who can best decide what to do with the cash.

Texto completo: Stock finished lower Friday after a disappointing February jobs report that capped a week of losses for the markets. Investors remain concerned about a global economic slowdown following a string of downbeat news.
The Dow Jones Industrial average slipped 23 points, or 0. 09 percent, to end at 25,450 on Friday. Its five-day decline this week marked its longest losing streak since June.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 index declined 6 points, or 0. 21 percent, to close at 2,743, ending its worst week of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 0. 18 percent at 7,408.
Market watchers got a jolt Friday morning when the Labor Department reported that employers added just 20,000 jobs in February. That was far below the 180,000 Bloomberg consensus and marked the fewest gains since September 2017 when major hurricanes hurt hiring.
Experts blamed the harsh weather and the lingering effects of the federal shutdown for the discouraging figure.
Jobs report: Economy added just 20,000 jobs in February amid slowing growth, snowy weather
Market predictions: Stocks: The record bull market is 10 years old. Is it about to flame out or surge higher?
Mild weather in January helped to boost gains in that month, while above-average snowfall when the Labor Department conducted its survey in February was predicted to cut total hiring estimates by 40,000, according to Goldman Sachs.
The unemployment rate fell to 3. 8 percent from 4 percent in February, according to the government, as federal workers who identified as unemployed or on temporary leave in January returned to work.
The report offered a handful of silver linings. Job gains for December and January were revised up by a total 12,000, while average hourly earnings posted a 3. 4-percent annual gain, the highest since April 2009.
Jobs report winners and losers: Manufacturing workers, black men among losers in February jobs report

Texto completo: Once Major League Baseball’s spring training camps open, the publishing industry gets ready to launch dozens of new baseball books. As baseball fans shake off the winter blues, commercial and academic presses hope fans will want to warm themselves and get ready for a new season by reading about baseball’s past seasons.
The most noteworthy baseball book published last year was Jane Leavy’s "The Big Fella: Babe Ruth and the World He Created," published by HarperCollins. A New York Times bestseller, it was named baseball’s best history or biography for 2018 by the Society for American Baseball Research.
In "The Big Fella," Leavy, as she did in her biography of Sandy Koufax, takes a single event, in this case Ruth’s barnstorming tour in 1927 with Lou Gehrig, as the centerpiece for her narrative of Ruth’s life from his early days when he was sent by his father to a Baltimore orphanage to his extraordinary and tumultuous career with the New York Yankees — a career that, Leavy contends, changed America’s culture. No one roared more during the Roaring Twenties than Babe Ruth.
The reason that Leavy selected the 1927 barnstorming tour was that Ruth was coming off the most monumental and memorable season of his career. In 1927, he hit 60 home runs, a record that would stand until the Yankees’ Roger Maris broke it in 1961 with the help of a season expanded from 154 to 162 games. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees, with Ruth hitting the only home runs, swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games.
Ruth’s 1927 barnstorming tour lasted three weeks and took him cross-country from New Jersey to California. At every stop, Ruth was mobbed by fans, who often disrupted the game by storming the field. Leavy uses the fan frenzy to illustrate Ruth’s hold, at the height of his career, on the imagination of Americans and the difficulty of finding the man behind the legend.
While Leavy’s book claims it breaks through "the mythology that has obscured the legend and delivers the man," "The Big Fella" spends most of its narrative recounting the gargantuan appetites and herculean feats that transformed Ruth into an American idol. There was, however, another Ruth biography published last year that does cut through the legend to get at the man.
Edmund Wehrle’s "Breaking Babe Ruth: Baseball’s Campaign Against Its Biggest Star," published by the University of Missouri Press, unveils Ruth as more victim than hero. Fearing that Ruth was becoming bigger than the game, baseball owners and their commissioner, abetted by sportswriters who portrayed Ruth as a ignorant man-child, used threats, fines and suspensions to control Ruth, eventually forcing him into submission.
While Ruth was a free spirit and often defied baseball’s establishment, the reserve clause gave the owners the weapon they needed to stifle Ruth. While he had a running battle with Yankee ownership over his salary, he had no option other than holding out or making an idle threat to leave the game.
Toward the end of his career, Ruth, struggling with injuries and illness, gave in to ownership demands because he wanted to become a major league manager after his playing career was over. But baseball’s establishment, once the aging Ruth was no longer a threat, exploited the image of Ruth as a man-child incapable of managing himself and blackballed him.
When Ruth died of cancer on Aug. 16, 1948, at the age of 53, an estimated 82,000 mourners wound around Yankee Stadium, where Ruth’s body lay in state. Over 6,000 surrounded St. Patrick’s Cathedral for Ruth’s funeral mass. While sportswriters lamented the loss of the Big Fella and celebrated his legendary exploits, the man who was finally laid to rest had his spirit broken before cancer eventually destroyed his body. * Reading Baseball is a series of stories and commentaries by Richard "Pete" Peterson, co-author with his son Stephen of "The Slide: Leyland, Bonds and the Star-Crossed Pittsburgh Pirates" and the editor of The St Louis Baseball Reader.

Texto completo: In a series of rulings over the past several decades interpreting the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court has prohibited the execution of some of the most helpless people in the nation, including children and people with intellectual disabilities.
On Wednesday, the court spared from execution Vernon Madison, who cannot remember the circumstances surrounding his 1985 conviction in Alabama for the murder of a police officer. Mr. Madison suffered at least two severe strokes after his conviction, and his lawyers had told the justices that he had vascular dementia and attendant cognitive decline.
As Justice Elena Kagan explained in a 5-to-3 decision siding with Mr. Madison, a faulty memory alone does not trigger the protections of the Eighth Amendment, just as the diagnosis of a mental illness alone would not. Instead, Justice Kagan wrote, what's relevant is whether the person possesses a "rational understanding" of why the state wants to impose the ultimate punishment. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who hadn't yet been confirmed when the court first heard the dispute, did not participate in Mr. Madison's case.)
In prior cases laying the foundation for this principle, the Supreme Court justices have reasoned that executing someone who can't rationally understand his crime or punishment "simply offends humanity" and would serve no "retributive value." Which is to say: If a man condemned to die can't comprehend the true meaning of society's judgment against him, what is the value of that condemnation?
"Do you have an independent recollection of the Civil War?" asked Justice Kagan in her opinion in Madison v. Alabama. "Obviously not. But you may still be able to reach a rational — indeed, a sophisticated — understanding of that conflict and its consequences."
The justice went on: "Do you recall your first day of school? Probably not. But if your mother told you years later that you were sent home for hitting a classmate, you would have no trouble grasping the story."
The same goes for a person who blacks out before committing a crime: She may still come to appreciate why a prosecutor seeks to punish her.
In Mr. Madison's case, the Supreme Court recognized that the Alabama court that weighed his mental capacities offered a cursory ruling, with "only one sentence of explanation" that didn't take into account the "sole question" that matters: "whether he can reach a 'rational understanding' of why the State wants to execute him."
The high court sent the case back to the lower courts for what Justice Kagan called a "do-over."
The lower courts may again conclude, based on the Supreme Court's guidance and expert medical testimony, that executing Mr. Madison doesn't qualify as cruel and unusual. But until then, the Supreme Court's decision — joined by the rest of the liberal bloc and Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — provides hope that officials may yet realize that it's inhumane to put to death someone too impaired to remember the crime he committed or comprehend the punishment he is facing.

Texto completo: Band to perform March 10 at Jewett Auditorium
A few years back, I had the chance to interview Stanley Keach about his band, the Sandy River Ramblers, and a show they had scheduled at the UCCPA. It was a fun chat, and when I found out that they were heading for a performance at Jewett Auditorium on March 10, I figured it was time to reconnect and see what’s been happening with Keach and crew since 2016.
Q: Have you performed at Jewett before?
Keach: Yeah, we’ve played there a couple of times. It’s a wonderful hall; we really like it.
Q: I haven’t been there in a long time, but I remember that there’s not a bad seat in the house.
Keach: No, it’s good. It’s really good.
Q: Oh, before I forget it, does the band have a website?
Keach: Our website’s gone south. But we have a YouTube channel, and we have a Facebook page — that’s what we usually use. We’ve got a lot of good videos because I’ve been taking a lot of video classes. So that’s what I usually send to people: links to the YouTube channel.
Q: Now, do I remember correctly that you have a CD out of original material?
Keach: Yeah, we made an album in 2012 — “Cry of the Loon & other original songs about Maine” — and we’re just finishing up a sequel album of more songs about Maine. This one’s to be called “Home in the Heart of Maine.” So we have a repertoire now of about 30 original songs about Maine topics.
Q: Oh, nice!
Keach: … that’s really our niche, sort of. Stylistically, we’re bluegrass or bluegrass/Americana, but we really specialize in songs about Maine. I don’t think our new album will be out by March 10, but it’ll be out shortly after that. We’ll feature a lot of the new songs at the show anyway — yeah, absolutely.
Q: Could you talk a bit about some of those new songs?
Keach: Sure. We’ve got, for example, a song called “Down Went Sonny Liston” about the (Muhammad) Ali/Liston fight in Lewiston — probably the biggest sporting event in Maine’s history, you know — and we have a song that Julie Davenport sings just beautifully called “The Knife Edge” about a woman and a Baxter Park ranger that died in a disastrous hike on Mount Katahdin in 1963.
Q: Are you the songwriter, or are the others involved?
Keach: I’m the main songwriter — other people write a little bit, but I’m the main songwriter. I’ve had a lot of my songs that we don’t do in the band recorded by some of the biggest names in bluegrass, and I won the Maine Songwriters Association’s Song of the Year contest in 2017 with a song called “On Boot Hill” — which we probably will do — that was also recorded by Ralph Stanley II. He’s the son of the legendary Ralph Stanley. That was a co-written song, but I wrote half of it. It was recorded last year.
Q: Wow, that must make you feel pretty good — talk about validation.
Keach: Oh, yeah. It’s so much work to pitch songs that I don’t really do it that much anymore, but it’s great to have your songs done at a really, really high level and have it be on the radio and stuff — it’s great.
Q: Just out of curiosity, what’s your take on the future of bluegrass in today’s musical climate?
Keach: I think it’s pretty strong. It’s changing a lot, and I’m kind of an ultra-traditionalist. So some of it irritates me, but I love that it is strong. There’s tons of bluegrass festivals, and I think it’s got a very strong presence and future right now. And then this category called Americana, I think we kind of fit into that. But it’s more Maine-icana not Americana, if you will. (Laughter).
Q: Well, it is important to keep the stories and heritage of Maine alive as far as the music goes.
Keach: Yeah, we’ve done pretty well with that. One of the band members, Dan Simons, and I had a video out of our “North Pond Hermit” song, which has 30,000 views on YouTube and many more views on “Bill Green’s Maine” and on the New York Times online video. We got more fame out of that than we have out of anything for a long time. I’m really big on that: celebrating things about Maine in our songs. Some of them are funny, like “Boots from L.L. Bean” and “Slow Down (You’ll Hit A Moose),” but there are a lot of serious ones, too.
Q: Speaking of band members, could you run through the line-up in the Sandy River Ramblers nowadays?
Keach: Sure. Dan Simons, he’s our mandolin player, and he’s the brother of TV star Tim Simons on “VEEP.” He’s the younger brother, and he’s a mandolin virtuoso. Then there’s Bud Godsoe. He’s our spectacular, driving banjo player who learned to play while working on the Alaska pipeline. And Julie Davenport, a few years out of college, is just a stunningly good lead singer who plays upright bass with us. We also have a 17-year-old singer Dana Reynolds, a high school student; she’s terrific. And our go-to fiddler right now is Finn Woodruff, a 20-year-old from Brunswick and a great fiddler. Those are the core members of our band. And besides having great instrumentalists, I believe we have really, really good vocal harmonies. We work hard at it and have great singers in the band.
Q: Is there anything, Stan, that you’d like me to pass on to the folks reading this article about your Jewett Auditorium performance?
Keach: I don’t know. I think we’ve covered most of it, but like I said, we’ll do a lot of the songs that are going to come out on a CD this spring.
Q: Oh, there’s one more thing I was going to ask. Do you do old bluegrass standards as well as original material?
Keach: You know, in a two-set concert, we will do a few standards, but we’ll have a big concentration on songs about Maine that we wrote.

Tech Tools That Help a TV Pro Find, and Tell, Stories

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Liz Day, a senior story editor for The Times's new television show, " The Weekly ," discussed the tech she's using.
"The Weekly" is something new that's coming from The Times. What should we know about it?
It's The Times's most ambitious TV project ever: a 30-minute documentary show, premiering in June, that will air on FX on Sunday nights and then stream on Hulu. We're taking great reporting from the Times newsroom and bringing it to TV for a new audience. You should tune in.
You've also worked at ProPublica and "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver." What kind of tech did you use in those workplaces?
At ProPublica, we used databases like LexisNexis Public Records for people-finding, Pacer for federal court records and Factiva for news clips. Because investigative reporters are often looking for those who don't want to be found, we'd also keep an eye out for weird sites that promised to unearth off-the-grid cellphone numbers or scrape the deep web.
ProPublica has a wonderful open-source culture devoted to the public interest. Anytime they got their hands on unruly government data, the talented folks there would build an app to make access easy. Thanks to them, you can look up your doctor to see how much money he or she gets from drug companies.
When I joined "Last Week Tonight," I discovered a whole new world of video that I hadn't known existed. Did you know there's a database where you can search all of President Trump's video appearances, including a vlog he kept from 2011 to 2014? Or that the wizards behind the Wayback Machine have a tool where you can search the closed captions for local, cable and network TV news from the last decade?
We also used Scripto, a program for writing and producing television that Stephen Colbert helped build.
What are your most important gadgets and apps for doing your job?
Lame answer but definitely my iPhone. Depending on the type of person I'm communicating with, I'll use text, Slack, WhatsApp or a regular old telephone call. On my laptop, I use Google Docs, Evernote, Scrivener, Airtable and Dropbox. We use Frame.io to share or watch cuts of episodes.
More old school: giant spiral-bound notebooks. It feels soothing to write in them. But if I need to work from home after hours, I sometimes end up having to take photos of my handwritten notes.
What tech do you love to use in your personal life and why?
My husband has Sonos speakers set up around our apartment. It often feels as if I use them to fill every moment at home with podcasts and news. Every once in a while, I remember how nice it is to listen to music instead.
For reading, I use email newsletters and Instapaper, and we share a Kindle account so we can read the same books. I use Twitter to find unusual news or stuff that makes me laugh. I fall down Instagram rabbit holes all the time. An unexpected app I still use is Foursquare. I love seeing all the spots where my husband and I went 10 years ago.
I have no interest in Alexa, but we do have SmartThings, which sends your phone an alert every time your front door opens. I just got a letter that our (low-tech) building is installing a new buzzer system that has facial recognition. So I guess I will be using that soon, too!
I was given Beats wireless headphones as a gift. Initially, I thought they were for teens, but now I wear them all the time for travel and sometimes even sleep in them.
I almost never go to brick-and-mortar stores anymore, so I enjoy buying little treats from New York Magazine's The Strategist. There's always a magic skin care potion or some other fun new product that promises to improve your life for $15.
What is your personal TV setup, and has it changed?
I cut the cord in 2008. It was funny because at the time, my job was to analyze what people liked to watch on TV. But on principle, I resent that there's barely any choice of cable TV providers.
I spent a while infecting my laptop with God-knows-what from various Napster-esque video streaming sites.
But now it's so easy. We have Apple TV, where we subscribe to apps from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Showtime and HBO and then buy anything else a la carte from iTunes. Sometimes, I listen to the audio podcast version of shows like "60 Minutes" or PBS's "Frontline."
I know that sounds like I must watch a lot of TV, but I swear I really don't. It's fun to follow the TV industry like sports -- keeping an eye on what's new, what's a hit and what has bombed. You can learn a lot about the world by understanding what people watch on TV!
What do you do to take a break from tech?
Hot yoga. Sixty minutes in a 100-plus-degree room standing on one leg. Or nightly walks around the neighborhood with my husband. No phones and just laughs.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Time Travelers Take Flight on a Chinese Excursion

Texto completo: "A Happy Excursion," a double concerto that has its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic, takes its title from an ancient Taoist text. But it could just as easily describe the joyous performance of its soloists, Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man.
They were at the top of their fields when they met in the 1990s: Mr. Ma, a superstar cellist; Ms. Wu, the world's leading pipa player and a tireless ambassador for that lutelike Chinese instrument. Living in the same small Boston suburb, they became quick friends and colleagues; they've played together at the White House and with Mr. Ma's Silkroad Ensemble.
[How Yo-Yo Ma wants Bach to save the world.]
Among their collaborators has been Zhao Lin, who wrote "A Happy Excursion" and, in the spirit of Silkroad, has already blended traditionally Eastern and Western instruments in another double concerto: "Duo" (2013), for cello and sheng, a Chinese reed instrument.
[Video: Wu Man: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert Watch on YouTube.]
His latest concerto -- a lush and cinematic work in three movements -- pairs the cello and the pipa, which dates back more than 2,000 years. (Compare that with the relatively young cello, created around the 16th century.) In an interview this week, Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu discussed the piece's meaning, and what their instruments sound like together. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How would you describe the character of this concerto?
YO-YO MA Zhao Lin comes from a very literary and artistic family. He has a sense of old and new, and really knows poetic traditions. In the second movement, Wu Man plays this theme -- it's a melody that goes back to around the year 700 A.D. But he picked that and said, "I'm going to actually do something with this movement that shows something from that era," the Tang dynasty.
[Video: Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man Rehearse Zhao Lin's "A Happy Excursion." The passage Mr. Ma describes begins around 1:55 in this clip. Watch on YouTube.]
WU MAN In the Tang dynasty, music is very different from modern Chinese music.
MA Zhao Lin also comes from Xi'an, which around the Tang dynasty had easily a population of over a million people. They had mosques, Buddhist temples and Christian churches. It was really open; they called it one of the golden ages. It was such a rich and open and multicultural society. So there is a kind of beauty to that movement, going back to this golden period.
The title, "A Happy Excursion," is a little misleading.
What do you mean?
WU In Chinese, everyone understands it. A better translation is that you're more a kind of scholar. It's the ideal life. With imagination, you can go everywhere you want to go.
MA You can go everywhere. And he takes us through time travel. The first movement is all about the beginning of things, different forces that come together and become China. We have that second movement, the golden period. And then we have the last movement, the present. It's in seven -- it's a very contemporary rhythmic sound -- but it has elements of the golden period in it. So the question is, how are we, in our present moment, going to evolve ourselves?
[Plan ahead with The New York Times's Culture Calendar.]
The timbres of your two instruments are so different. Does that pose a challenge?
WU I still remember the first time we played together. In the first rehearsal, I felt really bad and awkward because I didn't know how I could play with the cello. They do sound different. We changed how we produce sound on the instrument. [Speaking to Mr. Ma] You changed your bowing. But over 20 years we kind of got used to it, so the combination of pipa and cello is not strange to us anymore.
The pipa has a history as a court and solo instrument. But they can be produced for a bigger hall now, with steel strings instead of silk. We also use amplification.
MA Can I say something about Wu Man? Whether it's science, journalism or anything, you want people to take the profession further, setting the tone for what's desirable and what can advance.
[Video: Pipa Concerto: I. Allegro Watch on YouTube.]
Today, the pipa and Wu Man are kind of synonymous, and the instrument is normal. But it's because in 29 years she's gone from something that's exotic to absolutely accepted. She plays in cafes, stadiums, concert halls, museums. She's commissioned everybody: Lou Harrison, Philip Glass, Zhao Lin. The repertory was very small, but she has expanded it by several hundred thousand percent.
What does it mean that this piece -- and this instrument -- is represented onstage with the New York Philharmonic?
MA What I love about New York is that it's a world city. Depending on whom you ask, either that's a terrible thing or it's the most normal thing. You look at the New York Phil, and look at the number of Asians -- what we need, actually, is much more African-American and Latin-American representation, because those are our two largest minorities. I don't think either Wu Man or I feel odd being what we are. It feels normal to us. I'm not proud; I'm just glad.
WU It's music. Enjoy it.

Texto completo: CORRECTION APPENDED. Thousands, perhaps millions, of people who try to quit antidepressant drugs experience stinging withdrawal symptoms that last for months to years: insomnia, surges of anxiety, even so-called brain zaps, sensations of electric shock in the brain.
But doctors have dismissed or downplayed such symptoms, often attributing them to the recurrence of underlying mood problems.
The striking contrast between the patients' experience and their doctors' judgment has stirred heated debate in Britain, where last year the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists publicly denied claims of lasting withdrawal in "the vast majority of patients."
Patient-advocacy groups demanded a public retraction; psychiatrists, in the United States and abroad, came to the defense of the Royal College. Now, a pair of prominent British psychiatric researchers has broken ranks, calling the establishment's position badly mistaken and the standard advice on withdrawal woefully inadequate.
In a paper published Tuesday in Lancet Psychiatry, the authors argued that any responsible withdrawal regimen should have the patient tapering off medication over months or even years, depending on the individual, and not over four weeks, the boilerplate advice.
The paper is by far the strongest research-backed denunciation of standard tapering practice by members of the profession.
"I know people who stop suddenly and get no side effects," said Dr. Mark Horowitz, a clinical research fellow at Britain's National Health Service and University College London, and one of the paper's authors.
But many people, he said, "have to pull apart their capsules and reduce the dosage bead by bead. We provided the science to back up what they're already doing."
[ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter. ]
The field of psychiatry has conducted few rigorous studies of antidepressant withdrawal, despite the fact that long-term prescription rates in the United States and Britain have doubled over the past decade, with similar trends in other Western countries.
More than 15 million Americans have taken the medications for at least five years, a rate that has almost more than tripled since 2000, according to a New York Times analysis of federal data.
Outside researchers who have studied withdrawal said the new paper was a welcome contribution. "I think what they've presented really reinforces what I've observed in clinical practice in many patients, and it's almost identical to the tapering regimen I use," said Dr. Dee Mangin, the chair of family medicine at McMaster University in Canada, who was not involved in the paper.
Dr. Mangin, who is completing her own two-year study of Prozac withdrawal, added, "The other important thing is that it validates patients' own reports of their experiences. It's tremendously frustrating when patients describe a different experience than physicians expect, and don't feel they're being heard."
Dr. Horowitz and his co-author, Dr. David Taylor, a professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London and a member of the South London and Maudsley N.H.S. Foundation Trust, decided to address the topic in part because of their own experiences with medication.
Dr. Horowitz said he had severe withdrawal symptoms after tapering down after 15 years on antidepressants. Dr. Taylor had previously written about his own struggles trying to taper off.
The two researchers began by visiting online forums in which people on antidepressants advised one another how best to withdraw. Those sites consistently recommended "micro-dosing," reducing doses by ever smaller amounts over months or years, sometimes by removing one bead at a time from capsules.
The two researchers dug into the literature and found a handful of studies that provided evidence for that method.
In one 2010 study cited in the new paper, Japanese researchers found that 78 percent of people trying to taper off Paxil suffered severe withdrawal symptoms. The research team had them taper much more slowly, over an average of nine months and for as long as four years. With this regimen, only 6 percent of subjects experienced withdrawal.
In another study, Dutch researchers in 2018 found that 70 percent of people who'd had trouble giving up Paxil or Effexor quit their prescriptions safely by following an extended tapering regimen, reducing their dosage by smaller and smaller increments, down to one-fortieth of the original amount. This is the regimen recommended in the new paper.
Dr. Horowitz and Dr. Taylor also cited brain-imaging evidence. Antidepressants such as Paxil, Zoloft and Effexor work in part by blocking the serotonin transporter, a molecule that works in the synapses between brain cells to clear out the chemical serotonin, which is thought to help impart a sense of well-being in some people. By blocking the transporter, antidepressants prolong and enhance serotonin's effects.
But the brain-imaging studies found that inhibition of the transporter increases sharply with addition of the drug and, by extension, also drops sharply with any reduction in dosage. The standard medical advice, to reduce dosage by half -- for instance, by taking a pill every other day -- and end medication entirely after four weeks, does not take this into account, the two researchers argued.
"Doctors have in mind that these drugs act in a linear way, that when you reduce dosage by half, it reduces the effect in the brain by a half," Dr. Horowitz said. "It doesn't work that way. And as a result, there's a huge load in terms of the effect on brain receptors, and patients are being advised to come off way too quickly."
Laura Delano, executive director of Inner Compass Initiative, a nonprofit organization that runs The Withdrawal Project and focuses on helping people learn about safer psychiatric drug tapering, said: "I didn't know about the benefits of slow tapering when I came off five meds in five months, and had a very difficult time in withdrawal."
The new paper, she added, "speaks to how hard it is to get this information into the clinical world. We laypeople have been saying this for a long time, and it's telling that it took psychiatrists coming off meds themselves for this information to finally be heard."
Dr. Horowitz and Dr. Taylor called for more, and more careful, research to be done on withdrawal, to bring their field up to speed, and to develop withdrawal strategies tailored to individual patients and individual drugs.
"I think psychiatrists are taught to learn things from textbooks and from well-conducted studies," Dr. Horowitz said. "We don't have many of those for withdrawal, so it makes it hard to believe it's real. And psychiatrists spend a lot more time prescribing things than stopping them."
Correction: March 8, 2019, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the professions of researchers who studied depression treatments. Mark Horowitz and David Taylor are psychiatric researchers, not psychiatrists. The article also misstated Dr. Horowitz's affiliation. He works at University College London, not King's College London. Finally, the article misstated the journal in which their paper was published. It was the Lancet Psychiatry, not the Lancet.

American Century over for good?

Texto completo: "Politics stops at the water's edge" was a tradition that, not so long ago, was observed by both parties, particularly when a president was abroad, speaking for the nation.
The tradition was enunciated by Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan in 1947, as many of the Republicans in the 80th Congress moved to back Truman's leadership in the Cold War against Stalin's empire.
The tradition lasted until the mid-1960s, when the left wing of the Democratic Party turned viscerally, and even violently, against the war in Vietnam and President Lyndon Johnson.
Republican Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush I, with the support of conservative Democrats, led America to final victory in the Cold War
Yet except for brief intervals, like the rallying around George H.W. Bush after the triumphant Gulf War of
1991 and George W. Bush after 9/11, true national unity has never been restored.
Were proof needed, last week provided it.
President Trump flew to Hanoi, Vietnam, to meet North Korea's dictator. Subject of negotiations: Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons, including his missiles that may be able to reach our homeland.
How did the Democratic Party wish the commander in chief well on his mission for America?
During his first full day in Hanoi, a committee of Nancy Pelosi's House held a public hearing featuring ex-Trump lawyer and "fixer" Michael Cohen, a convicted perjurer and felon who cut a deal with the prosecution for a reduced sentence.
The city loved it. Cable and network TV coverage went gavel to gavel. Cohen's testimony crowded out the Trump-Kim summit and even news of aerial clashes between India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers that have fought three wars since independence, 70 years ago.
What were the headlines Trump came home to after refusing to lift sanctions on North Korea, in return for meager concessions Kim offered?
"Cohen Paints Trump as Crooked" was the banner atop page one of The Washington Post. Cohen's depiction of his old boss was boldly quoted above: "He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat."
"Cohen Accuses Trump of Lies and Cover-ups" ran the page-one headline in The New York Times.
"Cohen Declares Trump a Racist, Cheat and Conman" read the huge headline in the Financial Times.
Indulging its hatred of Trump is a preoccupation, an obsession of this capital city. Those headlines reveal not only the news judgment of the editors but the agenda of the elite who turn to them first every morning.
That agenda is the breaking of this president; his disgrace and fall; and, if impeachment proves not possible, his crushing defeat in 2020 and subsequent indictment. Our so-called Dreamers in Washington, D.C., look to the triumphal return to power of the establishment the American people threw out in 2016.
In the play unfolding,
Cohen's testimony to the House committee was scene one of act one.
Next comes the Mueller report, though it appears Robert Mueller and his team, after investigating for two years, have found no collusion between Trump and Vladimir Putin in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.
Hence, the hopes of Trump haters are being redirected to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Subjects of investigation: the Trump Organization, the Trump Inaugural Committee, the Trump Foundation, the Trump family and any entity with which Trump has been associated in
40 years.
As the president is chief of state and head of government, he cannot be indicted. He must first be removed from the presidency. But to remove him, Democrats have to impeach him in the House and convict him in a Republican Senate.
If they cannot, they will have to defeat him at the polls.
Today, a watching world is asking: If you Americans are at war with yourselves over race, religion, morality, culture and politics, if you cannot unite yourselves, how can you unite the world? And around what?
Maybe the American Century is really over.

Move abroad for health care?

Texto completo: NerdWallet
The notion that health care outside the U.S. could be good as well as cheap is a foreign one to many Americans.
Kathleen Peddicord frequently hears from such skeptics as founder of Live and Invest Overseas, a site for people curious about living abroad. Actual expats like her, however, tell of good-quality care at a fraction of the U.S. price. Treatment for a motorbike accident in Panama cost her $20. Emergency dental surgery that might cost $10,000 or more in the U.S. was $4,500 in Paris. In many countries, medications that would require a prescription in the States are available directly from licensed pharmacies at low prices, thanks to government subsidies or regulation.
“The health care in a lot of places around the world is very good, as good as in the United States,” said Peddicord, who currently divides her time between Paris and Panama. “Some places, it is better.”
Low-cost, quality health care usually isn’t the main reason people move abroad, said expat and Mexico resident Don Murray, who writes for rival site International Living. But reduced medical expenses are part of the lower living costs that prompt many Americans to relocate, he said.
Expat numbers are on the rise
About 9 million Americans who aren’t in the military live outside the U.S., according to State Department estimates. That’s increased considerably from its 1999 estimate of 3 million to 6 million. The number could rise in coming years as millions more Americans barrel toward retirement without enough income to maintain their standard of living at home.
Health care is a particular concern for Americans who want to retire before age 65, when Medicare, the government health program for seniors, kicks in. Currently, early retirees can buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but it’s not always truly affordable and its future is uncertain.
Some who would otherwise retire plan to keep working, rather than risk being uninsured. But a move abroad could be an option for those intrepid enough to try it.
Cheaper health care also may appeal to gig economy workers who aren’t tied to stateside jobs. Freelance science writer Erica Rex, for example, recently wrote an opinion column for The New York Times about moving to the United Kingdom and then France after her 2009 cancer diagnosis. “Moving to Europe was a choice weighed against other, grimmer options for health care, which included the strong possibility of being bankrupted by cancer treatment and winding up at the mercy of New York State’s welfare system,” she wrote.
Health care quality varies by destination
Not all expat havens have great health care systems. Belize, for example, encourages immigration by exempting retirees from most income taxes — but many expats there cross the border to Mexico for health care, Peddicord said.
France, on the other hand, is known for its excellent health care system. International Living and Live and Invest Overseas give the country top marks, along with Mexico, Ecuador and Malaysia. International Living also praised Thailand and Costa Rica, while Live and Invest Overseas said Portugal, Italy and Malta have admirable health care.
With any country, quality can vary — especially in sparsely populated areas. Murray and his wife, Diane, left their first retirement destination, a small town in Ecuador, after encountering broken equipment and few doctors. They’re much happier with the care near their Yucatan Peninsula home, where next-day appointments are the norm and doctors are typically trained in the U.S. or Europe, he said.
“It’s like in the U.S. — if you live in Possum Belly, Ala., and they don’t have a hospital and the nearest one is an hour and a half away, the health care isn’t going to be the same” as in a major city, Murray said.
Options for health care access
Expats may be able to qualify for a country’s public health care system if they become residents. Otherwise, there’s typically a private system in which people can pay out of pocket and get reimbursed if they have private health insurance.
Peddicord and her husband, Lief Simon, who are in their 50s, have an international health insurance policy that covers them whether they’re traveling or at home in France or Panama. The annual cost is about $3,000 for both of them, she said. Murray, 69, said he and his wife pay about $80 each month for Mexico’s public health system, but use private doctors and pay out of pocket for most care (including $8 for a recent hospital visit to treat an eye infection).
“My personal budget no longer contains a line for health care expenses,” Murray said. “They are so inconsequential there is no need.”

Texto completo: Q: When I was watching a show for one hour recently, it was interrupted two times with a banner across the bottom of the screen advertising future shows. Is there anyone I can complain to about this? It'll be in the middle of a serious scene when the banner comes and is very distracting.
A: What you encountered is called a snipe, an onscreen promotion for an upcoming show, and we're long past the point of complaining them away.
As the New York Times reported in 2007, they are a way "to cram promotions onto television screens in the age of channel surfing, ad skipping and screen-based multitasking." In other words, you can't get away from these when you might fast-forward through a promotional spot during an ad break (and the snipes mean valuable ad time isn't wasted on promos during the breaks). The Times said snipes are also different from bugs, "those network logos that pop up in screen corners during shows," and are successors to the decades-old, nonstop information crawls on the bottom of the screen during sports and news programs.
Even in 2007, snipes and such were being shrugged off by the TV industry as "the way of the world." And as annoying as they are – making your TV look more like a cluttered computer screen – executives told the Times that "the trend toward busy screens is an attempt to cater to the tastes and habits of younger viewers, who reflexively toggle among screens, online and on cellphones."
Q: A while ago there was a program about a family that owned a bar. The father (I can't remember his name, but a well-known actor) was Caucasian. The mother was Asian and bitingly funny. I can't remember the name of the show. Any possibility it will be shown in reruns or remade?
A: The show was called "Sullivan & Son." It originally aired on TBS from 2012 to 2014. Dan Lauria was the dad, Jodi Long the mom and Steve Byrne their son. I do not know of plans for a reboot, or an authorized release on disc, and a check of the usual suspects did not find broadcasts of reruns. You can find old episodes on YouTube (this show comes with a fee to watch), Vudu (ditto) and Google Play (double ditto).
Q: Is "iZombie" returning?
A: It will begin its fifth and final season on The CW on May 2. If you need to catch up, possibilities include the first three seasons on disc (I don't know when the fourth will be) and the four seasons so far on Netflix.

Texto completo: ALBANY – For Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top state lawmakers, taking a stance in favor of legalizing marijuana for adult use was the easy part.
Figuring out how to divvy up the tax revenue marijuana will bring in?
That's the hard part.
Cuomo and legislative leaders still speak of legal, recreational marijuana as an inevitability in New York, though they have all signaled a new law may have to wait until the state budget is approved later this month.
But deciding what to do with a potential infusion of marijuana tax revenue remains a key sticking point, which was reinvigorated Tuesday when Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio came out in favor of saving a slice for the New York City subway system.
Cuomo's office estimates legal marijuana would bring in $300 million a year to the state's coffers when it is fully up and running, which likely wouldn't happen before 2021.
"It's easier said than done," Cuomo said Thursday on WAMC-FM in Albany. "The devil's in the details, and you have to do it with safeguards and protections."
How much to tax? The first step is figuring out how much to tax.
Set the rate too low and states risk losing out on much-needed revenue. Set it too high and they risk driving marijuana users to the black market, where the product could be cheaper.
As such, the tax rates fluctuate wildly – from 10 percent plus sales tax in Michigan to 37 percent in Washington state, the highest rate in the nation.
Some states also charge their normal sales tax; others don't.
Massachusetts charges 17 percent in excise and sales taxes, plus local governments have the option to tack on a tax of up to 3 percent.
Cuomo's plan: 22 percent Cuomo's proposal, which he unveiled in January, calls for three separate taxes.
The first tax would be on marijuana growers: $1 per dry-weight gram of cannabis flower plus 25 cents per dry-weight gram of cannabis trim.
Then there is a 20 percent state tax on marijuana when it's sold from a wholesaler to a retailer. If the wholesaler is also the retailer, then the retail customer pays it directly at the time of sale.
The third tax: 2 percent that goes to the county where the retail dispensary is located.
All told, it would be a 22 percent tax on top of the per-gram taxes on marijuana growers. Sales tax wouldn't apply.
A pair of key Democratic state lawmakers, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal-Peoples Stokes of Buffalo and Sen. Liz Krueger of Manhattan, have their own proposal, too.
It ultimately ends up in a similar place: a 15 percent excise tax plus the existing 4 percent state sales tax and a per-gram tax on growers. Local governments would be able to charge up to 2 percent.
Where they differ Where Cuomo and the key lawmakers differ is how they would split up the revenue.
Peoples-Stokes and Heastie have repeatedly said the bulk of the money should go toward communities that have been hit hard by strict drug laws over the years.
Across the state and nationwide, black and Hispanic people have been far more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.
It has been particularly pronounced in New York City, where black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate white people were from 2015 through 2017, according to The New York Times.
Peoples-Stokes and Krueger's bill would take about half of the marijuana revenue and put it toward grants for "community-based nonprofits."
Those grants would have to go toward job training, mental-health treatment, adult education or other support services in communities that were "disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies."
About a quarter of the revenue would go into the state lottery fund, which distributes money for education. And the remaining quarter would be put toward funding public-education programs about drug use and addiction.
"When it comes to marijuana, and I've been clear to the governor and the mayor, is the first commitment from those revenues should be really toward community investments, particularly to those communities that have been impacted by the criminal justice issues," Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, told reporters Tuesday.
Weed for rails? Cuomo's original proposal is less specific, saying the revenue would go toward things such as administering the marijuana program, improving traffic safety, small business loans and public-health education.
But his plan would essentially give the governor's office total control over how the money is spent – something lawmakers often fight against.
On Tuesday, Cuomo unveiled a new plan: He and de Blasio want to keep a piece of marijuana revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the beleaguered New York City transit system.
It's an idea first floated three months ago by transit advocates and some city officials, including then-Public Advocate candidate Melissa Mark-Viverito, who dubbed it the "Weed for Rails" plan.
Cuomo and de Blasio didn't say how much they want to keep for the MTA, and Cuomo's office later clarified that the money would come from marijuana sales in New York City, not the entire state.
Senate Minority Leader John Flanagan, R-Suffolk County, said the idea is ridiculous.
"This is nuts," Flanagan said. "The notion that we would legalize recreational marijuana and hope and pray that somehow a lot of people will smoke so we can have good buses and subway cars, that's ludicrous."
Local governments looking for more Local governments, meanwhile, are looking for a bigger cut of the revenue pie.
Counties say the local tax should be 4 percent — the same as the current county-level sales tax in most parts of the state.
Stephen Acquario, executive director of the state Association of Counties, said 2 percent doesn't cut it, particularly when counties and municipalities will have to respond to any on-the-ground issues marijuana legalization brings.
"Only with sufficient funding will local governments be able to work in partnership with the state to oversee public health, public safety, criminal justice, consumer protection and economic development," he said in a statement.
The New York Conference of Mayors, which represents cities and villages across the state, held a series of panel discussions on Wednesday in Albany to examine marijuana legalization and what they can do to prepare.
Pushing lawmakers and Cuomo for more local revenue was a common theme.
"I do think we should be very mindful of how the legislation will impact revenue sharing," said Susan Sommer, general counsel for the NYC Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice.
"There should be enough coming to local governments to ensure we can do what we know to be the right things for our communities."

Quality healthcare on the rise

Texto completo: NerdWallet
The notion that health care outside the U.S. could be good as well as cheap is a foreign one to many Americans.
Kathleen Peddicord frequently hears from such skeptics as founder of Live and Invest Overseas, a site for people curious about living abroad. Actual expats like her, however, tell of good-quality care at a fraction of the U.S. price. Treatment for a motorbike accident in Panama cost her $20. Emergency dental surgery that might cost $10,000 or more in the U.S. was $4,500 in Paris. In many countries, medications that would require a prescription in the States are available directly from licensed pharmacies at low prices, thanks to government subsidies or regulation.
“The health care in a lot of places around the world is very good, as good as in the United States,” says Peddicord, who currently divides her time between Paris and Panama. “Some places, it is better.”
Low-cost, quality health care usually isn't the main reason people move abroad, says expat and Mexico resident Don Murray, who writes for rival site International Living. But reduced medical expenses are part of the lower living costs that prompt many Americans to relocate, he says.
Expat numbers are on the rise
About 9 million Americans who aren't in the military live outside the U.S., according to State Department estimates. That's increased considerably from its 1999 estimate of 3 million to 6 million. The number could rise in coming years as millions more Americans barrel toward retirement without enough income to maintain their standard of living at home.
Health care is a particular concern for Americans who want to retire before age 65, when Medicare, the government health program for seniors, kicks in. Currently, early retirees can buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but it's not always truly affordable and its future is uncertain.
Some who would otherwise retire plan to keep working, rather than risk being uninsured. But a move abroad could be an option for those intrepid enough to try it.
Cheaper health care also may appeal to gig economy workers who aren't tied to stateside jobs. Freelance science writer Erica Rex, for example, recently wrote an opinion column for The New York Times about moving to the United Kingdom and then France after her 2009 cancer diagnosis. “Moving to Europe was a choice weighed against other, grimmer options for health care, which included the strong possibility of being bankrupted by cancer treatment and winding up at the mercy of New York State's welfare system,” she wrote.
Health care quality varies by destination
Not all expat havens have great health care systems. Belize, for example, encourages immigration by exempting retirees from most income taxes – but many expats there cross the border to Mexico for health care, Peddicord says.
France, on the other hand, is known for its excellent health care system. International Living and Live and Invest Overseas give the country top marks, along with Mexico, Ecuador and Malaysia. International Living praises Thailand and Costa Rica as well, while Live and Invest Overseas says Portugal, Italy and Malta have admirable health care.
With any country, quality can vary – especially in sparsely populated areas. Murray and his wife, Diane, left their first retirement destination, a small town in Ecuador, after encountering broken equipment and few doctors. They're much happier with the care near their Yucatan Peninsula home, where next-day appointments are the norm and doctors are typically trained in the U.S. or Europe, he says.
“It's like in the U.S. – if you live in Possum Belly, Ala., and they don't have a hospital and the nearest one is an hour and a half away, the health care isn't going to be the same” as in a major city, Murray says.
Options for health care access
Expats may be able to qualify for a country's public health care system if they become residents. Otherwise, there's typically a private system in which people can pay out of pocket and get reimbursed if they have private health insurance.
Peddicord and her husband, Lief Simon, who are in their 50s, have an international health insurance policy that covers them whether they're traveling or at home in France or Panama. The annual cost is about $3,000 for both of them, she says. Murray, 69, says he and his wife pay about $80 each month for Mexico's public health system, but use private doctors and pay out of pocket for most care (including $8 for a recent hospital visit to treat an eye infection).
“My personal budget no longer contains a line for health care expenses,” Murray says. “They are so inconsequential there is no need.”

The Last Temptation of Michael Cohen

Texto completo: This week, the son of a Holocaust survivor sat before Congress and testified about how he had helped install a white supremacist “autocrat" as President of the United States.
Nothing better illustrates the liminal position in which American Jews find ourselves now.
We have witnessed a powerful resurgence of anti-Semitism that has infiltrated both places of power and the public square. We've seen it marching through the streets of Charlottesville, slaughtering 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, and snaking from the mouths of politicians and elected officials in the current administration.
Yet even as white nationalists wish us dead, a shocking number of Jews have become willing collaborators in white supremacy — not only public bigots such as Ben Shapiro and David Horowitz, but kapos in the openly ethnonationalist Trump regime, such as Stephen Miller or Jared Kushner.
Thus we are capable of being both the target of racism and a part of its apparatus.
That could not be clearer than in the tragic figure of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer.
In his opening statement to the House Advisory Committee this week, Cohen made a point of mentioning that his father, Maurice, had survived a concentration camp before immigrating to the United States. Cohen went on to describe, with understandable irony, the decades he spent enabling the rise of a “racist" — Cohen's word — who used xenophobia to consolidate his power, and tore apart families to put children of immigrants seeking asylum into camps.
“I let you down," he said, addressing his father.
Maybe he was talking to all of us.
On the stand, Cohen wasn't the sad-sack schmendrick we expected from his perp walk photos. Instead he was uncomfortably familiar — another striver hungering for power, money, and affirmation.
And something more: survival.
Cohen grew up knowing, better than most — better than the many American Jews who experienced the Holocaust at a further remove — that white supremacy could turn on us at any moment. “Wherever we go, Jews are like guppies swimming in an ocean filled with sharks," the writer Peter Trachtenberg put it: “Or with big, unidentified fish that may turn out to be sharks, we're never sure."
In his life, Cohen chose one of the oldest minority survival tactics — assimilation into white supremacy and its agendas. The essence of this strategy is collaboration, capitulation, and cowardice. It's the hope that when they're rounding people up, they'll come for someone else first, and maybe never get around to you and yours. Maybe you can even slow that progress by rounding people up yourself.
In doing so, Cohen was following in the footsteps of Roy Cohn, Trump's old mentor. Cohn had been Joseph McCarthy's right hand in the Red Scare witch hunt of the 1950s, the lawyer who helped send Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to the electric chair, a gay Jew who sold out Jews and homosexuals without a second thought.
Like Cohn, Cohen was willing to cozy up to the racism of those he sought to serve. Growing up on Long Island, Cohen had been a Trump stan since high school. Trump's bigotry was already obvious then — it runs all the way back to the 1970s when the Department of Justice took him and his father to court for discrimination. Perhaps that very bigotry was part of Trump's allure for Cohen.
In 2001, Cohen began investing in Trump properties and convinced his own family members to do so too — literally buying his way into Trump's regard. By 2011, Cohen — who at 22 had volunteered on Mike Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign — was an executive in the Trump Organization and had become known as Trump's “pit bull." It was actually Cohen's idea, that year, to start exploring the possibility of a Trump presidential run.
Cohen continued to cover for Trump — even assembling a “diversity coalition" to give his boss's xenophobia plausible deniability — right up until the end.
But just as Trump dropped Roy Cohn when Cohn got AIDS (“Donald pisses icewater," was Cohn's judgement on his former protegé), he had no compunctions about treating his new fixer with contempt, barking at him in front of others, and playing him off against other retainers. Rather than a pit bull, the New York Times called Cohen Trump's punching bag.
On June 20 — six weeks after the FBI raided his office, and five days after Trump publicly disowned him, refusing to pay his legal fees — Cohen began to display something like a conscience.
He resigned as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, reportedly citing a conversation with his father as a turning point. Maurice Cohen reportedly told his son that he hadn't survived the Holocaust just to see the family name “sullied" by Trump.
“As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor," Cohen wrote in his resignation letter, “the images and sounds of [Trump's] family separation policy is [sic] heart wrenching."
On Monday, when Cohen used the national spotlight to address the president directly, he sounded like a new man: “You don't separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life," Cohen said. “You don't vilify people based on the God they pray to."
He continued, “To those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did, I pray the country doesn't make the same mistakes I have made, or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying."
He could easily have been addressing his fellow Jews.
Cohen's collaboration with a racist regime was simply a more extreme version of the same deal so many light-skinned Jews make with white supremacy.
Even those of us who consider ourselves liberal or progressive can be deeply ambivalent about the conditional whiteness bestowed upon us in the United States over the past 60 years. We work in the all-white office and we never point out that it's all white. We move our children to a whiter school — not because we care about race, we say, but because education is so important. We laugh at the racist joke. We hedge our bets. White supremacy is a protection racket; it offers security on one hand and a lethal threat on the other.
Other minorities make this bargain too, sometimes — look at Ben Carson and Clarence Thomas — but Jews more easily succumb because so many of us easily pass as white.
Note that this strategy has never worked for us. It didn't protect us in Spain, or England, or France, or Germany. There's no reason to think it will work now.
And it certainly did not work for Cohen.
At the heart of this moment is the question of how we survive as a minority population. As history curves in on itself, as fascism repeats itself, we have only one advantage: unlike other places where ethnonationalism has flourished, the US is fast approaching a plurality of minorities. Coalition is white supremacy's worst nightmare — that's why so many white supremacists are fighting so hard against it. Look no further than former Republican Maine governor (and proto-Trump) Paul LePage, who the day after Cohen's testimony publicly defended the electoral college on the basis that it keeps minorities from having an equal vote.
A rising tide of racism drowns us all. White supremacist fears of a majority-minority nation don't target any one group alone — they are interconnected, as we saw when anti-immigrant xenophobia fueled the killings of Jews in Pittsburgh.
If Jews are going to survive the future, we will have to stand with people of color for our mutual benefit.
In the final moments of Wednesday's hearing, Representative Elijah Cummings — the black son of sharecroppers — preached a sermon of redemption.
“I don't know why this is happening for you," he told Cohen. “But it's my hope that a small part of it is for our country to be better."
Standing before him, Cohen wept.

Texto completo: The composer Vivian Fine wrote acclaimed dance scores for Martha Graham and José Limón; brash, skillfully constructed orchestral pieces; and a raft of unusual chamber works.
And if you've never heard of her, you're not alone.
Fine, who died in 2000, is among a sizable group of American composers from the middle of the 20th century who remain inexplicably overlooked today. Consider this: Though Fine taught for years at the Juilliard School and New York University, the New York Philharmonic has never performed her music.
What explains this neglect? It might be collateral damage from a period when American composers squared off in opposing stylistic camps.
On one side were those whose complex modernist languages involved various atonal and serial methods. On the other were self-described "postmodern" composers, who experimented with minimalism and found common ground with rock, jazz and ethnic music.
As the polemics raged on, a large number of composers -- including Fine, Walter Piston, Vincent Persichetti, Roy Harris, Harold Shapero and others -- occupied a kind of neo-Classical middle ground. They continued using essentially tonal languages and tried to reinvigorate classical forms with fresh harmonic and rhythmic techniques. But they were perceived, especially by serialists based in universities who claimed the intellectual high ground, as dated and irrelevant.
Many of these composers, though, brought well-honed skills, artistic integrity and a touch of American feistiness to their music. Conductors like Leonard Slatkin, Gerard Schwarz, Marin Alsop and others have tried to bring attention to them, to little avail.
Last month Leon Botstein, who has tirelessly worked to bring to light worthy scores by neglected composers, led his American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in the New York premiere of Fine's Concertante for Piano and Orchestra (1944), with the accomplished pianist Charlie Albright as soloist, part of a program devoted to overlooked mid-20th-century American works. I knew some of Fine's works, but not this bracing 17-minute piece in two movements.
Vivian Fine: Concertante for Piano and Orchestra (1944)
Though in her early years, Fine composed in a dissonance-saturated language of hard-edged contours and jagged counterpoint, she mellowed as she matured. This piece, an outlier, adopts a deliberately neo-Classical, almost neo-Baroque idiom and abounds in contrasts: Lacy, lyrical passages for piano often lead to stretches of tangled, industrious counterpoint; warm, rich string sonorities segue into flinty, brassy harmonies.
The restless, spirited second movement is intoxicating. I especially love the moody first movement, especially a pensive, near-atonal episode about six minutes in.
Walter Piston: Concerto for Viola and Orchestra (1957)
For more than 30 years, Piston was a respected music professor at Harvard. He literally wrote the book on harmony, a textbook still in use today. Yet his music came to be perceived, unfairly, as well made but a little, well, professorial. This great 25-minute viola concerto is just one of many Piston scores that should enter the repertory. During a meditative opening episode, the viola wanders lyrically atop clear-textured modal harmonies, until the music presses the opening melodic motif into service as a building block for the animated main section, rich with intricate interplay between soloist and orchestra.
Amid brass fanfares, the finale takes off like some frenetic rondo, though metric dislocations and out-of-nowhere restrained passages keep you off guard. The slow middle movement is the most beguiling, a neo-Romantic Adagio with an intensely soulful viola theme cushioned by soft, wistful strings. This concerto could fill the slot on orchestra programs that typically goes to Mozart or Beethoven. Piston's piece occupies a 1950s American version of the same neighborhood.
Harold Shapero: Symphony for Classical Orchestra (1947)
In 1948, Aaron Copland wrote of his younger colleague Shapero that "few musicians of our time put their pieces together with greater security," adding that Shapero's technical adroitness serves "a wonderfully spontaneous musical gift." No work exemplifies this more than his 45-minute Symphony for Classical Orchestra.
Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere in 1948 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1953, he also led a recording, made on a single, hectic day while he was suffering from a fever. Though a little shaky, the recorded performance is exhilarating. Beethoven's Seventh, slyly quoted at one point, was a model for Shapero's piece, which opens with an elusive Adagio, all flickering chords and sustained sonorities, that shifts into a bustling, densely contrapuntal Allegro.
A tenderly lyrical yet quizzical slow movement leads to a misbehaving scherzo, and then a herculean finale. André Previn had a triumph with the piece at the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the late 1980s and later recorded it. Though Mr. Botstein led a performance in 2016, this demanding piece mostly languishes today. American orchestras planning yet another run-through of Beethoven's Seventh might instead take a crack as Shapero's masterpiece.
Norman Dello Joio: Meditations on Ecclesiastes for String Orchestra (1956)
Dello Joio, born in New York, probably thought the future of this piece was assured when it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1957. Alas, it's all but disappeared. I last heard it performed by the Boston University Symphony Orchestra in the late 1970s.
The string writing somehow remains shimmering and transparent even when sonorities turn thick and textures gnarly. The interplay between darkly contemplative music, as in the piercing "To everything there is a season" opening movement, and quixotic episodes, like the spirited "...and a time to dance and to laugh...," is so deftly handled you hang on every shift.
Irving Fine: Symphony (1962)
Of late, there has been a welcome renewal of interest in the Boston-born Irving Fine (no relation to Vivian). A splendid 2015 recording by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project drew fresh attention to his works. The album opens with his first completed orchestra score, the ebullient and impish Toccata Concertante (1947), a piece that could become a surefire concert opener for orchestras.
His later, skittish, tartly modernist scores skillfully combine neo-Classical structures with a vigorous but free use of 12-tone techniques, as in the final movement of his 1962 Symphony, generally considered Fine's major statement. He led a performance of the symphony at Tanglewood in 1962 just days before his death at 47.
Samuel Barber: Piano Concerto (1962)
Yes, I know: Barber is hardly neglected. His Adagio for Strings is world-famous. But why is his darkly neo-Romantic and teeming Piano Concerto almost never performed these days? At its 1962 premiere by the Boston Symphony, with John Browning as soloist, which helped inaugurate what was then called Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, the piece "made a decided hit with the audience," Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times reported, adding that it may be that Barber "has supplied a repertory piece." Listen, and you'll hear why. It ends with a demonic finale, full of pummeling chords and frenetic energy.
Virgil Thomson: Symphony on a Hymn Tune (1928)
Though Thomson completed this piece in 1928, it did not have its official premiere until 1945, when he conducted it with the New York Philharmonic. The piece can seem a dizzying assemblage built from distinctive musical chunks: evocations of old-time hymn-singing; a kind of spare, modal melodic writing that Thomson called his "Missouri plainchant" style; fractured fanfares and down-home-marches; faux-serious bursts of counterpoint.
The musical language can be unabashedly brash and dissonant one moment, defiantly diatonic the next. Yet in a good performance it comes across as an inspired, if iconoclastic, entity, and somehow exuberantly "American" -- whatever that means. No surprise: Mr. Botstein led the last performance I know of in New York, which was recorded live. May he keep up the fight for neglected 20th-century Americans.

Texto completo: His casual cruelty toward Puerto Rico echoes the long history of American colonialism, writes historian
It's been 17 months since Hurricanes Maria and Irma tore through Puerto Rico, but the wounds are still fresh. It took nearly a year for full power to be restored. Even now, blue tarp fills in for roofs, as Puerto Ricans await federal funding.
They have reason to wonder how much will come. According to reporting from The Washington Post, President Trump has privately insisted to John Kelly and Mick Mulvaney that not one dollar of disaster aid go to Puerto Rico. His administration has publicly opposed the extension of additional nutrition assistance funds to the island, deeming them "excessive and unnecessary." When he speaks of Puerto Rico, Trump has a noticeable habit of addressing it in the second person. "I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget out of whack," he scolded after Hurricane Maria.
I hate to tell you , but you've thrown our budget out of whack.
Puerto Rico isn't a foreign country. It's the United States, and its inhabitants have been citizens for more than a century. That's because the United States extends far beyond its North American mainland. It includes the overseas territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas, Guam and American Samoa. More than 3 million people live in those territories - more than 1 percent of the U.S. population.
Yet the true shape of the country appears to elude the present administration, which is obsessed with building a wall at the border of the contiguous United States to "protect our homeland," as Trump puts it. When a judge in Hawaii's U.S. District Court blocked Trump's travel ban, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions reported being "amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president."
In neglecting the overseas parts of the country, the administration is carrying forward an attitude rooted in the long history of U.S. colonialism - a belief that some parts of the country matter and others don't.
This us/them distinction, which tracks closely with race, has been central to Washington's handling of its overseas possessions for generations. Woodrow Wilson, speaking of the territories, declared in 1913 that they stood "outside the charmed circle of our own national life." As a Supreme Court justice put it in 1901, in a notoriously convoluted phrase, they were "foreign to the United States in a domestic sense." A part of the country, yet apart from the country. Even today, the territories can't vote for president, can't meaningfully vote in Congress and aren't fully covered by the Constitution.
Historically, this exclusion has mattered tremendously. In the 1930s, it led Washington to invest little in fortifying its Pacific territories, despite the clear possibility that Japan might attack them. In December 1941, Japan did attack, striking Hawaii but also - as fewer know - the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island, all within a matter of hours. In the first draft of his Pearl Harbor address, Franklin Roosevelt planned to speak prominently of the attack on the Philippines as well as that on Hawaii, but he later crossed out that reference and focused his speech on Hawaii only. Weak defenses allowed Japan to conquer the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island in weeks. It took the western tip of Alaska, too. The U.S. military, to clear the war zone, evacuated the Aleutian Islands and interned their Native inhabitants for years.
On the mainland, this crisis slipped easily from view. Rand McNally atlases at the time listed territories that were bona fide U.S. soil as "foreign." Few U.S. maps included the territories (as few do today). "Most people in this country, including educated people, know little or nothing about our overseas possessions," a governmental report during the war concluded. "As a matter of fact, a lot of people do not know that we have overseas possessions."
Japanese occupation and the subsequent fight by the U.S. military to reclaim the territories were lethal. Manila, then the sixth-largest city in the United States, was devastated in the war. And many of the lives lost there - 100,000 is a common estimate - were claimed by friendly fire. "It was United States bombs and shells that did most of the damage," reported the New York Times. In all, the war probably killed more than 1.5 million in the U.S. territories. More than 1 million, mostly Filipinos, were U.S. nationals.
World War II in the Philippines was the bloodiest event ever to take place on U.S. soil, killing twice as many as the Civil War. And yet it plays little part in national memory. Even Richard Nixon, who served in the Pacific during the war, believed Pearl Harbor to be "the only piece of American territory that suffered directly from enemy attack in World War II."
Mainland ignorance of the territories mattered during wars, but it mattered in peacetime, too. In the 1930s, a doctor named Cornelius Rhoads traveled to San Juan to study anemia. He took Puerto Rico's subordinate status as license to practice medicine recklessly. He refused treatment to some of his patients, whom he called "experimental 'animals.'" He tried to induce diseases in others by restricting their diets.
Rhoads penned a letter to a Boston colleague. Puerto Ricans, he wrote, were the "dirtiest, laziest, most degenerate and thievish" people on Earth. His fellow doctors took "delight in the abuse and torture of the unfortunate subjects." Opining that what the island needed was "something to totally exterminate the population," he confided to his colleague that he had done his best to "further the process of extermination" by killing eight of his patients and trying to transfer cancer into others.
Rhoads's letter was discovered before he sent it, and it became a scandal on the island. Rhoads protested that he'd been joking, and it is genuinely unclear whether he killed anyone. Nonetheless, Rhoads suffered virtually no consequences. He fled to the mainland, faced no hearings, kept his job and within a few years was elected vice president of the New York Academy of Medicine. In 1949, he made the cover of Time magazine, celebrated as a hero for his contributions to medicine.
The following year, nationalists led a seven-city uprising in Puerto Rico. While it was underway, two made their way to Washington to try to kill Harry Truman. They came shockingly close, and Truman named his near-assassination as a reason for declining to seek reelection.
What motivated the assassins? One, Oscar Collazo, spoke bitterly of how Rhoads had never faced trial. The shooting, he explained, was designed to draw attention to Puerto Rico's plight. "How little the American people know of Puerto Rico!" Collazo exclaimed. "They don't know Puerto Rico is a possession of the United States."
That was 1950. Yet even now, with Puerto Rico entering its 120th year as a U.S. territory, it remains obscure to mainlanders. A poll conducted after Hurricane Maria showed that only a slight majority knew Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens and that only 37 percent of adults under 30 did.
Puerto Rico isn't the only territory to have courted peril in the past two years. Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last October, Typhoon Yutu became the strongest storm to hit the United States since the 1930s. It plowed into Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas, though it barely made a dent in the national news. And North Korea has threatened to create an "enveloping fire" around Guam. Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas, Guam - those are four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Each has faced a recent existential threat.
This will probably continue. As global warming worsens and U.S. alliances fray, the most endangered parts of the United States will be those beyond North America - and unprotected by any wall.
Trump has recently considered using funds reserved for Puerto Rican aid to pay for his border wall. Doing so would be a disaster for the millions of U.S. citizens on the island. And it would be a painful confirmation of where the "homeland" really is.

Another pot debate: How to tax product

Texto completo: ALBANY – For Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top state lawmakers, taking a stance in favor of legalizing marijuana for adult use was the easy part.
Figuring out how to divvy up the tax revenue marijuana will bring in? That's the hard part.
Cuomo and legislative leaders still speak of legal, recreational marijuana as an inevitability in New York, though they have all signaled a new law may have to wait until the state budget is approved later this month.
But deciding what to do with a potential infusion of marijuana tax revenue remains a key sticking point, which was reinvigorated Tuesday when Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio came out in favor of saving a slice for the New York City subway system.
Cuomo's office estimates legal marijuana would bring in $300 million a year to the state's coffers when it is fully up and running, which likely wouldn't happen before 2021.
"It's easier said than done," Cuomo said Thursday on WAMC-FM in Albany. "The devil's in the details, and you have to do it with safeguards and protections."
How much to tax? The first step is figuring out how much to tax.
Across the country, states that have already legalized marijuana have struggled with the delicate balancing act of setting an acceptable tax rate.
Set the rate too low, and states risk losing out on much-needed revenue. Set it too high, and they risk driving marijuana users to the black market, where the product could be cheaper.
As such, the tax rates fluctuate wildly: From 10 percent plus sales tax in Michigan to 37 percent in Washington state, the highest rate in the nation.
Some states also charge their normal sales tax; others don't.
In neighboring Massachusetts, the state charges 17 percent in excise and sales taxes, plus local governments have the option to tack on a tax of up to 3 percent.
Cuomo's plan: 22 percent Cuomo's proposal, which he unveiled in January, calls for three separate taxes.
The first tax would be on marijuana growers: $1 per dry-weight gram of cannabis flower plus $0.25 per dry-weight gram of cannabis trim.
Then there is a 20 percent state tax on marijuana when it's sold from a wholesaler to a retailer. If the wholesaler is also the retailer, then the retail customer pays it directly at the time of sale.
The third tax? Two percent that goes to the county where the retail dispensary is located.
All told, it would be a 22 percent tax on top of the per-gram taxes on marijuana growers. Sales tax wouldn't apply.
A pair of key Democratic state lawmakers, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal-Peoples Stokes, of Buffalo, and Sen. Liz Krueger, of Manhattan, have their own proposal, too.
It ultimately ends up in a similar place: a 15 percent excise tax plus the existing 4 percent state sales tax and a per-gram tax on growers. Local governments would be able to charge up to 2 percent.
Where they differ Where Cuomo and the key lawmakers differ is how they would split up the revenue.
Peoples-Stokes and Heastie have repeatedly said the bulk of the money should go toward communities that have been hit hard by strict drug laws over the years.
Across the state and nationwide, black and Hispanic people have been far more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.
It has been particularly pronounced in New York City, where black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at 8 times the rate white people were from 2015 through 2017, according to The New York Times.
Peoples-Stokes and Krueger's bill would take about half of the marijuana revenue and put it toward grants for "community-based nonprofits."
Those grants would have to go toward job training, mental-health treatment, adult education or other support services in communities that were "disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies."
About a quarter of the revenue would go into the state lottery fund, which distributes money for education. And the remaining quarter would be put toward funding public-education programs about drug use and addiction.
"When it comes to marijuana, and I've been clear to the governor and the mayor, is the first commitment from those revenues should be really toward community investments, particularly to those communities that have been impacted by the criminal justice issues," Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, told reporters Tuesday.
Weed for rails? Cuomo's original proposal is less specific, saying the revenue would go toward things like administering the marijuana program, improving traffic safety, small-business loans and public-health education.
But his plan would essentially give the governor's office total control over how the money is spent — something lawmakers often fight against.
On Tuesday, Cuomo unveiled a new plan: He and de Blasio want to keep a piece of marijuana revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the beleaguered New York City transit system.
It's an idea first floated three months ago by transit advocates and some city officials three months ago, including then-Public Advocate candidate Melissa Mark-Viverito, who dubbed it the "Weed for Rails" plan.
Cuomo and de Blasio didn't say how much they want to keep for the MTA, and Cuomo's office later clarified that the money would come from marijuana sales in New York City, not the entire state.
"I agree with folks in Albany that say some of that money needs to go to other important imperatives," de Blasio told reporters Wednesday. "But part of it should go to the MTA."
Mixed reaction The transit proposal got a mixed reaction among state lawmakers.
Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, sounded amenable — so long as the revenue comes from New York City's share.
"If the mayor and city council are comfortable with using their proceeds in that way, I don't have a problem with it," she told reporters Wednesday.
Her Republican counterpart, Minority Leader John Flanagan of Suffolk County, said the idea is ridiculous.
"This is nuts," Flanagan said. "The notion that we would legalize recreational marijuana and hope and pray that somehow a lot of people will smoke so we can have good buses and subway cars, that's ludicrous."
Local governments looking for more Local governments, meanwhile, are looking for a bigger cut of the revenue pie. Counties say the local tax should be 4 percent — the same as the current county-level sales tax in most parts of the state.
Stephen Acquario, executive director of the state Association of Counties, said 2 percent doesn't cut it, particularly when counties and municipalities will have to respond to any on-the-ground issues marijuana legalization brings.
"Only with sufficient funding will local governments be able to work in partnership with the state to oversee public health, public safety, criminal justice, consumer protection and economic development," he said in a statement.
The New York Conference of Mayors, which represents cities and villages across the state, held a series of panel discussions on Wednesday in Albany to examine marijuana legalization and what they can do to prepare. Pushing lawmakers and Cuomo for more local revenue was a common theme.
"I do think we should be very mindful of how the legislation will impact revenue sharing," said Susan Sommer, general counsel for the NYC Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice. "There should be enough coming to local governments to ensure we can do what we know to be the right things for our communities."
Melissa Mark-Viverito, a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, speaks at a news conference in December in New York. The former City Council speaker wants to use taxes from legal pot to pay for system repairs. Mark-Viverito announced her "Weed for Rails" plan outside the City Hall subway station.

Texto completo: Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the yearslong fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application - a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.
Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Cummings' letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.
"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

Texto completo: The statement: A reader took issue with U.S. Rep. Darren Soto's statement in a Feb. 21 Orlando Sentinel article about why it's taking so long for billions from in aid from Hurricane Maria to reach Puerto Rico. Soto said, "When we think about how this was done, at the highest death toll of any natural disaster in the history of the modern era here in the United States. ... It's a tragedy on a tragedy."
The facts: In an email, the reader cited the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires as having higher death tolls. The reader added, "post Irma studies 'excess deaths' stats are not easily verifiable."
First, we had to fact-check the fact-check request. Soto spoke of Maria, not Irma.
Checking Soto's statement wasn't as simple.
First, he says Hurricane Maria occurred in the "modern era." But what is that? Historians say modern era has about as many definitions as there are historians.
"I'm afraid there's no hard and fast definition," Princeton University historian Kevin Kruse wrote in an email. "Most historians would take that to mean post-WWII, but I suppose some others would see that as the full 20th century while others would say post-1980 (which I'd personally call "contemporary" history)."
"Saying 'modern' started in 1900 is certainly plausible, but one of many plausible options," wrote Yale historian David Engerman.
Eric Rutkow, a historian at UCF, puts the modern time-frame at post-Civil War. "It's definitely a thing historians love to discuss and debate."
Soto, a Kissimmee Democrat, said through a spokesman that he was referring to the late 20th to 21st century. Think post-Vietnam.
Determining the death toll from Maria is even more complicated. The Category 4 storm tore through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017. The official death toll from the National Hurricane Center stands at 65, far below the 6,000 to 12,000 estimated to have died from the Galveston storm and the estimated 3,000 who died from the 1906 earthquake and fire in and around San Francisco. That's also lower than the toll from other more recent disasters like Katrina.
Studies since Maria have established a significantly higher death toll.
One study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine compared the island's mortality rate after the storm to the mortality rate from the previous year and found 4,645 excess deaths.
Another study several months later by George Washington University also studied mortality and found 2,975 excess deaths on the island following Maria. This study prompted the government of Puerto Rico to revise its official death toll to reflect that number.
The New York Times examined vital statistics and found more than 1,000 people died than expected.
The key difference in the divergent totals is the difference between direct and indirect deaths from storms.
Direct storm deaths involve drowning or being caught in a collapsing building. Indirect deaths might result from someone being unable to get medical care or being unable to fill life-saving prescriptions.
Hurricane victims in Puerto Rico were stranded in remote areas for months. Roads were washed out so people couldn't get life-saving medications. Power was out so people sweltered in the late-summer heat or couldn't get medical equipment to function. Clean water was scarce.
The bottom line: Historians say there's no hard-and-fast rule to define the modern era, so Soto's view of it as the later part of the 20th century until now is valid. As for Maria's death toll, the Puerto Rican government has put the number at just under 3,000, in keeping with the George Washington University findings. No other U.S. natural disaster since the latter part of the 20th century has exceeded the estimated toll for Hurricane Maria. We rate Soto's statement Fact.

Texto completo: If anyone can dispel the toxicity of the past year at New York City Ballet, it is Wendy Whelan. So it was encouraging when the company announced on Thursday that it was handing over its artistic reins to Ms. Whelan and another former dancer, Jonathan Stafford. They succeed Peter Martins, who retired at the beginning of last year amid allegations of sexual and physical misconduct.
When the pair gave a brief pre-curtain speech on Thursday night, a beaming Mr. Stafford announced "the homecoming of one of the greatest artists in the history of New York City Ballet: Wendy Whelan."
[Read about the new leaders' appointment]
Ms. Whelan, who retired from the company in 2014 after 30 years, admitted she was nervous as she began to talk. It was endearing how she started to rock from side to side with straight legs. And if she faltered a bit, her sentiment came through clearly: She and Mr. Stafford, she said, want to "not only transform the company, but help lead and inspire the larger dance world as well."
Ms. Whelan's generous spirit, humor and intelligence will surely be a balm. As the principal dancer Sara Mearns wrote on Instagram, "I'm dying to be in the studio w/Wendy again!!" Ms. Mearns was also full of praise for Mr. Stafford.
I've always supported the idea of seeing two people share City Ballet's top position because of the job's immensity. But there's a problem here: equality. Mr. Stafford is to become the artistic director of both City Ballet and its affiliated School of American Ballet; Ms. Whelan has been named the associate artistic director of City Ballet.
The company has undergone much turmoil in recent months: Three male principal dancers were forced out after they were accused of sharing text messages of sexually explicit photos of women. In the current climate -- something City Ballet and its board should know a thing or two about -- elevating the job title of a man over a woman seems like a regressive, shortsighted and even cowardly act. It's also a confusing one given that in an interview in The New York Times the two said that "they intended to work as partners."
While City Ballet seems to be on the mend -- you could sense it the moment Mr. Stafford and Ms. Whelan stepped onstage and were greeted with roars of approval and in the dancers' elated bows on Thursday -- the new appointment signals an imbalance of power. Ms. Whelan's professional relationship with Mr. Stafford is missing a prefix, as in co-artistic director.
At the same time, it's progress. Ms. Whelan is the first woman to have a permanent leadership role on the artistic side at City Ballet.
Mr. Stafford, who has led an interim team since the resignation of Mr. Martins, possesses the kind of steady hand that has served the company, at least from the outside, well. He brought in former Balanchine dancers as coaches, as well as guest teachers for the company's daily class.
Ms. Whelan brings something else. She may not have the experience of running a ballet company -- few women do -- but she has star power. (Mr. Stafford, solid and serious, can't match her in charisma, and it's best that he doesn't try.) She certainly faces a steep learning curve. Until recently, she hasn't done a great deal of teaching, coaching dancers or staging ballets.
Hopefully, she's ready for those challenges and will be given ample chance to prove herself, to make mistakes and, most important, to become more than the public face of the company.
Neither Ms. Whelan nor Mr. Stafford is a choreographer, and that's good: The last thing City Ballet needs is a return to the gloomy period of the 1990s when Mr. Martins was churning out one mediocre ballet after another. But what will their day-to-day duties be? It seems that Mr. Stafford will have the authority: running the company and the school and deciding who dances what. But some of City Ballet's recent casting choices have been questionable; it has felt, uncomfortably at times, like friends casting friends instead of the best dancer for the part.
As associate artistic director, Ms. Whelan will focus on programming and commissioning works by choreographers, composers and other artists, as well as coaching and teaching. After leaving the company, she began to explore contemporary dance and to work with choreographers outside of the ballet world, including Kyle Abraham. Her taste is something I continue to wonder about -- for her program of duets, "Restless Creature," she seemed drawn to choreography based on how movement would feel on her body more than the resulting dance.
In her new position, she must be able to see the big picture. But there is reason for hope: Her recent project is a work by Lucinda Childs, the great postmodern choreographer. It's possible that many City Ballet dancers, especially the younger ones, have never heard of Ms. Childs, who has been choreographing ballets in Europe for years. Ms. Whelan's new job is an opportunity to impart, along with technique and musicality, some dance history beyond ballet, to be a bridge between the worlds of contemporary, or downtown dance, and its more classical uptown counterpart.
Ms. Whelan gets out into the world -- recently, I've seen her at New York Live Arts and the Museum of Modern Art. It's extremely important to know what's going on in dance outside Lincoln Center: This is an art form that is not only about the body but also about ideas, and Ms. Whelan has demonstrated in her own career, especially post-retirement, a solid grasp of that.
But even before she started exploring dance outside of City Ballet, Ms. Whelan was always a different kind of ballerina. Remembered for being angular, modern and sharp, during her final years at City Ballet she transformed into a dancer of such angelic authority that just watching her stand still on the stage could give you the chills. She knows a dancer doesn't have to spend a career being typecast. She'll fight against infantilism, particularly among the women.
A dancer can change, just as she did, and City Ballet will change, too. She concluded her onstage speech by talking about how the strength of the company had always come from the individual talent of its dancers, "showcased together by a strong sense of unity," she said. "Tonight, we are united and we are making history." It was good and true.

Re "The Moderates Take a Grilling Back at Home" (front page, Feb. 25):
Well, saints be praised! The New York Times ran an article about moderate Democrats!
You'd think by your coverage that we had all vanished from the earth. Please start giving fair time to the middle-leaning voices in our party. Too many articles about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the progressives. Not all of us lean that far left. Start talking about what the moderates are doing and where they stand on issues. Your coverage matters in this next presidential election. Don't blow it.

Mulvaney: 'Master negotiator' Trump still on good terms with Kim Jong Un

Texto completo: President Trump’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says that the president is still on good terms with Kim Jong Un, despite Trump walking out of a meeting with North Korea’s leader without a deal in hand.

Mulvaney, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday night, said the summit in Vietnam was a great trip and that he was “extraordinarily proud” of Trump.

“The president really is a master negotiator, and he was able to walk away from a deal,” Mulvaney said. "And did so in such a fashion to keep all of the connections, all of the relationships still intact.”

Mulvaney’s comments came during a guided discussion with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.

Mulvaney accompanied the president to Asia as part of ongoing U.S. negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program. He said that despite Trump walking out of a meeting with Kim and failing to secure a deal, there was no ill will between the two. Mulvaney said Trump wanted a deal but was not “desperate” for one.

“All I can tell you is he did exactly what you and I would have wanted him to do,” Mulvaney told Schlapp. “There was no way he could take the deal that the North Koreans offered him.”

Mulvaney said that Trump found it “very important” that he shake Kim’s hand before leaving negotiations, keeping the door open for further discussions.

“To tell somebody ‘no’ and not have them get angry with you is really a skill, and I’ve never seen it done like he was able to do,” Mulvaney added.

The chief of staff also mused at the size of the crowds lining the streets of Hanoi during the summit. He attributed the crowd size to Trump’s persona.

“I was stunned by that in a socialist country. His brand is international,” Mulvaney told Schlapp.

Also during the interview, Mulvaney discussed the president’s schedule and decried those who believe Trump isn’t working hard. Trump’s chief of staff said that he is with him every single day and knows when the phone calls and tweets start and end. He also said Trump is an avid reader, despite reports to the contrary.

“It’s the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New York Post, and the Wall Street Journal, cover-to-cover every single day,” Mulvaney said of Trump’s reading habits.

Mulvaney was chosen by Trump to be his acting chief of staff in December after his predecessor John Kelly resigned. Mulvaney is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a title he still holds despite the new role.

Although serving in an acting capacity, no successor has been announced and Mulvaney continues to serve indefinitely.

During his more than two-month tenure, Mulvaney has reportedly butted heads with Trump, specifically over funding for the border wall. Mulvaney also had critical words for Trump prior to the 2016 presidential election, calling him a “terrible human being” during a debate in South Carolina.

Despite any past animosity, Mulvaney said the president was doing a great job and that the White House is “a fun place to work.”

CPAC runs for three days. Trump is expected to address attendees of the conference Saturday.

Texto completo: EDITORS' NOTE APPENDEDIn the early 1920s, Casper Holstein, a black man from the Danish West Indies who worked as a porter for a Fifth Avenue store, liked to study the "Clearing House" totals published in a year's worth of newspapers he'd saved. The Clearing House was an operation that managed the exchanges of money among New York City banks on a daily basis. It occurred to Holstein that the numbers printed were different every day.
Until then, lottery games existed, but the winning numbers were often chosen in unreliable ways that could produce rigged results. According to the 2010 book "Playing the Numbers," Holstein came up with an ingenious solution. Using the Clearing House totals to produce a random combination between 000 and 999, he came up with a daily three-digit winning number for a new kind of lottery game. His invention became known simply as the numbers.
It was an immediate hit and quickly created a sprawling underground economy that moved through Harlem and other black communities in the U.S. For 60 years, the numbers reigned supreme as New York City's pre-eminent daily lottery game -- until 1980, when the state decided it wanted in.
In Detroit, my own mother, Fannie Davis, ran a numbers business for 34 years. That business provided us, her children, with a solid middle-class life, including a spacious family home, beautiful clothes and college educations -- and, thanks to our inheritance, generational wealth. While the numbers were illegal, and therefore had to be kept a secret, I knew about another girl with a parent who ran numbers: Her name was Francie and she lived in Harlem, and she was real to me, even though she was in fact a character in a book.
When I was 10, my mom gave me a copy of Louise Meriwether's novel "Daddy Was A Number Runner," a fictionalized account of the author's life in 1930s Harlem, where the numbers helped sustain black folks through the Great Depression, when lucky players could turn a hard-earned nickel into $30. The book, published in 1970, has a foreword by James Baldwin, who wrote, "the metaphor for this growing apprehension of the iron and insurmountable rigors of one's life are here conveyed by that game known in Harlem as the numbers, the game which contains the possibility of making a 'hit' -- the American dream in black-face, Horatio Alger revealed, the American success story with the price tag showing!"
I recently reread Meriwether's book -- still in print thanks to the Feminist Press at the City University of New York -- and her story helped me remember how vital the numbers were to black life. But The New York Times archives enlightened me about the fight of the city's black elected officials, activists and everyday people to preserve this cultural and economic institution -- and how much was lost when New York State usurped the game.
Much of that loss was jobs. In 1971, The Times reported that an estimated "60 percent of the area's economic life depends on cash flow from the numbers," which employed an estimated 100,000 workers across the five boroughs. Numbers men also in many ways filled the void left by a formal economy indifferent to black residents' needs: They bankrolled many small businesses, from bars to restaurants to corner groceries, and also saved many businesses from bankruptcy. These bankers helped get out the vote, buttressed black civil rights groups and contributed to black political candidates' campaigns.
Numbers money provided a foundation from which stellar careers could be launched in everything from athletics to public service to entertainment. Colin Powell's father bought their family home with proceeds from hitting the Number. Harry Belafonte's Uncle Lenny ran a numbers racket and was an early example of success for the singer. The singer Lena Horne's father, Teddy, was a numbers operator. Stephanie St. Clair, known as Madame Queen, was one of the only women to run a successful numbers game in Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s, and became both an activist and major black employer. Such figures were often pillars of the community.
As early as 1971, when off-track-betting interests were looking to move in on the numbers action, Harlem activist James R. Lawson testified in favor of maintaining local control of the game before a legislative committee. "We intend to run it, come hell or high water," he said.
Six years later, Lawson proposed, in a radio address directed at Gov. Hugh Carey, that black and Hispanic numbers bankers buy franchises for 4,000 state-licensed numbers operations; the goal was to ensure that African-Americans benefited from a sanctioned lottery rather than fall victim to a "poor tax" burden. Yet Lawson and other black leaders, U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel among them, were not ultimately successful.
By 1980, the street-run business in New York was generating an estimated $800 million to $1.5 billion a year. That's why when lawmakers in Albany proposed a similar, daily pick-three lottery that year, a coalition of city and state officials feared there would be a crackdown on the numbers, and tried to stop the move. If the traditional numbers game could get legalized, the revenue could circulate in the black community and numbers workers could be legitimized and keep their jobs.
To the largely white Assembly -- as the City College of New York historian Matthew Vaz has pointed out -- the black and Hispanic participants in the numbers game were merely tax evaders and criminals. Also, New York legislators sold the public on the notion that a state-run version of the lottery would funnel a portion of the proceeds to education. This anticipation of lottery revenue, by the way, prompted New York legislators to reallocate education funds to other parts of the state budget.
Still, folks tried to fight back and marched through the streets to Gov. Carey's New York office. A sign posted in a Harlem Numbers parlor asked, "Does Gov. Carey knows How Many People Are Working In the Numbers Industry. He is Sending Our Families Back to Welfare. We don't Want Welfare. We Want Our Jobs."
Nevertheless, the state-run daily lottery began in September 1980, and in subsequent years the numbers game mostly faded away.
In most of these photos you see the criminal aspects of the numbers, rather than the everyday-ness -- the communal, reciprocal and congratulatory qualities. Only one image captures the whimsically designed "tip sheets" used to help players choose a number to play. Another captures Old Aunt Dinah's Dream Book of Numbers, and Gypsy's Witch Dream Book of Numbers, two of many simple yet illuminating publications used as bibles for numbers players. These encyclopedic books interpreted dreams by assigning three-digit numbers to different symbols, and nearly any image or experience that could appear in a dream.
Dreams were everything to numbers players, just as dreams have deep significance in black culture. Many black folks believed when they dreamed about something specific, that spirit was blessing them with a certain number to play. This is one key way that the Numbers is intricately connected to black folks' larger sense of hoping for a better future, of getting closer to achieving the American dream.
The New York State Lottery Commission seemed to understand this, eventually adopting the slogan "All You Need Is A Dollar And A Dream." But by then, Harlem had known that for decades.

Texto completo: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that he has been in contact with Amazon.com Inc. executives, urging them to rethink their decision to abandon plans for a headquarters campus in Queens.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters on Long Island that there is no sign yet that the tech company has changed its mind. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Cuomo spoke with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos after the company abruptly told state officials it was scuttling the new development on Feb. 14.
"I've had many conversations with Amazon. I hope that they reconsider," Mr. Cuomo said.
The overture shows the lasting reverberations of Amazon's reversal of its plan to come to New York. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio offered up to $3 billion of state and city incentives to bring it to the Long Island City neighborhood. In return, Amazon promised to invest $2.5 billion and create 25,000 jobs.
Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, drafted an open letter to Mr. Bezos that is set to publish Friday in the New York Times. That paper first reported Mr. Cuomo's outreach to Mr. Bezos.
"Everybody's been exploring if there are ways to save this," Ms. Wylde said in an interview.
Mr. de Blasio has faulted Amazon since the collapse of the deal. Mr. Cuomo has blamed Democrats who control the New York state Senate. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins nominated a vocal opponent of the Amazon deal, state Sen. Mike Gianaris of Queens, to a state board that would have held sway over the project.
Ms. Stewart-Cousins has since nominated another colleague, Sen. Leroy Comrie, in place of Mr. Gianaris.
Representatives of Amazon and Mr. de Blasio didn't comment on the matter.

What Does Kim Want? The Trump sales pitch depends on persuading the ultimate crime boss to go legitimate.

Texto completo: This column continues to doubt that President Trump can persuade North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to dismantle his nuclear weapons program, but remains eager to be proven wrong. After the tyrant of Pyongyang signalled last summer that he saw some virtues in a more open, thriving economy, this week's failure to reach an agreement with Mr. Trump suggests Mr. Kim may be content to run a heavily-armed but impoverished country.
Mr. Trump is offering North Korea peace and prosperity. The U.S. President amused much of the American media last summer by showing Mr. Kim a promotional video depicting an open North Korea that, having abandoned its nuclear ambitions, grows wealthy by attracting foreign trade, investment and tourism.
Right after the Singapore meeting in June, Mr. Trump
described his marketing video and the potential for North Korea:
...that was a version of what could happen, what could take place. As an example, they have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right? I said, "Boy, look at the view. Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?" And I explained, I said, "You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there." Think of it from a real estate perspective. You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle. How bad is that, right? It's great... I tell you what — he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad, and I'm telling you they really enjoyed it, I believe.
The message from Mr. Trump has remained constant. He is trying to sell a murderous thug on the benefits of becoming a law-abiding citizen. Before this week's meeting in Vietnam, Mr. Trump said :
I think that no matter what happens, we're going to ultimately have a deal that's really good for Chairman Kim and his country, and for us... And I really believe that, with this great leadership, I really believe that North Korea is going to be very successful, and economically, it's going to be something very, very special.
After the meeting the President continued to sell the upside :
I think he's got a chance to have one of the most successful countries — rapidly, too — on Earth. Incredible country, incredible location. You're right between — if you think of it, you have, on one side, Russia and China, and on the other you have South Korea, and you're surrounded by water and among the most beautiful shorelines in the world.
There is tremendous potential in North Korea, and I think he's going to lead it to a very important thing, economically. I think it's going to be an absolute economic power.
But if Mr. Kim wants a thriving North Korea, why does he continue to resist the obvious path to making it happen? Our friend Gordon Chang, author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World," suspects the Trump sales pitch may have the opposite effect of the one intended if Mr. Kim sees a more open society as the main potential threat to his regime.
Do men like Mr. Kim really want to retire from a life of crime? In 1999 Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in the New York Times magazine about American mobsters and specifically a former head of the Gambino crime family:
Paul Castellano had a vision for his children: he did not want them to be like him. He wanted them to be entirely legitimate, upstanding members of their community. He shielded them from the mob, and he set them up in businesses that could earn them money legally...
The Castellano story is not unusual. Among the hundreds of ''made men'' who make up the membership of New York's Five Families, many among them surely hope their sons will follow them into their peculiar profession. But many more among them don't: more and more frequently, sons of the mob are graduating from law school and medical school or playing by the rules in the world of legitimate business.
''Only a real gavone [sic] wants for his kids what we got,'' a former captain in the Colombo crime family, Salvatore (Big Sal) Miciotta, once told me. A gavone is a lowlife. Big Sal, who weighs 350 pounds and has killed five men (''I'm feeling tremendous amounts of remorse,'' he said), argued that the Five Families are headed for dissolution because of what might be called a crisis of human-resource management. ''Idiots and wannabes are who's attracted to this life now,'' he said.
Castellano was not able to decide the circumstances of his retirement. In 1985 he was shot and killed on the orders of a subordinate, John Gotti, who had no interest in pursuing a life of legitimate business.
Gotti gained control of the crime family, which subsequently saw its wealth dwindle, and he ended up dying in prison.
The North Korean people would no doubt welcome the Trump sales pitch. And the President is obviously enthusiastic about the product he's selling. But in walking away from the negotiating table this week, Mr. Trump also seems to understand that he's negotiating with a low-life.

Texto completo: It's unclear if move was requested by North Korea or U.S.
HANOI - The White House abruptly banned four U.S. journalists from covering President Trump's dinner here Wednesday with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after some of them shouted questions at the leaders during their earlier meetings.
Reporters from the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, the Los Angeles Times and Reuters were excluded from covering the dinner because of what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said were "sensitivities over shouted questions in the previous sprays." Among the questions asked of Trump was one about the congressional testimony of his former attorney Michael Cohen.
The White House's move to restrict press access was an extraordinary act of retaliation by the U.S. government, which historically has upheld the rights of journalists while a president travels overseas. It was especially remarkable because it came during Trump's meeting with the leader of a totalitarian state that does not have a free press.
Trump's exchanges with Kim were being covered by the standard 13-member traveling White House press pool, but ahead of the dinner, Sanders sought to exclude all reporters from the pool and permit only the photographers and television crew.
After loud pushback, including from photojournalists who protested, Sanders allowed a single reporter in the pool for the dinner: Vivian Salama of the Wall Street Journal, who was serving as the print pooler and did not ask a question at the dinner. In addition, at least two members of the North Korean media contingent, a photographer and cameraman, were seen covering the dinner.
Reporters for the three wire services, as well as a second print pooler, were excluded. They included two journalists who had asked Trump questions in the earlier appearances: Jonathan Lemire of the AP and Jeff Mason of Reuters. Also excluded were Justin Sink of Bloomberg and Eli Stokols of the Los Angeles Times.
In a statement, Sanders said: "Due to the sensitive nature of the meetings we have limited the pool for the dinner to a smaller group, but ensured that representation of photographers, TV, radio and print Poolers are all in the room. We are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the U.S. media has as much access as possible."
Sanders did not specify whether the White House was retaliating against journalists who asked questions at the request of Trump or of Kim or the North Korean delegation. Asked by The Washington Post to clarify, Sanders referred to her written statement.
Journalists in the pool asked Sanders repeatedly whether North Korea was responsible for the White House's decision to curb access, but she declined to give a direct answer. "I wouldn't say that," she said, according to two people present for the discussions.
Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement that the group "strenuously objects to the capricious decision to exclude some journalists from a press encounter with President Trump and Chairman Kim."
"This summit provides an opportunity for the American presidency to display its strength by facing vigorous questioning from a free and independent news media, not telegraph weakness by retreating behind arbitrary last-minute restrictions on coverage," Knox continued. "We call on the White House to not allow a diminution of the previously agreed-to press complement for the remainder of the summit."
Lauren Easton, a spokeswoman for the AP, said in a statement: "The Associated Press decries such efforts by the White House to restrict access to the president. It is critically important that any president uphold American press freedom standards, not only at home but especially while abroad."
Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, said in a statement: "Previous administrations have often intervened to protect press access when foreign leaders have tried to limit coverage of presidential meetings abroad. The fact that this White House has done the opposite and excluded members of the press provides another sad example of its failure to uphold the American public's right to see and be informed about President Trump's activities."
The move came a day after the U.S. press corps was kicked out of its filing center in Hanoi at the request of the North Korean entourage. The White House booked conference facilities at the Melia hotel as a press workspace, paid for by news organizations, but the hotel in the heart of the city also happened to be where Kim and his delegation decided to stay. As Kim's motorcade headed toward Hanoi on Tuesday, Vietnamese officials suddenly booted the U.S. media from the hotel and relocated their operations to a separate site sharing space with the international press corps.
During Trump's first visit with Kim on Wednesday night, American reporters asked Trump four questions during two brief photo opportunities; they asked Kim none. Eight North Korean reporters were also present for the summit - the entirely male contingent wore pins celebrating Kim Jong Un and were dressed alike - but they asked no questions.
When Trump and Kim first shook hands, Mason asked whether Trump had walked back his vow to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. "No," the president replied.
Lemire asked whether he would declare an end to the Korean War, to which Trump replied, "We'll see."
A few minutes later, when Trump and Kim sat down for their one-on-one meeting, Lemire asked Trump whether he had a response to Cohen's testimony. Trump shook his head and did not answer.
Trump has long complained about reporters asking him questions at photo opportunities, especially when he is in the presence of foreign leaders; aides have said he views it as disrespectful and lacking in decorum. Trump has called the mainstream media "the enemy of the people," and the White House occasionally has punished reporters for their questioning, including CNN's Jim Acosta and Kaitlan Collins.
This was not the first time Lemire and Mason had asked uncomfortable questions of Trump on foreign soil. Both posed sharp questions to the president at his 2018 Helsinki news conference alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump later complained to aides about their questions, although he has since granted interviews to both reporters.
At Wednesday's dinner with Kim, Trump made small talk with the press pool. "Everybody having a great time?" he asked.
After his press secretary kicked the four reporters out of the pool, Trump joked to Kim that the "media make us look very good!" The president also pointed to photojournalist Doug Mills of the New York Times and told Kim he was "one of the great photographers of the world."
Past administrations have struggled to balance access for U.S. reporters as presidents have met with authoritarian regimes, including China, that have sought to limit the number of reporters in the room. When President Barack Obama met with Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao on the sidelines of a regional summit in Bali in 2011, the White House barred wire services and a newspaper reporter from the photo op, allowing in only news photographers. That drew protests on the spot from the press pool, including a Washington Post reporter.
In 2009, when Obama made his first visit to Beijing, he held a news conference with China's then-president, Hu Jintao, at which reporters from both countries were not allowed to ask questions. During a trip by Vice President Joe Biden to Beijing in 2011, U.S. reporters were ushered out of a meeting by Chinese security officials as Biden was still making his opening remarks, leading to a scuffle.

Texto completo: Now that Rep. Adam Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee have opened an investigation into the Russia affair, and President Donald Trump has darkly warned in his State of the Union speech that “America will never be a socialist country,” it seems timely to recall a long-forgotten tale of revenge over unrequited love, in which members of the Koch family, which had helped build Joseph Stalin’s oil refineries, found their investments nationalized and themselves embittered.
In 1925, Fred C. Koch joined his MIT classmate Lewis E. Winkler to found the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company in Wichita, Kansas. After losing patent infringement lawsuits to more established oil and gas companies, they sought business overseas. Between 1929 and 1932, during Stalin’s first Five-Year Plan, Winkler-Koch built 15 thermal cracking units for Stalin, turning crude oil into gasoline.
Jane Mayer, in a book that grew out of a 2010 article in The New Yorker , an unauthorized assessment of the Koch family’s spending habits, “Dark Money” (2016), quotes Gus diZerega, a “former friend of Charles Koch”: “As the Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up.”
Perhaps. But that did not stop Winkler-Koch, in 1934, from providing engineering plans and overseeing construction of a huge oil refinery near Hamburg under the direction of Adolf Hitler, whom Fred Koch approached directly, purportedly greeting him with: “Heil Hitler.” The Winkler-Koch factory became a major source of fuel for the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) and the mechanized tank and motorized attack forces that powered the Blitzkrieg into Belgium, Denmark, Poland and France. The factory was destroyed by Allied bombers late in the war.
After these investments in Stalin and Hitler, Fred Koch devolved into a fervent anti-Communist, though his soft spot for fascists persisted, as he wrote admiringly of Mussolini’s suppression of the left. In 1958, he helped found the John Birch Society, whose members considered then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower a Communist agent.
In his own country, Koch also held distinct views on people he referred to as “coloreds.” “The colored man looms large in the Communist plot to take over America,” Koch wrote. Jane Mayer notes that Koch’s argument was that welfare payments would attract blacks to cities where they would foment a “vicious race war.” Koch predicted that Communists would “infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.”
Koch thus became an avowed enemy of those from whom he could not make money, as his ideology trailed behind the money. By the 1990s and 2000s, however, Koch Sr. and his sons would reverse this direction, pouring hundreds of millions into efforts to affect the ideological stripe of American politics, reflected most fully in the Tea Party and now the president.
During the same period, another self-made multimillionaire named Fred Trump Sr. was exploring his own relationship with the black population of Queens. On Memorial Day, 1927, he was arrested during a Ku Klux Klan protest against the “Catholic police of New York City,” according to Philip Bump in the Washington Post.
Fred Trump’s second son, Donald, was introduced to the New York real estate market by his father, who had grown rich on FHA-backed federal housing contracts. Donald began receiving money transfers from Fred Sr. almost from birth, according to recent reporting in the New York Times by David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner. All told, the Times documented 295 streams of revenue created by Trump Sr. to enrich his son as Donald careened from “one financial disaster to the next.” To date, while the Times article has been noted by New York tax authorities, the illegality of these transfers has yet to catch up. When he died in 1999, Fred Trump Sr. had effectively bailed out his errant and incompetent son for 25 years.
While Donald Trump’s real-estate business skidded and hit bottom in the 1990s and early 2000s, a geopolitical drama was unfolding in Russia. As the Soviet state imploded, a “new Russia” emerged that, in many ways, looked a lot like the oligarchic, kleptocratic structure of the former Soviet Union, but now branded itself as an exemplar of democracy and privatization. Privatization, especially of formerly national oil revenues, was of particular notice. And the revenue streams for the oligarchs who seized control of these assets were huge.
Donald Trump’s need for real estate cash infusions, as more and more banks refused to lend to him, lined up with the Russian oligarchs’ need to launder billions of rubles pilloried from privatization schemes, including some remnants of the Koch-built oil and gas works. Russian oligarchs were looking for places in the West to convert their dirty money, skimmed from privatization, into real property assets preferably denominated in dollars. Trump was ready, willing and able to launder their plunder through real estate in New York, Florida and elsewhere, with the help of a few remaining cooperating financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank.
The oligarchs were also appreciative, and the ascendant Vladimir Putin marked Donald Trump, in Lenin’s words, as a useful idiot. When he announced his bid for president in 2015, an ambition he had harbored for years, most Republicans thought him a fool. But as his appeal to his xenophobic and undereducated base became an electoral avalanche, and he was nominated, Republicans everywhere became docile and loyal. The Kremlin moved in to aid and assist, working with Trump Jr. and son-in-law Kushner on the campaign targeting efforts, as Manafort sent polling and other campaign data through his Ukrainian contacts to Moscow for use by the Internet Research Service. Even the clear evidence of Kremlin involvement in his run elicited not condemnation from the Republican Party but compliance. This was clear in both Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Mitch McConnell’s strong advice to their Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to steer clear of the Russian connection in the interest of retaining Republican political control.
At this point, in late 2016, after the election that would deliver much more to Russia than envisioned even in the fiction of the Manchurian Candidate, the GOP had staked its future to Putin and his program of destabilizing democracies in the West. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests KGB involvement in the Brexit vote and in the far-right movement of Marie Le Pen in France as well.
The right — in America, in Britain and in France — is now owned by the Russian deep state, and through willing enablers such as the NRA, has become a conduit for Russian funds and influence. So now the final revenge of the KGB’s Russia for the West has been revealed. They have nearly destroyed British parliamentary democracy. They have deeply undermined post-war French modernism. And they have helped install in the U.S. a buffoonish puppet, less intelligent if less inebriated than Boris Yeltsin, whose weakness Vladimir Putin also came to exploit. While few care to admit it, the result may very well be the end of the American experiment in democracy.
Let us retrace our steps. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the Koch family, oblivious in the interest of profits to the national interest, or the threat posed by fascism or communism, sought to do deals with Hitler and Stalin in Germany and Russia. In the 1980s and 1990s, Donald Trump inherited and largely squandered his father’s real estate empire, launching scheme after ill-fated scheme, only to be bailed out by the senior Trump. As the 2000s broke, Trump turned to Russian oligarchs seeking a haven for funds from their profiteering of former Soviet assets. The oligarchs’ gangster-like methods of nationalization as privatization combined Stalin’s forced takeovers with monetizing formerly national assets. Then, former Soviet agents in the KGB, led by Putin, began a program of money-laundering which met the needs of both the oligarchs and the Trump Organization as the Trump family became Putin’s latter-day useful idiots. Then, in 2016, the odd Russian bet on one such idiot, like a bet on 23 red on a roulette wheel, paid off big time.
At that point, the problem for both Trump and (to a lesser extent, having already won the bet) Putin, became how to cover and obfuscate the obvious quid pro quo. The cover has been like a thin gauze, the quid pro quo obvious to all. The question now is one of survival for American democratic institutions, largely absent the Republican Party, which is trapped, compromised, traitorous and corrupted.

Texto completo: The 2019 inductees into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame include an Emmy-winning composer, an iconic rock radio station, a folk singer/songwriter, a music promoter/club owner and the man who sang lead vocals on the Beach Boys hit "Help me Rhonda."
The five new members will be inducted during a ceremony at 7 p.m. Sunday, April 28, at the Eastman Theatre.
Honorees are composer and record producer Jack Allocco; founding member, guitarist and vocalist for the Beach Boys Al Jardine; folk singer Christine Lavin; music promoter and owner of Henrietta's former Red Creek Inn Jeffrey Springut; and classic rock radio station WCMF-FM (96.5).
Jimmy Richmond, RMFH board member and music director, announced the 2019 class during a ceremony Tuesday at the organization's new home at 25 Gibbs St.
"Rochester has a rich and diverse musical heritage, and we are proud to foster and celebrate that through the Rochester Music Hall of Fame," said group President Jack Whittier.
Allocco is an 11-time Emmy Award-winning composer, conductor and songwriter. He is the composer for Sony Pictures Television's The Young and the Restless and CBS Television's The Bold and the Beautiful. He has also won 13 consecutive ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards and worked as a composer and producer for numerous established artists. Additionally, he has toured with theatrical productions and symphonies and performed with Robert Goulet and Peter Allen.
Allocco was born and raised in Rochester and credits former Bishop Kearney High School music teacher Ray Shahin with helping him choose music as a career. He currently resides in Nashville.
Al Jardine is a founding member of the Beach Boys, a 1988 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award Grammy. He spent part of his childhood in Rochester, as his photographer father took a job with Eastman Kodak Co. and taught at Rochester Institute of Technology.
It was here that his love of music ignited, Jardine told RMHF.
"In Rochester, my parents bought me a four-string ukulele that I picked on," he said in a written statement.
Folk singer Christine Lavin is described by The New York Times as "a garrulous comic observer of contemporary manners."
Over a career spanning more than three decades, Lavin has played in thousands of venues across the world and released 23 albums. Her most recent, Spaghettification, reached No. 5 on the International Folk DJ Chart. She has won five ASCAP composer awards, the Backstage Bistro Award for best NYC singer/songwriter of the year and Album of the Year from the National Association of Independent Record Distributors.
Inductee Jeffrey Springut ran the Red Creek Inn from 1970 to 1997 and welcomed an illustrious array of artists to his stage during those years, including Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, James Brown, David Crosby, Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
He's a lifelong Rochester resident who continues to book recognizable attractions via his Springut Group, which runs events including the Lilac Festival, Park Ave Summer Art Festival, Party in the Park and Midtown Eats. The Springut Group also books concerts for Highland Bowl and Kodak Center.
"But it's never about me, it's about the music," Springut told RMHF. "We always thought if we're not having fun, why bother?"
Rock radio station WCMF is one of only five rock stations in the nation that have not changed its musical format or call letters in more than 50 years. The station is credited with breaking several rock acts into the mainstream through heavy rotation and promotion and is considered a "heritage station."
Now owned by Entercom Rochester, the station got its start under the name Community Music Service Inc.
During the April 27 ceremony, WCMF radio personality Dave Kane will be awarded a Special Merit Award for his 38 years on the air and his contributions to music in the community.
Bruce Pilato, RMHF board member and show producer, said this year's show will not disappoint people hoping for major-name surprise guests. However, he wouldn't let the cat out of the bag on Tuesday.
Allocco, Lavin and Jardine — who will be accompanied by "some friends" — are all scheduled to perform, Pilato said.
At last year's celebration, Paul Simon took the stage during a performance by inductees Steve Gadd and Tony Levin.
"We're still in negotiations to get a few celebrities at the event," said Pilato. "I can tell you I don't think we've let you guys down in the past — we always come through with a great lineup and we have some incredible platinum-level artists we are negotiating with right now."
He said upcoming announcements will include the names of artists who will honor Springut and WCMF.
Tickets to the April 28 ceremony and performance are priced at $31 to $79 and are on sale now at the Eastman Theatre box office, or online at tickets.eastmantheatre.org and rochestermusic.org. Additionally, tickets and be purchased by calling (585) 274-3000.

COUNCIL TO TAKE UP MAKING PREGNANCY A PROTECTED CLASS

Texto completo: Just four weeks before her due date, Pittsburgh Councilwoman Erika Strassburger proposed amendments to the city's anti-discrimination law, calling on council to elevate pregnancy to its own protected class under an existing city ordinance.
The proposal would bar employers from discriminatory practices related to hiring, training, promotions and firing, among other actions, based on whether a woman is pregnant, and extend new rights to the woman's partner.
"This legislation expands and clarifies exactly the type of employment discrimination that is not allowed when it comes to pregnant workers anywhere in Pittsburgh," Ms. Strassburger said at a press conference Tuesday.
She was joined at the podium by representatives from the city's Human Relations Commission as well as local women's advocates.
"It's just not an opportunity, it's a legal right to choose to have a baby and to work and to live," said Kathi Elliott, CEO of Gwen's Girls, a nonprofit serving low-income girls in Allegheny County.
Pregnancy is already protected under the city's workplace anti-discrimination code but is categorized under the class of sex. Pregnancy was included in 2014 when then-Councilman Dan Gilman championed the measure. Mr. Gilman is now Mayor Bill Peduto's chief of staff.
Employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation and nine other classes is illegal in Pittsburgh. Under the proposal, the law would continue to apply to workplaces with at least five employees.
Ms. Strassburger said the city's Commission on Human Relations brought to her attention that pregnancy could become its own protected class under the city code, and she worked with the commission to develop the proposed amendment.
Being pregnant has heightened her awareness, she said, and a recent New York Times series on pregnancy discrimination in the workplace caught her attention.
Megan Stanley, the commission's deputy director, said pregnancy discrimination is "probably very underreported."
"This year we've seen more pregnancy discrimination cases than in prior years," Ms. Stanley said. "People are coming forward and saying 'You know, I'm not sure if this is discrimination, but I was told that since I'm about to have a child that maybe I don't want that promotion because maybe I wouldn't have the time for it.' Those are discriminatory statements."
Still, Ms. Stanley said, pregnancy discrimination complaints account for less than 10 percent of complaints filed.
The scrutiny of discriminatory practices under the proposed amendment would also extend to partners - without regard to gender and marital status - who need to care for pregnant partners, a provision that Ms. Strassburger characterized as "trailblazing."
"If you're a partner, and you feel you need to go to an appointment with your partner or need to spend time with a [pregnant] partner who's grieving after a miscarriage or whatever it is, you're protected under this law," she said.
The commission has explicit power to investigate discrimination complaints, Ms. Strassburger and Ms. Stanley said, and therefore the amendment would not be subject to state pre-emption. That means it might not face a court challenge, like council efforts to mandate paid sick leave, which are currently before the state Supreme Court.
"For example, we added gender identity and expression. We've added, for housing protections, survivors of domestic violence. Commissions around the country do this under home rule charters all the time," Ms. Stanley said.
While federal and state pregnancy protection laws exist, Susan Frietsche, senior staff attorney for the Women's Law Project, calls them "weak," as not all employers are included and "reasonable" accommodations for pregnant workers are not guaranteed. Federal and state bills addressing this issue "have not moved an inch," she said.
"There are a lot of gaps in the law" that the city may be able to fill, Ms. Frietsche said.
A pregnant worker would have 365 days to file a complaint with the city's human relations commission. From there, the agency would begin an investigation process.
Ms. Strassburger urged the notion of the commission as a resource.
"You can ask a question, you can get answers from the commission as to whether what you're experiencing is discrimination," she said.
The commission issued a guidance document along with Ms. Strassburger's proposed changes to the law.
Council could discuss the proposal next week.

Texto completo: Ballet West’s version of the Christmas classic “The Nutcracker” will mark its 75th anniversary this year — and will be one of the highlights of the dance troupe’s 2019-2020 season.
The Salt Lake City-based dance company announced its new season Tuesday, touting a rarely performed work by George Balanchine, the return of a popular love story, and the staging of a Shakespeare classic.
“This will be a season of history, mystery, glamour and drama,” Ballet West artistic director Adam Sklute said in a statement.
The show that will draw the biggest audiences, as it does every year, is “The Nutcracker.”
This year’s production of the holiday favorite — set to run from Dec. 6 to Christmas Eve — will mark 75 years since Ballet West’s late founder Willam Christensen staged the first full-length version, in 1944 with the San Francisco Ballet. Mr. C, as everyone called Christensen, returned to Utah in 1955 to open the first accredited ballet school at the University of Utah. He continued his “Nutcracker” tradition at the school, and then at Ballet West when the company began in 1963.
The production has been praised by critics outside Utah. In 2010, The New York Times sent its dance critic, Alexander Macaulay, across the country to watch two dozen productions of “The Nutcracker," and he rated Ballet West’s “the best discovery of my ‘Nutcracker’ marathon.” Ballet West has taken the show to the Kennedy Center in Washington eight times, most recently last year.
The show has undergone revisions through the decades, most recently a $3 million project to create new costumes and sets, completed in 2017. Through each update, though, Mr. C’s choreography has remained intact.
As part of the anniversary celebrations, Ballet West is collaborating with BYUtv to produce a broadcast version of the ballet, to air on Dec. 1. The dance company restaged its version of “The Nutcracker” at the Capitol Theatre over three days in mid-February, during a break in its recent production of “Swan Lake.” The TV special will also feature documentary elements, including interviews with the creative team.
Ballet West will start its season, Oct. 25-Nov. 2, with “Balanchine’s Ballets Russes,” a trio of works choreographed by the legendary George Balanchine, and marking the 110th anniversary of the founding of Sergei Diaghilev’s revolutionary dance company.
The program begins with the U.S. premiere of “The Song of the Nightingale,” a reconstruction of Balanchine’s first collaboration with the composer Igor Stravinsky. The work, which tells of a songbird healing a Chinese emperor, in its original version featured sets and costumes by the artist Henri Matisse.
Also on the opening program: “Apollo,” Balanchine’s second work with Stravinsky, based on Greek mythology; and “Prodigal Son,” based on the gospel of Luke, with music by Sergei Prokoviev, and Balanchine’s last work before Ballets Russes disbanded and he left for America.
The romantic ghost story “Giselle” returns for a Valentine’s Day run, Feb. 7-15. Sklute first staged his “reconceived” version of the classic work in 2014, and it was a hit with Utah audiences.
Two works will be paired in a show running April 17-25: “The Dream,” choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton’s 1964 retelling of William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” to music by Felix Mendelssohn; and “Bolero,” a work by Ballet West’s resident choreographer Nicolo Fonte’s work, set to Maurice Ravel’s famously rhythmic score.
Ballet West will once again play host to the World Choreographic Festival, May 14-16. Singapore Dance Theatre and the Royal New Zealand Ballet will be the visiting troupes. Ballet West plans to premiere two works by choreographers Jennifer Archibald and Matthew Neenan.
Ballet West II will perform another world premiere, “Snow White,” set to a score by Edvard Grieg by in-house choreographers Pamela Robinson and Peggy Dolkas. The work, part of the Family Classics Series, will be performed three times, on Nov. 8 and 9. The show is a fleeting 90 minutes, and includes guided narration to help younger audience members along.
All shows except one will be performed at the Capitol Theatre, 50 W. 200 South, Salt Lake City. The exception is the World Choreographic Festival, which will take place at the Rose Wagner Center for the Performing Arts, 138 W. 300 South, Salt Lake City.
Individual tickets will go on sale in September; subscription packages and season memberships are on sale now.

Texto completo: The New York Review of Books has installed two editors to lead the magazine after being without a top editor since the sudden departure of Ian Buruma in September. Rea Hederman, the publisher of the intellectual journal, announced Monday that Emily Greenhouse, 32, and Gabriel Winslow-Yost, 33, have been named co-editors, and that Daniel Mendelsohn, a longtime contributor to the Review, will assume the newly created role of editor at large.
The shared-power arrangement echoes the history of the magazine, which was founded in 1963 by Robert Silvers and Barbara Epstein and edited by the pair until Epstein's death in 2006. Silvers then maintained control of the publication -- with monomaniacal focus, by all accounts -- until his death, at 87, in 2017.
The announcement of the new editors comes more than five months after Buruma, Silvers's successor, left his position amid an uproar over the publication and ensuing defense of an essay about the #MeToo movement by Jian Ghomeshi, a Canadian radio broadcaster who had been accused of sexually assaulting women. Soon after Buruma departed, the magazine issued a statement acknowledging "failures in the presentation and editing" of the essay.
Greenhouse and Winslow-Yost both have experience at the storied publication they will now lead. Greenhouse was most recently the managing editor of The New Yorker. She worked at the Review in 2011 and 2012, as an editorial assistant to Silvers. Winslow-Yost began working at the Review, also as an editorial assistant to Silvers, in 2009, and moved up the editorial ranks to become a senior editor.
Given the fallout over the Ghomeshi essay and the widely noted gender imbalance among the magazine's contributors, there was speculation that a woman would succeed Buruma. In 2017, women wrote about 23 percent of the pieces published in the Review, according to the nonprofit organization VIDA: Women in Literary Arts. Greenhouse (whose father, Steven Greenhouse, was a longtime reporter for The New York Times) said that addressing the reality reflected in the VIDA count will be part of her mission.
"I consider that a great priority, and that's been a focus for me as a young woman," she said. "I think it's extremely important not only for the counts, but to represent the world more fully and more exactly."
But Greenhouse also emphasized that this was "no wrecking ball moment," and that she envisioned the job as "a combination of stewardship and continuity and reinvigorating something."
Hederman said he began the search for Buruma's replacement intent on naming two editors, rather than one, but with no set idea about gender. "It could have ended up with two women, it could have been two men," he said. "We ended up with the best candidates."
Silvers and Epstein founded and built the magazine organically, making their chemistry a difficult thing to recreate. But Greenhouse and Winslow-Yost believe that their own longtime friendship, and most importantly the time they spent working together for Silvers, will help them share power.
"Working as an assistant at the Review is a tag-in, tag-out experience, and you necessarily establish a trust," Greenhouse said. "Gabe and I met eight years ago now, maybe longer, and we have a real trust in our relationship."
In separate interviews, both editors said they don't expect to divide the workload into distinct subject areas, aside from a few exceptions.
"He knows more about physics than I do," Greenhouse said.
"She speaks French, and I do not," Winslow-Yost said.
"But I would consider both of us generalists," Greenhouse said. "I think we will make decisions together." Greenhouse, who is expecting her first child next month, said the timing of the new job is "radically shocking" for her.
"Some things will sort themselves into one half of the head or the other, as we go," Winslow-Yost said. "But the idea is not to divide things into two camps, which is, as I understand, how Bob and Barbara did it. They had to agree on every piece that went in, even if it took weeks of hammering out."
Hederman said that Mendelsohn, in his role, would be in the office perhaps one day a week ("maybe more, that's up to him"), and that his longtime relationship with Silvers, the Review and many of the magazine's contributors could only help the younger co-editors as they begin their term.
"It's been hard," Winslow-Yost said of the time since Silvers's death. "The whole place was conceived around him; the way the physical space worked. All of that was based around the very idiosyncratic and not replicable way he worked. It's taken a while to learn how to function as a magazine without him there."
He went on to say that "one person can't do it in the way it needs to be done," and that the past five months without a top editor have been "an incredible period of people sharing responsibility" and a model for how things will look going forward.
Greenhouse said that some of the changes she envisions at the magazine are not radical but things that others, including The New Yorker, have done, like podcasts, newsletters, events and more outreach on college campuses.
A news release announcing the new editors also mentioned that the first prizes of the Robert B. Silvers Foundation will be awarded at the end of 2019. These prizes -- ranging in value from $15,000 to $30,000 -- are designed to support writers working on "in-depth political, social, economic and scientific commentary, long-form arts and literary criticism and the intellectual essay."

Texto completo: NEW YORK – Lawyers for Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán will seek a new trial after a report that jurors in his initial trial were following media coverage of the proceedings.
Guzmán attorney Eduardo Balarezo cited a Vice News report in which a juror said other members of the panel violated the repeated instructions of U. S. District Judge Brian Cogan by following news accounts of the trial on Twitter and other media outlets.
For Guzmán, who gained international notoriety for twice breaking out of high-security prisons in Mexico, the effort raises the possibility of at least a temporary escape from punishment in the United States.
The longtime leader of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel was convicted in Brooklyn federal court last week of drug trafficking, weapons violations and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The last charge could send Guzmán to prison for life.
"Mr. Guzmán intends to file a motion for a new trial based on the disclosures in the article and to request an evidentiary hearing to determine the extent of the misconduct," Balarezo wrote to Cogan on Friday.
More: After El Chapo: Sinaloa, other Mexican drug cartels still strong, and now diversifying
More: Federal jury finds drug lord Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán guilty of all counts
More: 'El Chapo' allegedly had sex with underage girls, called them his 'vitamins,' records show
More: El Chapo, wife, wear color-coordinated outfits as accused drug lord's mistress testifies
The defense team asked for more time to file a motion for a new trial. Under federal procedures, a defendant has 14 days from a conviction to file such a motion.
That put the deadline at Feb. 26. Cogan on Friday evening approved an extension to March 28.
The defense team said it asked federal prosecutors to consent to the extension but did not receive an answer before filing the letter to Cogan. The U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.
The jury of eight women and four men in the initial trial served anonymously amid tight security. They were brought to and from the Brooklyn federal courthouse each day by federal marshals.
The panel listened for nearly three months as prosecutors presented evidence that Guzmán reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in profits by smuggling tons of cocaine and other illegal drugs into the United States over decades.
Prosecutors called 56 witnesses, including 14 former Guzmán associates who provided a detailed inside look at the operations of the Sinaloa cartel and the role Guzmán played as leader.
Witnesses described an operation that smuggled drugs to U. S. cities in cars, trucks, trains, planes, submarines and tunnels under the Mexico-U. S. border. They described Guzmán using a cellphone security system to spy on associates and mistresses, as well as cursing and killing enemies – including one badly injured man that he ordered buried alive.
Guzmán did not testify in his own defense. His legal team called just one witness.
Cogan, mindful of intense national and international media coverage of the trial, ended each day's session by reminding jurors to avoid all news coverage and refrain from discussing the case with anyone.
The juror who spoke to Vice News described several jurors ignoring the judge's instructions and lying about it.
One development the jurors allegedly read about during the trial was an allegation by a former associate that Guzmán drugged and forced sex with girls as young as 13.
That evidence – including the claim that Guzmán referred to the girls as his "vitamins" –was not among the charges against him, and was not presented to jurors. It appeared in records that federal prosecutors unsealed and entered in the public docket of the Guzmán case days before the jury began deliberating.
After the media reported on the claims, Cogan questioned jurors in private to determine whether they had read or heard about the allegation, and, if so, whether it had affected their ability to render a fair and impartial verdict.
The judge said the jurors had reassured him that there had been no exposure or legal problems.
The juror quoted by Vice News said he or she had read an online account about the child rape allegation, and warned other members of the panel.
"If you saw what happened in the news, just make sure that the judge is coming in and he's gonna ask us, so keep a straight face. "
"So he did indeed come to our room and ask us if we knew, and we all denied it, obviously," the juror told Vice News. "We did talk about it. Jurors were like, you know, 'If it was true, it was obviously disgusting, you know, totally wrong. But if it's not true, whatever, it's not true. '"
The juror said the panel took six days to deliberate because one member held out, Vice News reported. The juror said some jurors were concerned over the possibility that Guzmán could spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement.
Guzmán's legal team, beaten during the trial by a mountain of prosecution evidence, seized on the development as a legal lifeline that could give the drug lord a new trial or other resolution.
Balarezo tweeted that the juror's claims, "if true, make it clear that Joaquín did not get a fair trial. "
If the verdict stands, Guzmán, 61, could spend the rest of his life locked in the Supermax federal prison in Florence, Colorado, the so-called Alcatraz of the Rockies.
High-security inmates there include Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols, federal Bureau of Prisons online records show.
Easy, instant access to information online has raised questions about jury misconduct and whether judges are able to stop it.
In 2010, Reuters Legal found that judges granted new trials or overturned verdicts in 28 criminal and civil cases for "alleged Internet-related juror misconduct" over the previous two years. Judges found Internet-related problems in roughly 75 percent of cases in which they did not take the drastic step of declaring mistrials.
The New York Times reported in 2009 that nine jurors in a major federal drug trial in Florida acknowledged that they had been doing Internet research about the case, violating legal rules and the trial judge's instructions. The judge declared a mistrial, wiping out eight costly weeks of legal work by prosecutors and defense lawyers.
When reports of juror misconduct allegations are raised in motions for a new trial or other legal relief, judges typically discuss the issues with attorneys from both sides and decide whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, which can questrions for the jury.
Case law shows that judges typically should determine whether any misconduct violations occurred and whether violations prevented defendants from receiving a fair trial.
In some cases, courts have ruled that evidence presented against the defendants outweighed any legal taint caused by juror misconduct.
For jurors, court findings of misconduct can result in sanctions, including potential contempt of court citations.
Questions about the Guzmán jurors' actions might provide a ray of legal hope for the drug lord, authorities presented him with new difficulties this week.
The Department of Justice on Thursday announced drug indictments against two of Guzmán's sons, Joaquín Guzmán Lopez and Ovidio Guzmán Lopez. They're charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana for importation into the United States.
The Guzmán brothers are believed to reside in Mexico. Federal prosecutors have not said publicly whether they would seek to extradite the brothers to the U. S. for trial, the same procedure that brought their father to trial.

Texto completo: "Green Book" is a symphony of vile anti-Italian stereotypes masquerading as a feel-good family film.
Of all the controversies surrounding director Peter Farrelly's movie, from questions about the script’s veracity to screenwriter Nick Vallelonga’s anti-Muslim tweet to Viggo Mortensen’s use of the N-word, this is the only row that has gone unnoticed.
Whereas Mahershala Ali’s Don Shirley is an erudite African-American pianist, Mortensen’s Tony “Lip” Vallelonga comes across as a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal whose surname ends in a vowel.
How ironic that the servile Italo-American chauffer’s heritage — which boasts the likes of Antonio Stradivari, Gioachino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, Enrico Caruso and Bartolomeo Cristofori (the inventor of, yes, the pianoforte) — is treated with undisguised contempt.
Despite “Green Book’s” formulaic buddy-flick denouement, many viewers will long remember Tony “Lip” as a loathsome vulgarian. For this, Mortensen earned a best actor nomination.

'A Star is Born': What the movie gets wrong about treatment for alcohol, opioid addiction
While the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has made great strides in repudiating racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, anti-Hispanic intolerance, Islamophobia and anti-Asian bigotry, Hollywood revels in the socially acceptable schadenfreude of Italophobia.
The Oscar-nominated films “BlacKkKlansman” and “Black Panther” depict noble, complex and courageous African-Americans. And Asian-Americans can point to “Crazy Rich Asians” with pride. But Italian-Americans are saddled with "The Godfather,” “Goodfellas,” “A Bronx Tale,” “Donnie Brasco, “Analyze This,” “The Untouchables, “Casino,” “Married to the Mob” and, now, "Green Book. "
Stepin Fetchit, Charlie Chan, Apu, and Mo and Josh Flatbush have shuffled off the entertainment coil. Yet the stereotype of the goombah — Italian-American slang for macho or gangster — abounds. And it has morphed into a billion dollar industry.
“Sopranos” creator David Chase’s “The Many Saints of Newark,” a prequel that introduces a young Tony Soprano and his gang of racist goons, is shooting this spring. Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” is slated to appear in theaters sometime this year. Despite the title, this Netflix movie features a bevy of brutish criminal goombahs.
In 1999, New York Times writer Clyde Haberman noted Hollywood’s institutionalized defamation of Italian-Americans: “Among major ethnic groups that have formed the country's social bedrock for at least a century, Americans of Italian origin may be the last to see themselves reflected in mass culture, time and again, as nothing but a collection of losers and thugs. You would be hard-pressed to tell from films and television shows that they have also been corporate leaders, governors and mayors, not to mention shopkeepers and working stiffs. ”
The scions of Italy are also Supreme Court justices, CIA directors, secretaries of State and Defense, astronomers, astronauts and Nobel Prize-winning physicists. And an Italian-American woman, Nancy Patricia D’Alesandro Pelosi, is the speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.
But this reality has largely eluded La La Land. Hollywood ignores the history of anti-Italian intolerance in America — from the mass lynching of Italians in New Orleans in 1891 to the internment and persecution of Italo-Americans as “enemy aliens” during World War II.
Ethnic slurs don't fly outside Hollywood
Upon arriving at a Hispanic Heritage Celebration in downtown Manhattan last Oct. 23, Janet DiFiore, chief judge of the Court of Appeals and of the state of New York, was greeted by court officers sporting T-shirts with the words, “Organized Crime Association. ” Michael Miller, president of the New York State Bar Association, confirmed that the slogan was indeed an offensive ethnic slur.
“Almost every other group one can name has successfully raised enough fuss whenever they feel their group is being stereotyped, defamed, maligned or otherwise besmirched for the media to get the message and cease doing it. But not when it comes to Italian-Americans,” columnist Adam Buckman wrote last month.
Filmmakers would be wise to fully embrace America’s national credo: “All men are created equal” — a concept Filippo Mazzei discussed with his Virginia friend and neighbor Thomas Jefferson, who made it a pillar of the Declaration of Independence. Our third president also recruited Sicilian musicians to professionalize the U. S. Marine Band in 1805.
And the Founding Fathers looked to an ancient Italian polity in creating our tripartite system of government. As historian Rufus Fears explained: "They crafted our Constitution to reflect the balanced Constitution of the Roman Republic. ” In fact, John Adams wrote that "the Roman Constitution formed the noblest people and the greatest power that has ever existed. ”
Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences should take heed.
Rosario A. Iaconis, an adjunct professor of economics at Suffolk County (New York) Community College, is chairman of The Italic Institute of America.

Texto completo: Misbehaving owners of sports teams have drawn headlines pretty much since sports have been around.
Now, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft faces misdemeanor charges of soliciting a prostitute after police said he was twice videotaped paying for a sex act at a massage parlor in Florida amid a crackdown on sex trafficking.
He joins a list of current and former NFL owners accused of crimes or social misconduct.
Last year, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson sold the team after allegations surfaced of sexual and racial misconduct in the workplace. Following a six-month investigation by the league, he was fined $2.7 million. Richardson, the team's founder, then sold the franchise to David Tepper for $2.2 billion.
Cleveland Browns owner Jim Haslam had legal troubles while CEO of Pilot Flying J, one of the nation's largest truck-stop chains. Company executives either pleaded guilty or were convicted in a fraud scheme worth more than $50 million. Haslam claimed he didn't know about the scheme in which customers were underpaid on promised rebates for fuel purchases, and he was not charged.
Haslam bought the Browns in October 2012, six months before the FBI and IRS raided company headquarters. The NFL never disciplined him.
Jim Irsay, whose Indianapolis Colts won a Super Bowl after the 2006 season under his leadership, acknowledged having a painkiller addiction in 2002 and sought treatment. The DEA investigated the case, but local prosecutors did not file charges.
Then, in March 2014, Irsay was arrested near his home in suburban Carmel and was held overnight after he failed sobriety tests and police found prescription medications in his car. The police said the drugs in Irsay's vehicle were not associated with any of the prescription bottles found inside. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, along with four felony counts of possession of a controlled substance; police also found $29,009 in cash.
He again sought treatment and in September 2014 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated, agreeing to undergo drug testing for a year. Irsay also admitted he was under the influence of the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone when he was arrested.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.
Ed DeBartolo Jr., who built the San Francisco 49ers' 1980s-90s dynasty with Bill Walsh as coach, was involved in one of the biggest scandals involving owners. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony when he paid $400,000 to former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in exchange for a riverboat gambling license.
DeBartolo was suspended from the NFL for one year in 1999 for his role in the gambling fraud scandal. He handed over control of the team to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and never returned to the 49ers.
Former Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose had to sell the team in 1985 to pay off more than $25 million in debts to Atlantic City casinos.
Football hardly stands alone in the owners' misbehavior market.
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was sued by former employees during the days of the Big Red Machine for being a racist. At one point, she was quoted in The New York Times as saying Adolf Hitler initially was good for Germany; that her use of racially inappropriate words was in jest; and that she didn't understand why certain ethnically insulting words were offensive.
In 1993, Schott was suspended for one year by Major League Baseball and fined $25,000 for language that MLB's executive council deemed "racially and ethnically offensive."
Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was fined $2.5 million and banned from the NBA for life in 2014 for racist comments he made to a friend. Sterling scolded her for posting pictures on Instagram in which she was accompanied by Basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, both black.
"Why are you taking pictures with minorities, why?" Sterling was recorded as saying. "Don't put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. ... And don't bring him to my games, OK? Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo, broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?"
The Rigas family owned the NHL's Buffalo Sabres in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was forced to relinquish control of the team after indictments on bank and security fraud charges for raiding the coffers of their cable company, Adelphia. The Sabres played the 2003-04 season under NHL operation before being purchased out of bankruptcy by Thomas Golisano.
Last year, NASCAR's Brian France, whose family owns the circuit and many of the tracks where it competes, was arrested in New York on charges of aggravated driving while intoxicated and criminal possession of a controlled substance. He immediately took a leave of absence, and his uncle, Jim France, stepped in as chairman and CEO.
Perhaps the most documented misbehavior by a franchise owner occurred with George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees.
A 15-count indictment was handed up in 1974 in Cleveland federal court for violations of election laws. Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions, then was suspended by commissioner Bowie Kuhn for two years. That suspension was lifted after 15 months for good behavior.
Steinbrenner frequently was fined for publicly criticizing umpires and for tampering.
He was forced to resign as the Yankees' managing general partner in 1990 for dealings with and a $40,000 payment to self-described gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner returned to his position March 1, 1993.

Learning What Makes a Good Job

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The photographer Christopher Payne has spent plenty of time in extraordinary workplaces for The New York Times Magazine: Recent gigs have taken him inside one of the last pencil factories in the United States and one of Latin America's most beloved candy factories. For this week's "Future of Work" issue, Mr. Payne took portraits of a special band of New Yorkers: those who really, really love their careers. He photographed nine people who have been at their jobs for decades -- sometimes 60 years or more -- and aren't sick of it yet. Together, he and I spoke to a doctor, a factory foreman and seven more devoted people at their places of work, trying to answer the issue's fundamental question: What makes a good job good?
Sure, the people in these jobs get to work early, stay late, spend eight-plus hours on their feet deboning chuck or lifting pianos. They dream of line ticker numbers being called in their sleep. But they also love what they do.
It's clear that the nine people whom Mr. Payne photographed and I interviewed are not in it for the money, or, at least, not the money alone. Leon Kalajian is a pleat maker who makes patterns and runs the machines and steamers that put folds -- pleats -- in fabric. He started helping in his family's pleating business when he was 6, and saw the business move from Lebanon to Damascus and back to Beirut before he moved to New York's garment district as an adult.
"In this country," Mr. Kalajian said, "I lost more than $ 5 million. Money again, again you can work. Again you can make it. Money is not, for me, like something that hurts me. At the end of the day, I make a living."
So what is it that these nine people have figured out about work and happiness? Some themes emerged: Start young; stay hungry; get to know your clientele better than you know members of your own family. Marry them, even. (A third of the people interviewed met their spouses on the job.)
And take satisfaction in a project done well. Terrell Elders, who works at the architectural hardware company P.E. Guerin, walked in looking for a summer job when he was an art student at Pratt. He later dropped out of art school, realizing that he was getting more out of making hardware like elaborate door knobs and pipe fixtures.
"It's like a project; it's like a jigsaw puzzle," he said. "It all comes together, and there's something very satisfying about that."
For some, it's about carrying on a tradition. Debbie Vasak started apprenticing at the World Trade Center as an Otis elevator mechanic in 1979, following in her father's footsteps. Her twin sister started at the same company a few months later: "We talk about elevators a lot at family functions," she said. (Ms. Vasak's son? He hopes to follow in her footsteps at Otis. )
Mr. Payne, the photographer, said he always kept an eye out for people whose work can be photographed in a way that speaks about the trade and what workers do, a craft and a particular skill set. "It's the natural, almost effortless relationship they have with what they're doing" that make them good subjects, he said. He was inspired by Prenta Ljucovic, who has been working at the Steinway Piano factory for 46 years. Ms. Ljucovic started working at the Steinway factory in 1973 when she was 22, just a month after emigrating from Yugoslavia. Her dream, when she retires, is to buy a piano that she helped make and teach herself to play. But most days, she just can't picture not coming to work.
In these conversations with workers, some of whom have been in their jobs for 60-plus years, the word "burnout" didn't come up once. Some worried that when they retired, their lives would slow down. Ms. Ljucovic said that to her, the work was like medicine -- you forget about your problems when you walk in the door.
Mr. Payne, who met Ms. Ljucovic in 2010 when he was working on a book about the Steinway factory, agrees. Trained as an architect, Mr. Payne didn't pick up a camera until he was 30. But he has been a professional photographer for the last 11 years. "As you get older, you start to realize that you're lucky you've found what you love to do, your calling, and you realize how precious time is, and you have a finite amount of time to do this work," he said.
"Everything just sort of clicks," he added. "40 years? It would be great to keep working at it."

Now, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft faces misdemeanor charges of soliciting a prostitute after police said he was twice videotaped paying for a sex act at a massage parlor in Florida amid a crackdown on sex trafficking.

Texto completo: "Green Book" is a symphony of vile anti-Italian stereotypes masquerading as a feel-good family film.
Of all the controversies surrounding director Peter Farrelly's movie, from questions about the script’s veracity to screenwriter Nick Vallelonga’s anti-Muslim tweets to Viggo Mortensen’s use of the N-word, this is the only row that has gone unnoticed.
Whereas Mahershala Ali’s Don Shirley is an erudite African-American pianist, Mortensen’s Tony “Lip” Vallelonga comes across as a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal whose surname ends in a vowel.
How ironic that the servile Italo-American chauffer’s heritage — which boasts the likes of Antonio Stradivari, Gioachino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, Enrico Caruso and Bartolomeo Cristofori (the inventor of, yes, the pianoforte) — is treated with undisguised contempt.
Despite “Green Book’s” formulaic buddy-flick denouement, many viewers will long remember Tony “Lip” as a loathsome vulgarian. For this Mortensen earned a Best Actor nomination.

While the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has made great strides in repudiating racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, anti-Hispanic intolerance, Islamophobia and anti-Asian bigotry, Hollywood revels in the socially acceptable schadenfreude of Italophobia.
The Oscar-nominated films “BlacKkKlansman” and “Black Panther” depict noble, complex and courageous African-Americans. And Asian Americans can point to “Crazy Rich Asians” with pride. But Italian Americans are saddled with "The Godfather,” “Goodfellas,” “A Bronx Tale,” “Donnie Brasco, “Analyze This,” “The Untouchables, “Casino,” “Married to the Mob” and, now, "Green Book. "
Stepin Fetchit, Charlie Chan, Apu and Mo and Josh Flatbush have shuffled off the entertainment coil. Yet the stereotype of the Goombah — Italian-American slang for macho or gangster — abounds. And it has morphed into a billion-dollar industry.
“Sopranos” creator David Chase’s “The Many Saints of Newark,” a prequel that introduces a young Tony Soprano and his gang of racist goons, is shooting this spring. Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” is slated to appear in theaters sometime this year. Despite the title, this Netflix movie features a bevy of brutish criminal Goombahs.
In 1999, New York Times writer Clyde Haberman noted Hollywood’s institutionalized defamation of Italian Americans: “Among major ethnic groups that have formed the country's social bedrock for at least a century, Americans of Italian origin may be the last to see themselves reflected in mass culture, time and again, as nothing but a collection of losers and thugs. You would be hard-pressed to tell from films and television shows that they have also been corporate leaders, governors and mayors, not to mention shopkeepers and working stiffs. ”
The scions of Italy are also U. S. Supreme Court justices, CIA directors, secretaries of State and Defense, astronomers, astronauts and Nobel Prize-winning physicists. And an Italian-American woman, Nancy Patricia D’Alessandro Pelosi, is the Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.
But this reality has largely eluded La La Land. Hollywood ignores the history of anti-Italian intolerance in America — from the mass lynching of Italians in New Orleans in 1891 to the internment and persecution of Italo-Americans as “enemy aliens” during World War II.
Ethnic slurs don't fly outside Hollywood
Upon arriving at a Hispanic Heritage Celebration in downtown Manhattan on Oct. 23, 2018, Janet DiFiore, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals and of the State of New York, was greeted by court officers sporting T-shirts with the words “Organized Crime Association. ” Michael Miller, president of the New York State Bar Association, confirmed that the slogan was indeed an offensive ethnic slur.
“Almost every other group one can name has successfully raised enough fuss whenever they feel their group is being stereotyped, defamed, maligned or otherwise besmirched for the media to get the message and cease doing it. But not when it comes to Italian Americans,” columnist Adam Buckman wrote last month.
Filmmakers would be wise to fully embrace America’s national credo: “All men are created equal” — a concept Filippo Mazzei discussed with his Virginia friend and neighbor Thomas Jefferson, who made it a pillar of the Declaration of Independence. Our third president also recruited Sicilian musicians to professionalize the U. S. Marine Band in 1805.
And the Founding Fathers looked to an ancient Italian polity in creating our tripartite system of government. As historian Rufus Fears explained: "They crafted our Constitution to reflect the balanced constitution of the Roman Republic. ” In fact, John Adams wrote that "The Roman constitution formed the noblest people and the greatest power that has ever existed. ”
Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences should take heed.

Texto completo: Peter Martins was supposed to have bowed out of New York City Ballet, the company he ran for 35 years.
But more than a year after he left amid allegations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse, he continues to make his presence felt in ways both big and small -- including by ordering last-minute cast changes in performances of his ballets and showing up backstage after a show.
Ashley Bouder, a star dancer, said Mr. Martins removed her at the 11th hour from the opening-night cast of "The Sleeping Beauty" -- a position she held for nearly a decade -- as retribution for publicly calling for a new day at the company.
"It completely blindsided me," Ms. Bouder said.
Contractually, living choreographers are given final approval in artistic decisions, including casting, and the right to go backstage after performances, though they typically yield to the wishes of management.
The abrupt change was jarring to Jonathan Stafford, the company's interim leader, who said he had thought the casting was "locked in." He said he was also upset when Mr. Martins defied his instructions to wait until the dancers had exited before going backstage after the first performance of "The Sleeping Beauty" last week.
"Unfortunately, he did not respect my wishes, even though I was crystal clear," said Mr. Stafford, a ballet master and former principal dancer. "I was as surprised as anybody," he added. "One dancer complained to me directly."
These sensitivities stem from the circumstances surrounding Mr. Martins's departure. He was the subject of multiple accusations of abuse, but an investigation commissioned by City Ballet's board did not corroborate those allegations, which former dancers and others had made in interviews with The New York Times and The Washington Post. That outcome divided the company, with some dancers sad to see Mr. Martins go and others upset that he had not been held to account.
Mr. Martins retains artistic say over his ballets, including "The Sleeping Beauty," now in performances, and "Romeo + Juliet," which was performed last February. Both had been programmed before Mr. Martins retired under pressure in January 2018.
He changed the casting for "The Sleeping Beauty" just before the roles were officially announced -- pulling Ms. Bouder from her usual position as Princess Aurora in the first cast and switching her with Sterling Hyltin in the third cast. He also swapped out several other dancers at the last minute. This has left some in the company bristling at Mr. Martins's remaining levers of control.
Casting decisions are always fraught in the dance world, given the intense competition for plum roles. And every City Ballet part is technically up for grabs, though certain important roles unofficially belong to particular dancers, who have owned them year after year in the first casts.
Sara Mearns, for example, leads the first cast in "Swan Lake," Megan Fairchild has "Coppélia," Ms. Hyltin has "Romeo + Juliet," and Ms. Bouder has "The Sleeping Beauty," which she danced for the first time at the age of 20 opposite Damian Woetzel.
Ms. Bouder said she believed that Mr. Martins made the casting change to retaliate for her outspokenness about feminism and gender equality and to reward Ms. Hyltin, who had publicly defended him.

"I feel like he is punishing me, even though he is not my boss anymore," Ms. Bouder said. "And by talking about it I can be punished even further. But that's a risk I have to take."
Mr. Stafford said that he would have been "happy to keep Ashley as first cast going forward" and that the current management team would rethink how casting is handled by living choreographers outside the company in the future. "It may need some adjusting to make sure the dancers' interests are protected," he said.
In Dance Magazine in April, Ms. Bouder called for the ballet world to embrace equal opportunity. She founded her own company, the Ashley Bouder Project, in 2014 to promote the work of women and other underrepresented voices in classical ballet.
When City Ballet was roiled again by accusations against three male dancers over vulgar texts about women, Ms. Bouder wrote last fall on Instagram: "Though this behavior was carried out by a few highly visible men alone, it was allowed to fester in our currently leaderless state. May we find a moral and fair individual to lead us out of this darkness and into future respect, integrity and success."
Mr. Martins declined through his friend Earle Mack, a former City Ballet trustee, to be interviewed for this article. "He's publicity shy," Mr. Mack said. Ms. Hyltin did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Mack also contested assertions that Mr. Martins's cast changes were punitive. "Balanchine recast his ballets all the time -- I don't think it's anything unusual," Mr. Mack said. "If Peter wants to do that, he wants to do that for the integrity of the ballet."
Even as City Ballet wrestles over its future relationship with Mr. Martins, the Balanchine Trust -- which licenses George Balanchine's work -- has given him a vote of confidence. The Trust recently approved a request by the Mariinsky Ballet (formerly the Kirov) in St. Petersburg, Russia, to have Mr. Martins oversee works by Balanchine, City Ballet's founding choreographer, whom Mr. Martins succeeded as ballet master in chief.
"This will open the door to him being the gatekeeper of Balanchine all over the world," said Mr. Mack, whose wife, Carol D. Mack, now serves on the board. "There is nobody better to oversee the Balanchine choreography than a man who's worked hand in hand with Balanchine and for 35 years has preserved that legacy."
When Yuri Fateev, the acting director of the Mariinsky, told the Balanchine Trust he wanted to engage Mr. Martins, "we all said, of course, go with it," said Barbara Horgan, 86, the Trust's longtime director. "Peter came to Balanchine in 1967, he is very familiar with the Balanchine repertory -- you can't take that away from him. He's a wonderful ballet master, and I think it's a wonderful idea. Why not? Let him spread the magic around a little bit."
"I'm devoted to Peter," she added. "What's he supposed to be, in purgatory for the rest of his life? Give me a break."
Not long after Mr. Martins's departure, City Ballet was convulsed yet again by allegations that three principal men, including Amar Ramasar, one of the company's biggest stars, had shared vulgar text messages. All three are gone from the company. (Mr. Ramasar is working again: This month he starred in Teatro dell'Opera di Roma's production of "Carmen." He also danced this week with Ballet Next at New York Live Arts.)
In the wake of all these troubles, Mr. Stafford said last fall that he was working to create "a more nurturing environment." The company's dancers spoke up, too, taking the stage at the fall gala to deliver a statement that said, in part: "We strongly believe that a culture of equal respect for all can exist in our industry. We will not put art before common decency, or allow talent to sway our moral compass."
In an interview, Ms. Bouder emphasized that she continues to support City Ballet and remains "very much a part of" the company. "Dealing with somebody like Peter -- who could be mean and could be a tyrant," she said, "how do you change that reality when it's been that way for so long?"
"I wish every woman could stand up and say, 'That isn't right,"' Ms. Bouder added. "Women, in particular, have been silenced for too long."

Airport renovations worth $1 billion?

Texto completo: The designs for a new Pittsburgh International Airport terminal are beautiful.
They are filled with light pouring in through huge windows. There are ceilings high enough to park an airliner in the concourse. There is enough greenery to give you the feeling you are visiting Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. It's practically a walk in the park...but not a long walk. Efforts have been made at making your airport jaunt as easy as possible, the designer assures.
But is it really necessary?
The $1.1 billion overhaul of the landside terminal -- to be paid by bonds and airline revenue -- has been two years in the designing and would be four years more in the execution. Rehab is set to start with the airside terminal this year, and when finished, the two would form one structure.
Admittedly, the terminal is getting a little long in the tooth. The current incarnation was unveiled in 1992, with a design the New York Times then heralded as the "airport of the future." The future apparently needs an update.
But recent attempts to subsidize carriers to provide new and different routes have sputtered and stalled. The Allegheny Airport Authority filed suit against OneJet after service collapsed, seeking to recover $763,000 of the $1 million laid out in gambling funds for the launch of 10 routes when only two came to pass. OneJet has since filed bankruptcy.
Then there were more subsidies to British Airways, WOW Air and Condor, all for European routes, that was followed by Delta announcing it was pulling back on its own Paris connections from Pittsburgh because of competition.
PIT traffic is up now, according to the authority, with 2018 a 12-year high. That clearly does merit investment to spur the growth. It's just a question of how much is a good business risk, and how much is about keeping up with the Joneses.
Tampa is in the midst of a $1 billion project, and Phoenix just renovated a terminal. Conde Nast puts both in the top ten best airports, along with Baltimore-Washington International -- where you can rent bikes -- and Portland -- which has a free movie theatre.
Being on that list would be great, just like it was when PNC Park was named among the country's best ballparks, but we must remember that having a great park still hasn't brought home a World Series. People will fly here for the destination, not the terminal.

Why Joe Biden shouldn't run for president

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.
Thus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.
The composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious front-runners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.
And their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the "moderate" with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: "Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams."
Then comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.
Also, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the "safe choice," the only person who will be able to withstand the president's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the president.
But is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.
Most problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.
Of course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the "inevitable" frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.
More important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the president's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve - with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.
With so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race - someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. "Uncle Joe" could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.
The Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee).
It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a recent article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Kenneth Frazier, CEO of pharma giant Merck, is set to face senators Tuesday who say drug costs are “sky-high” and “out of control.”
But Frazier doesn’t need new talking points. Sixty years ago, a different panel of senators grilled a different Merck boss about the same problem.
To a striking degree, the subjects likely to surface Tuesday — high drug prices and profits, limited price transparency, aggressive marketing, alleged patent abuse and mediocre, “me-too” drugs — are identical to the issues senators investigated decades ago, historical transcripts show.
Frazier is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee, led by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, along with the CEOs of AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Sanofi, and a top executive for Johnson & Johnson.
Hearings led by Sen. Estes Kefauver in 1959 and 1960 were the first significant congressional inquiry into rising drug costs and drug-company profits. While that showdown led to new legal standards for drug safety and effectiveness, cost-control measures never made it to the final bill.
Health policy scholars say the similar hearings show just how much unfinished business remains and how well pharma companies have protected profits and limited regulation over the years.
“Every decade since the Kefauver hearings has seen at least one set of congressional hearings into the increasing prices of prescription drugs,” said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a drug-industry historian at Johns Hopkins University.
“Drug prices, especially at the high end, are only ever higher” since the 1960s, said Dr. Scott Podolsky, a health care historian at Harvard Medical School. “The issues of transparency and profitability certainly have been there from the very first day of Kefauver.”
A Tennessee Democrat known for investigating the Mafia, Kefauver launched a series of hearings on business in the late 1950s. His Senate antitrust subcommittee began taking testimony on high pharmaceutical prices in late 1959.
“While this country has the best drugs in the world, it would appear from the great number of letters which the subcommittee has received that many of our citizens are experiencing difficulty in being able to purchase them,” Kefauver said in opening remarks.
The sessions, which lasted off and on until September 1960, were “among the most sensational” hearings of that Congress, a syndicated columnist wrote at the time. Appearing were the bosses of Merck, Pfizer, Schering, Bristol-Myers, Upjohn, Smith Kline and American Home Products. Senators dug into the prices of antibiotics, corticosteroids and tranquilizers, the wonder drugs of the time.
John Connor, then Merck’s president, said he had “deep sympathy” for people unable to afford medicine. So did Schering’s boss, but he said it wasn’t the industry’s fault.
“Undoubtedly some people find it difficult to pay for needed medication. They will also have difficulty in meeting their rent and food bills,” said Francis Brown, Schering’s president at the time. “It is a matter of inadequate income rather than excessive prices.”
The executives urged Congress to create government programs to help people pay for health care, which it did a few years later. Today Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies for private health coverage cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion annually.
But drugs are still unaffordable for many. A fourth of Americans in a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation said somebody in their family skipped doses or left prescriptions unfilled because medicine costs too much. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
Sixty years ago, as now, policymakers wondered why Americans pay so much more for medicine than people elsewhere.
“I still don’t understand why druggists in London buy this drug for $7.53 and our drugstores have to pay $17.90,” Kefauver told Connor, the Merck executive.
“We meet different market conditions in different countries,” was Connor’s response. Americans were getting “a reasonable bargain,” he said. “Merck’s Head Defends Drug Prices” was the front-page headline the next day in The New York Times.
Senators accused companies of marking up the cost of drugs by thousands of percent. Then as now, executives defended high profits as necessary to finance research and development, even though they often spent more on ads and marketing than R&D.
“They were advised that whenever the senators mentioned high prices, just mention research and how difficult it is, how expensive it is,” said Donald Light, a health policy professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. “Since 1959, that is the repeated and successful theme of Big Pharma.”
“The few successful products have to pay for the hundreds of research failures,” Alvin Brush, president of American Home Products, told Kefauver’s committee.
Like those of today, patients of 1960 were baffled about what medicine cost until they got the bill. Such obscurity led to overpayment.
“The consumer, in this field, cannot exercise his normal, economic prerogative of shopping or pricing before a purchase,” the head of a generic-drug manufacturer told the committee. “The normal laws of supply and demand have no application here.”
Drug companies engaged in a “pharmaceutical numbers racket” by promoting different strengths of established drugs as new medicine and charging more, Louis Lasagna, a pharmacology professor from Johns Hopkins University, told the committee.
“Now this is like saying that a dime is more potent than two nickels because you can use one coin instead of two,” he said.
Companies often worked not to develop breakthrough medicine but to take an existing product and “modify the original drug just enough to get a patentable alternative,” said Dr. Frederick Meyers, a pharmacology professor at what later became the University of California-San Francisco.
In contrast to the nonstop consumer TV commercials of today, ads for prescription medicines in 1960 were aimed at doctors and hospitals, appearing in medical journals. Even those were deemed aggressive. A committee staffer dumped out a huge pile of samples, ads and flyers that a Minnesota doctor said he had received in only one month.
Maybe if the companies spent less on ads, armies of salesmen and “expensive stock options” for executives, Kefauver suggested, “you could lower the price of drugs, too.”
Senators proposed sweeping solutions.
Kefauver’s draft bill would have withheld patents for modified drugs unless the new molecule gave a therapeutic response “significantly greater” than the original. It would have promoted competition by allowing anybody to license and sell a patented drug, in return for royalties paid to the patent holder, after three years.
One expert urged the government to publish an official list of patented drugs and their generic equivalents along with prices so everybody could see what they cost.
None of this happened. The industry fought back. Any legislation seemed doomed until the tragedy of thalidomide, a pill taken for morning sickness that produced deformities in babies, prompted lawmakers to act.
But the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962, which set requirements for medical trials and laid ground for the modern drug-approval process, did little to control cost.
There was no need to limit drug prices, Austin Smith, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told the Kefauver committee. Attempts to prove excessive pharma profits were “doomed to failure,” he said. Drug prices were rising more slowly than consumer prices generally, Smith said.
Smith’s counterpart today is Stephen Ubl, who runs what is now known as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. He takes a similar line, one that is likely to be repeated on Tuesday. “Drug prices are rapidly decelerating,” Ubl tweeted last month.

Sex in New York parks droops as amorous incidents decline by 98 percent

Texto completo: New York City parks are no longer hotbeds for sex in the city, according to a new report.

"We're not getting calls from the community for people having sex in the park," police inspector Raymundo Mundo, who heads the 34th Precinct in Upper Manhattan told the New York Times about New York's Fort Tryon Park. "It's not that we're choosing to ignore or look the other way. It's just not happening. And we do patrol on a daily basis."

President of Marcus Garvey Park Alliance Connie Lee concurs that parks are getting less action: "It's not the hub of sexual activity that it once was."

Although more than 400 "sex in park" tickets were written up by New York City police officers in 2007, only six were written in 2018, police department information shows. Additionally, New York’s 311 "Citizen's Hotline" has received fewer complaints than it did less than a decade ago: the hotline received 483 complaints of lewd acts in 2013, in comparison to 283 in 2018.

Arrests for public sex are also declining. According to the New York Police Department, almost 700 arrests were made in 2010 and approximately 470 were made in 2018.

Phil Walzak, New York City Police Department's top spokesman, identified several reasons for the drop, such as new policing strategies and fewer complaints. He said the downturn in complaints was "probably driven by fewer overall occurrences."

Over the last 10 years, areas including Central Park and the Inwood neighborhood in Manhattan, where Fort Tryon Park is located, were among some of the highest areas police distributed "sex in park" tickets — which is accompanied by a $100 fine. Police officers must see the deed themselves in order to issue a fine.

"You walk through the park and see a guy leaning against a tree: What crime is being committed there?" Officer Bryan Polster, who is assigned to an area that includes Fort Tryon Park, told the New York Times. "Just to be meeting someone in the park is not a crime. And I think that's why the complaints are nonexistent."

Even so, the New York Times reports that condoms can be found on the ground and in the bushes of parks like Fort Tryon — suggesting some still engage in sexual activity in public parks.

Texto completo: Como de si de una telenovela se tratara, Emily Zamora está demandando al padre de su hijo, el magnate Mark Gorton, quien la abandonó al descubrir que había mentido sobre sus orígenes humildes.
Ahora Zamora está solicitando $37,500 dólares mensuales para la manutención de su hijo de 4 meses, incluyendo $9 mil para la niñera.
Gorton (52) es el creador del servicio de intercambio de música LimeWire y ha invertido millones de dólares en el grupo de ciclismo profesional Transportation Alternatives.
Los abogados de Zamora (23) dicen que su ex-amante millonario, que le dobla la edad y es educado en las prestigiosas universidades Harvard, Yale y Stanford, la abandonó después de enterarse de que proviene de una familia trabajadora.
“Emily es una niña joven e ingenua y estaba avergonzada de sus orígenes”, reconoció su abogado Raoul Felder a New York Post después de una comparecencia ayer ante el tribunal en Manhattan.
Allí Zamora exigió que los pagos de manutención infantil de Gorton se incrementaran de $6 mil a $37,500 dólares al mes.
Después de conocerse a través de un sitio de citas en línea, Zamora afirmó falsamente a Gorton que su madre había asistido a Harvard, pero en realidad es una cocinera en un restaurante italiano en Texas, mientras que su padre es un empleado de correos.
Gorton contrató a alguien para investigar a la joven y descubrió que le había mentido.
En la corte, los abogados de Gorton pintaron a Zamora como a una cazafortunas. Su abogado admitió que “es una mentirosa. No se trata de ser pobre. Es sólo que una mentirosa no llega a ser recompensada por las mentiras que dijo y exige millones de dólares en manutención infantil”, dijo Eric Wrubel al juez Michael Katz.
Mientras tanto, el juez regañó a Zamora por haber llevado al bebé de la pareja a la corte. “Estás utilizando al niño (…) En el futuro, no puedes traerlo para desfilar frente a la prensa”.
La joven madre afirmó que no había podido encontrar a nadie que vigilara al bebé.
Además de LimeWire, Gorton posee la firma de servicios financieros Tower Research Capital LLC. Y a “Transportation Alternatives” le ha regalado más de $10 millones de dólares desde 2002, según The New York Times.
Katz no emitió un fallo en el caso ayer y prometió hacerlo en una fecha posterior.

NYPD ya casi no multa por sexo público en los parques de la ciudad

Texto completo: NYPD escribió 432 multas en 2007 por lo que se conoce como “sexo en el parque”, según cifras oficiales. El año pasado apenas hubo 6.
No sólo han bajado las multas, sino que menos neoyorquinos están llamando al 311 para denunciar actos lascivos en público . En 2013 hubo 483 quejas; el año pasado, 283.
NYPD registró un poco más de 470 delitos menores de arresto por indecencia pública el año pasado, frente a casi 700 en 2010. Las violaciones denunciadas han aumentado en otros sitios, como el Metro, pero las de parques son cada vez más raras.
Según The New York Times, el declive de ambas cifras plantea preguntas obvias: ¿la policía está siendo más tolerante y/o los neoyorquinos han perdido su sentido de lujuria o voyerismo? ¿El Departamento de Policía ha cambiado o los ciudadanos?
La respuesta puede ser una combinación de factores: los parques de la ciudad son más seguros y están más llenos, con visitantes recorriendo incluso algunos espacios apartados; y los oficiales de policía también están buscando cada vez más resolver los problemas sin recurrir a arrestos o multas.
Las cinco áreas con la mayoría de multas por “sexo en el parque” en los últimos 10 años fueron Inwood/Washington Heights; Central Park; Morningside Heights; Forest Park en Queens; y un área de Flushing que contiene Kissena Park y otros.
Los actos sexuales, considerados una violación de las reglas de los parques públicos, actualmente conllevan una multa de $100 dólares , y deben ser presenciados por un oficial de policía, quien procederá entonces a realizar el informe.
Phil Walzak, principal portavoz de NYPD, citó una serie de factores para explicar el declive, incluida una mejor coordinación con el Departamento de Parques, las nuevas filosofías policiales y el declive de las quejas, que según él “probablemente se debió a un menor número de casos en general”.
“No veo ninguna evidencia de que el sexo en público se haya reducido; ciertamente no se ha acabado”, opinó por su parte Duncan Osborne, editor asociado de Gay City News. “La policía puede haber cambiado su comportamiento. Pero no creo que los chicos hayan cambiado su comportamiento. Mira, a algunos chicos les gusta” el sexo público por diversas razones, tanto de preferencia como por falta de opciones para citarse en privado o miedo a los prejuicios.

Texto completo: Peter Tork, a blues and folk musician who became a teeny-bopper sensation as a member of the Monkees, the wisecracking, made-for-TV pop group that imitated and briefly outsold the Beatles, died Feb. 21. He was 77.
His death was confirmed by his sister Anne Thorkelson, who did not say where or how he died. Tork was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare cancer affecting his tongue, in 2009.
If the Monkees were a manufactured version of the Beatles, a "prefab four" who auditioned for a rock 'n' roll sitcom and were selected more for their long-haired good looks than their musical abilities, Tork was the group's Ringo, its lovably goofy supporting player.
A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Tork mostly played bass and keyboard for the Monkees.
At 24, he was also the band's oldest member when "The Monkees" premiered on NBC in 1966. Not that it mattered: "The emotional age of all of us," he told The New York Times that year, "is 13."
Created by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, "The Monkees" was designed to replicate the success of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" - director Richard Lester's musical comedies about the Beatles.
The band featured Tork alongside Michael Nesmith, a singer-songwriter who played guitar, and former child actors Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who played the drums and sang lead, respectively.
"The Monkees" ran for only two seasons but won an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy. In 1967, according to one report in The Washington Post, the Monkees sold 35 million albums - "twice as many as the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined" - on the strength of songs such as "Daydream Believer," "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to Clarksville," which all rose to No. 1 on the Billboard record chart.
While the band scored a total of six Top 10 songs and five Top 10 albums, it engendered as much critical scorn as commercial success.
Detractors pointed to the fact that the band, at least initially, existed only in name. While the Monkees appeared on the cover of their debut album and were shown performing on TV, their instruments were unplugged. The songs were mostly done by session musicians - much to the shock of Tork.
After the release of the band's second album, "More of the Monkees" (1967), Tork and his bandmates wrested control of the recording process. They also started touring, playing to sold-out stadium crowds and backed by opening acts that briefly included guitarist Jimi Hendrix.
But as Tork's musical ambitions grew, and he began to clash with bandmates who saw the Monkees as more of a novelty act. He left the group soon after the release of "Head," a satirical, nearly plot-free film flop that featured a screenplay co-written by actor Jack Nicholson.
For much of the 1970s, Tork struggled to find his own way. He formed an unsuccessful band called Release, was imprisoned for several months in 1972 after being caught with "$3 worth of hashish in my pocket," and worked as a high school teacher and "singing waiter" as his Monkees wealth dried up. He said he struggled with alcohol addiction before quitting in the early 1980s.
By then, television reruns and album reissues had fueled a resurgence of interest in the Monkees, and Tork had come around to what he described as the essential nature of the music group, which he joined for major reunion tours about once a decade, beginning in the mid-'80s. Tork also performed during that time as a solo artist.
Tork's marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his sister, survivors include his wife, Pamela Grapes, two daughters, a son and a brother.

Presidential historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham will be the guest speaker for the 26th annual R. Dan Boulware Convocation on Critical Issues at Missouri Western State University this fall.
His speech, “The Soul of America: Moving Beyond Division and Hostility,” will be at 10 a.m. Thursday, Sept. 26, in the Looney Complex Arena. Meacham also will be the featured guest at the annual convocation luncheon at noon Sept. 26 in the Fulkerson Center. Ticketing information for the luncheon will be announced at a later date.
“Division and acrimony in our public discourse is a problem facing our country today that should concern all of us, and I have wanted to address this problem as a critical issue in our convocation series,” said Dan Boulware, former president of the Missouri Western Board of Regents for whom the speaker series is named. “I heard Jon Meacham speak in San Antonio last year. He enthralled the audience. I realized then that he would be an excellent choice to address this compelling issue. I am pleased and excited we have been able to secure him as our convocation speaker this year and I believe this has the potential for being one of our very best convocations. He is a terrific speaker and has a compelling message.”
A contributor to TIME and The New York Times Book Review , Meacham regularly appears on CNN and MSNBC.
His latest No. 1 New York Times bestseller, “The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,” examines the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in U.S. history when hope overcame division and fear. Meacham is also a co-author of the recently released book, “Impeachment: An American History,” which reveals the complicated motives behind the three presidential impeachments in U.S. history.
Meacham’s presidential biography, “Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,” debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times bestsellers list. Meacham delivered eulogies for both President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush.
Other bestsellers include “Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power,” “Franklin and Winston,” “American Gospel” and “American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,” which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2009.
Missouri Western inaugurated the R. Dan Boulware Convocation on Critical Issues program in 1993. Previous Convocation speakers include Bill Bradley, Douglas Brinkley, James Carville and Mary Matalin, Sam Donaldson, Steve Forbes, Thomas Friedman, David Gergen, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Newt Gingrich, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Martin Luther King III, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jerry Linenger, David McCullough, Joseph Nye, T.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that an American woman who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA TODAY with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha sido cuestionado sobre sus intentos de intervenir o detener de algún modo la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Esta semana, el New York Times hizo algunas revelaciones al respecto, aunado a declaraciones del exdirector interino del FBI, Andrew McCabe , sobre lo que motivó el inicio de las indagatorias: el despido de James Comey , exdirector del FBI.
1. Sospechas de injerencia.- A finales de 2018, el presidente Trump le preguntó al entonces fiscal general en funciones, Matthew Whitaker , si un abogado que él nombró podría supervisar una investigación relacionada con él mismo, luego de que el fiscal ya se había retirado de la investigación, informó el Times, que citó a varios funcionarios estadounidenses con conocimiento directo de la llamada. Esto es considerado como una forma de injerencia en la investigación.
2. Ataque a investigaciones.- Un conteo de ese diario reveló que el presidente Trump ha atacado al menos 1,2000 veces la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016. El reporte, hecho en un sistema de visualización, incluyen declaraciones hechas en Twitter, en discursos oficiales, en mítines y durante entrevistas con medios de comunicación y otros eventos de prensa. Esto significa que el mandatario ha cuestionado las indagatorias al menos una vez durante 330 días.
3. ¿Un activo ruso?.- El exdirector interino del FBI, McCabe, dijo que es posible que el presidente Trump sea un activo ruso. “¿Todavía cree que el presidente podría ser un activo ruso?” , preguntó a Anderson Cooper de CNN. “Creo que es posible. Creo que es por eso que comenzamos nuestra investigación, y estoy realmente ansioso por ver dónde (el fiscal especial Robert) Mueller concluye eso”, dijo McCabe. Es otro comentario explosivo de McCabe, que se produce días después de que describió las razones por las que los principales funcionarios de Estados Unidos decidieron abrir una investigación de contrainteligencia y una investigación por obstrucción de la justicia en el presidente Trump.
El recién ratificado fiscal federal, William Barr , indicó que es posible que la siguiente semana Mueller entregue algún reporte de las indagatorias que inició en 2017 y que han derivado en acusaciones a excolaboradores cercanos del presidente Trump, como su exabogado personal, Michael Cohen .

Arms control advocates: Heed lessons from '80s

Texto completo: On February 2, the Trump Administration began the six-month process that will lead to withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed with the Soviet Union in 1987.
Vladimir Putin's Russia has been violating the agreement for at least a decade, having tested and deployed as many as one-hundred 9M729 missiles that can fly in the range of 300 to 3,400 miles the terms of the INF prohibit. These weapons threaten both Western Europe and the Mideast. The Administration believes the U.S. needs the freedom to develop its own intermediate missile technology to counter threats both from Russia and eventually from China.
Despite Moscow's denials, no responsible official in the U.S. or Europe disagrees that Russia is in violation of the treaty. Nonetheless, ten senators, including Bernie Sanders and presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand, are co-sponsoring the Prevention of Arms Race Act of 2019, a bill designed to pre-empt Administration action. The New York Times editorialized that "saving the treaty may be a long shot ... But the Trump administration has an obligation to try."
It might be instructive for the advocates of "negotiate first" to recall how the 1987 INF Treaty came about, and the posture the U.S. assumed over the preceding decade.
In 1977, after committing to strategic parity with the U.S. by freezing intercontinental missile deployment in the 1972 SALT I Treaty, the Soviet Union immediately sought to alter that balance by deploying on its territory intermediate range SS-20 missiles. They carried multiple warheads and menaced Western Europe, the Mideast, parts of Asia and Alaska.
West Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was the first NATO ally to demand the Carter administration counter the threat. The response was the December 1979 "Double-Track" decision: NATO would deploy 108 Pershing II missiles in West Germany and 464 Ground Launched Cruise Missiles elsewhere in Europe by the end of 1983. At the same time, the U.S. offered to open negotiations with the Soviets designed to limit intermediate range weapon deployment.
Formal negotiations began in the fall of 1981. That November, Ronald Reagan made his sweeping "zero-zero" offer: the U.S. would cancel deployment of all its Pershing II's and GLCM's if the Soviets would eliminate their SS-20's. That was too much for Moscow to stomach and NATO's Pershing and GLCM deployment plans went ahead.
The disarmament community rose up in arms. There was a huge protest in Central Park, and anti-missile demonstrations swept Europe. But Reagan, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Schmidt's successor as Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, hung tough. Deployment began in November of 1983 the Soviets walked out of the talks. One notable supporter of NATO's hard line was the Socialist President of France, Francois Mitterrand.
Mikhail Gorbachev's 1985 ascent as Soviet First Secretary brought renewed Soviet interest in negotiations; the Soviets finally acceded to Reagan's "zero-zero" principle and signed the INF Treaty at the Washington summit of December 1987. A bilateral pact, it eliminated the entire class of intermediate weapons, and nearly 2,700 of them, U.S. and Soviet, were destroyed.

Texto completo: Serena Williams, who has as much impact off the tennis court as on it these days, is headed to Hollywood next. Or, at least, to a celebration of Hollywood.
The world-renowned athlete, who recently appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Bumble and made a surprise cameo on "Lip Sync Battle" last month to reprise her role from the 2016 music video for Beyoncé's "Sorry," will be one of the eight non-actors to present at the Oscars on Sunday, the New York Times reported.
Williams, 37, will introduce "A Star is Born," while seven other celebrities will each take on one of "Black Panther," "BlacKkKlansman," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "The Favourite," "Green Book," "Roma" and "Vice."
"Along with inclusion, which we definitely want to embrace, the big theme of the show is about movies connecting us -- not in this theater but in a big, sweeping, cultural way," Donna Gigliotti, the lead producer of the Academy Awards, told the New York Times.
"There are so many things to balance. Some viewers want to see glamour. You have to pay attention to where there is humor and where there is music. When do we guess that people at home might get up to make popcorn in the kitchen, and what can we have on right after that to bring them back?"
The other seven presenters have not been announced and a spokesperson for the Academy did not return a request for comment.
The 2019 Oscars have already seen a laundry list of changes -- but few that have stuck -- as the annual awards show aims for a return to legitimacy.
The ceremony will go without a host for the first time in 30 years after Kevin Hart stepped down following backlash for homophobic tweets that resurfaced online.
Plans for a "popular film" category were also quickly scrapped after criticism that the award was announced so 'Black Panther" could be recognized without the Academy having to give its top trophy to a superhero movie.
The most recent controversy, however, came when the Academy announced intentions to eliminate four categories -- cinematography, film editing, live action short and makeup and hairstyling -- from the live telecast in order to cut time from the three-plus-hour broadcast.
But stars, including Brad Pitt, Kerry Washington, Emma Stone, Spike Lee, George Clooney, Alfonso Cuarón and dozens more protested, signing an open letter that blasted the decision.
"Since its inception, the Academy Awards telecast has been altered over time to keep the format fresh, but never by sacrificing the integrity of the Academy's original mission," they wrote.
"When the recognition of those responsible for the creation of outstanding cinema is being diminished by the very institution whose purpose it is to protect it, then we are no longer upholding the spirit of the Academy's promise to celebrate film as a collaborative art form."
The Academy relented and reversed its decision.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is considering four people to be his next United Nations ambassador: Goldman Sachs Group partner Dina Powell; the current ambassadors to Canada and Germany, Kelly Craft and Richard Grenell, respectively; and John James, a former Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter.
The people asked not to be identified because Trump hasn't made a decision. Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination to replace Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn't authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Powell is a veteran of the Trump administration who served as a deputy national security adviser before returning to Goldman Sachs last year. Craft was deeply involved in Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and is married to Joe Craft, a billionaire Republican fundraiser and executive at coal producer Alliance Resource Partners.
Grenell manages the U.S. relationship with the German government, which has grown tense because of a variety of conflicts, including the president's consideration of tariffs on imported cars.
James fell short in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last year.
No plan for Smollett to do follow-up police interview
CHICAGO - Attorneys for "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans Monday for him to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview that police have requested about his reported assault.
Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She said in an emailed statement that his lawyers "will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."
Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in "MAGA Country."
Police said Saturday that the investigation had "shifted" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.
Smollett's lawyers said the actor feels "victimized" by reports that he played a role in the assault.
New York City guidelines take aim at hairstyle discrimination
NEW YORK - New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
The New York Times reported that they are believed to be the first such measure nationwide.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hair nets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.
Roger Stone posts photo of judge with cross-hairs symbol
NEW YORK - Roger Stone criticized the federal judge overseeing his criminal case on Monday, blasting her as a partisan appointee of President Barack Obama and posting a photo of her face featuring what appeared to be a cross-hairs symbol.
The embattled confidant to President Donald Trump posted the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Instagram but quickly deleted it after the New York Daily News asked him about the apparent rifle scope symbol in the left hand corner.
Stone, who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation last month, claimed he "didn't notice the symbol" on the photo that he said he got off the Internet.
Stone deleted the photo and replaced it with one cropping out the cross-hairs.
Mexico to close infamous island penal colony
MEXICO CITY - Mexico will close a famed island penal colony off the country's Pacific coast and convert it into a cultural and environmental education center, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday.
The federal prison on the largest of the Islas Marias will release about 200 of its approximately 600 inmates and the rest will be relocated to other prisons.
The prison founded in 1905 on Maria Madre passed through periods of infamous brutality. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias was the last one remaining in the Americas.
He noted that the last riot there occurred in 2003 because it was over capacity. At that time there were 8,000 prisoners there, he said.
The island is about 70 miles off the coast of Nayarit state.
Oakland Diocese names 45 accused of sexual abuse
OAKLAND, Calif. - The Catholic Diocese of Oakland has released the names of 45 priests, deacons and religious brothers who officials say are "credibly accused" of sexually abusing minors.
The San Francisco Chronicle said Monday that Oakland's list goes back to 1962 - when the diocese was founded. None of the men are currently in the ministry. Of the 45 people named, 20 were priests.
Oakland is the latest in a series of dioceses across the country to release names amid a scandal involving pedophile priests and decades of church cover-ups.
Most of the listed abuse dates from the 1960s into the 1980s. Diocese officials say there have been no credible accusations of abuse since 1988, but acknowledge that the list may grow in the coming months.
In Bolivia: A passenger bus crashed head-on with a dump truck in southern Bolivia on Monday, killing at least 24 people and injuring 12 more, police said.
The accident occurred in a dense fog about 135 miles south of the capital, La Paz. Two buses collided on the same highway in January, killing 22 people.
In Britain: British border officials have picked up 34 people thought to be migrants who were trying to cross the English Channel in a small boat. The Home Office said their nationalities were unknown, but they were taken ashore for interviews Monday while three men were arrested for suspected immigration offenses.

Texto completo: UPPER NYACK – Jefferson Crowther, the father of 9/11 hero Welles Crowther, known as "the man in the red bandanna," died Feb. 13. He was 73.
The cause was prostate cancer, said Alison Crowther, his wife of 47 years. He is also survived by his daughters, Honor Fagan and Paige Charbonneau, and their families.
Jeff and Alison Crowther repeatedly shared their son's story of heroism on Sept. 11, 2001, to inspire leadership and character development. They helped establish the Red Bandanna Project and a family foundation, the Welles Remy Crowther Charitable Trust, toward that mission.
"He was a great protector," Alison Crowther said. "He was always taking care of me and our family, a wonderful father and husband. He was a gentleman with a wonderful sense of humor, which is what attracted me to him. He was very funny."
A father's inspiration Jeff Crowther was his son's inspiration for joining the fire service that provided the training to save so many during the 2001 terrorist attacks, and for carrying the red bandanna that came to symbolize his heroism.
Welles had joined his father as a volunteer firefighter at Upper Nyack's Empire Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.
The kerchief tradition was established when Welles was just 7. One day before church, Welles asked if he could have a handkerchief like the one his father had, a white pocket square in his coat pocket.
The elder Crowther came back with a pocket square, but also with a red bandanna. He pointed to the white one: "That's for show," he said. Then, pointing to the red bandanna, he said: "This is for blow, to blow your nose."
From that day on, Welles was never without his red bandanna. (Jeff preferred a blue bandanna.)
On Sept. 11, as the World Trade Center's South Tower filled with smoke and fire, Welles, who worked as an equities trader on the 104th floor, covered his face with a red bandanna as he led others through smoke and fire, and down the only working stairwell. He is credited with saving the lives of at least 10 people. The last anyone saw of him, he was preparing to rush back up that staircase. His body was eventually found at the FDNY command center in the South Tower lobby, with the remains of other firefighters.
Jeff Crowther later said when he was going through Welles' belongings after his death, he found an application for the FDNY.
A bond ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi got to know Jeff and Alison Crowther when he wrote "The Man in the Red Bandanna," a 13-minute TV piece for ESPN about Welles. Rinaldi then expanded it into a 2016 book of the same name.
Rinaldi said Jeff Crowther and his son had "the bond we as fathers all hope for."
"We dream that two things happen: That, as they age, they make us proud, and that they grow from son to friend. And both those things happened between Jefferson and Welles," Rinaldi said.
Boston College, Welles' alma mater, would embrace his legacy with an annual Red Bandanna football game. Rinaldi said Jeff's locker room visits at those games meant the world to him.
"Seeing Jeff talking to those young men, there is such joy and pride in his voice," Rinaldi said. "I think those were some of the richest, greatest moments in his life, after having lost Welles, because I think he felt like he was looking at other young men that he hoped would be like his son, would embody his values, would be living, breathing reflections of his only son."
Show of strength Jeff Crowther did not hide his pain from the loss of his son.
"He said things that people remember to this day, like: 'I still weep every day for my son. I just miss the pleasure of his company.' That hits everyone," Rinaldi said.
Rinaldi also recalls how Crowther didn't hold back his tears; he let them flow.
"I think of the courage it took for Jeff to share his emotion, to share the pain and loss with the world," he said. "There are so many times where, as fathers, as men, we're told that we need to be invulnerable, and never to show sorrow and grief let alone share that grief in such a raw, powerful and enduring way. And he did that."
But Rinaldi said Crowther was by no means a broken man.
"He was a man who continued to be a great father to his daughters and then a grandfather to his grandchildren. He continued to embrace life. He had a tremendous sense of humor. He had great sports passions. He continued his life even though there was this enormous hole in his heart. If that's not strength, I don't know what is."
Early life Jefferson Crowther was born Aug. 30, 1945, weeks after the end of World War II.
He grew up in White Plains, the son of Florence and Bosley Crowther. His father was film critic for The New York Times from 1940 to 1967. His mother was influential in creating Ridgeway Elementary School in the growing suburb.
Crowther graduated from The George School, a Quaker prep school in Pennsylvania, and earned a business degree from New York University. He served in the U.S. Navy, and was later a member of American Legion Post 310 in Nyack.
He went into banking in Manhattan, where he worked for Chemical Bank, Bank of New York, US Trust and, finally, Sterling National. He retired July 31, 2018. He had been in struggling health for years, his wife said, from metastatic prostate cancer.
The couple, who met on a blind date on Sept. 11, 1968 — an anniversary that would come to mean something very different 33 years later — married on May 1, 1971. They first lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, where he became a Manhattan banker and she was a research assistant at Rockefeller University. They would eventually move to Chappaqua, Pomona and then to Upper Nyack.
A sense of duty Crowther joined Upper Nyack's Empire Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 in November 1985. He would serve as the company's treasurer and chaplain.
"He was the tillerman on the truck," his wife said, of the firefighter who steers the back of the long ladder truck. "It was a huge responsibility."
He had grown up around tillermen of a different sort, sailing the Long Island Sound and off Martha's Vineyard, where his family spent summers.
"He wanted to be buried in his Empire Hook and Ladder uniform," his wife said. "And his his grandson, Beckett Jefferson Fagan, who is named for him, made a little friendship bracelet for his grandfather. He wore it till the moment he died."
A wake will be held from 4-8 p.m.Monday, Feb. 18, at Hannemann Funeral Home, 88 S. Broadway, Nyack. Empire Hook & Ladder will hold a firematic service at 7 p.m. at the funeral home. A memorial service takes place at 11 a.m. Friday, Feb. 22, at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave., Nyack.
The family is asking for donations in Jefferson Crowther's memory be made to the Welles Remy Crowther Charitable Trust, P.O. Box 780, Nyack, NY 10960.
The name of Welles Remy Crowther, known as "the man in the red bandanna," is on the 9/11 Memorial in New York.

Texto completo: So excruciating were the acceptance speeches at Sunday night's Grammy Awards that Trevor Noah compared them to irritating people who wait in line at Chipotle, "get to the front and go, 'uh ...'"
Noah was right. The Grammys were enough to make you dread the Oscars. These are dire days for the fine art of the acceptance speech.
In almost every case at the Grammys, the speeches were too long -- in the case of Drake, way too long -- poorly prepared (if they were prepared at all), self-serving, rambling, boring, emotionally hyperbolic, repetitive and, in many cases, entirely improvisational. And most musicians aren't graduates of Second City.
A speech actually requires some preparation -- and some awareness of the audience to boot. Astoundingly, many of the winners seemed to have not spent a minute thinking about what they might say. Perhaps they didn't want to jinx themselves. Understandable. But as Noah pointed out in his monologue, the winner in every category is always going to be either you or one of, like, four other people. These are not lottery-winner odds.
Right. The odds are pretty good. Always better to be prepared in life.
So what has happened to the fine art of the award-acceptance speech?
For one thing, the two crucial ingredients in such speechifying -- humility and gratitude -- run smack into our current obsession with telling our own stories, otherwise known as self-promotion.
Humility is now widely seen as a missed opportunity for personal branding. Gratitude is read as unnecessary abdication of self. With its privileging of the personal, social media has made first-person bragging not just acceptable but a professional necessity. It has become our new arms race: everyone else is doing it so you feel like you have no choice but to compete. Some are more sophisticated than others in cloaking their real intent, but we're all complicit.
So to do what, say, Sidney Poitier did in 2002 when he accepted an honorary Oscar and gave one of the greatest Academy Awards speeches of all time -- eloquently throwing all of the credit for his astounding career onto the backs of courageous, visionary others -- now feels like a relic from another era. Poitier knew what he wanted to do before he even approached the microphone. He understood that emotional engagement means pausing, breathing, caring about the listener, understanding from where the audience arrives. It means keeping your own emotions -- ecstatic as you may be -- in check. His humility was breathtaking in its power -- his listeners did not move a muscle. His speech had a beginning, a middle and an end. It was, you might say, crafted.
At the Grammys, there was no respite to be had in the commercial breaks. Advertisers have now figured out that they cannot sell their stuff to you anymore unless they glob their products on to your personal story. If you took away the superior production values, the advertisements on the Grammy's weren't so much different from the acceptance speeches. Mostly, we just heard, "me, me, me."
Me and my journey, broken up by why you need this perfectly tailored product to make your journey.
There is reason to worry that we're so obsessed with telling our own stories that we're losing our ability to communicate those belonging to anyone else. Take, for example, the controversy over the new book by the former New York Times editor, Jill Abramson, one of the most distinguished journalists of the current era. In her book, her very interesting book, "Merchants of Truth," Abramson uses secondary sources as a means of discussing some of the troubled waters swirling around the noble journalistic profession. That's a perfectly fine decision. What is not perfectly fine is that Abramson clearly used some material without crediting it as she goes in her storytelling. She merely footnotes it, in a blanket, hat-tip sort of way. But that's problematic because it comes off as her taking other peoples' stories as her own.
When questioned by Sean Illing of Vox in recent days, Abramson said she was "trying to write a seamless narrative, and to keep breaking it up with 'according to' qualifiers would have been extremely clunky."
This is not hard to understand. We're all under pressure to write or perform seamless personal narratives these days; we're surrounded by them and they are the narratives that everyone currently is buying and selling. And, yes, all of that "according to" stuff is indeed clunky; you didn't see much of it at the Grammy's either, especially not doing the commercial breaks. But journalism, culture, media, advertising, politics -- the world actually operates according to "according to" metrics.
No one wins an Oscar or a Grammy without other people. We rarely blaze our own trails or write our stories on our own. However unique we think our personal journey, our stories actually are far more like the stories of others than we like to admit. We always stand on a previous generation's shoulders -- and our narratives are all interdependent. There should be no shame in "according to" or "thanks to." Clunky is a small price to pay for truth.
Unless you're accepting an award. Then, as Poitier once taught us, you need to be both thankful and smooth.

The Joy of Standards

Texto completo: Our modern existence depends on things we can take for granted. Cars run on gas from any gas station, the plugs for electrical devices fit into any socket, and smartphones connect to anything equipped with Bluetooth. All of these conveniences depend on technical standards, the silent and often forgotten foundations of technological societies.
The objects that surround us were designed to comply with standards. Consider the humble 8-by-16-inch concrete block, the specifications of which are defined in the Masonry Society's "Building Code Requirements and Specification for Masonry Structures."
This book distills centuries of knowledge about the size and thickness of blocks, seismic design requirements and the use of materials like concrete, glass and mortar. Professionals worked through committees organized by the American Concrete Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers and the Masonry Society from 1977 to 1989 to foster consensus around this single national standard.
The number of technical standards that go into some products is astonishing, and the complexity of the methods used to create these standards is perhaps even more remarkable. A 2010 study found that a laptop computer incorporates 251 standards. Companies such as I.B.M. and Microsoft created some of these standards -- but only 20 percent of them. The other 80 percent of the laptop's standards were developed by private or nongovernmental organizations that facilitate collaboration and cooperation among technical experts.
These facts should prompt some reflection about the exercise of power in a technological society: Amid concerns about the excesses of market power and government regulation, nobody seems to worry much about the private groups of experts who created 80 percent of the laptop's standards. Standards created this way, known as the "voluntary consensus" process, are ubiquitous. They range from technologies like electrical plugs, lumber and concrete, to rules and certifications for food safety and environmental sustainability, to more personal matters such as definitions of health and disease.
The basic irony of standards is the simple fact that there is no standard way to create a standard, nor is there even a standard definition of "standard." There are, however, longstanding ways that industries and nations coordinate standardization efforts. In the United States, the system of voluntary consensus standards is coordinated by ANSI, the American National Standards Institute.
The standards-development organizations accredited by ANSI follow a bottom-up process. It begins when someone proposes a draft standard, which then goes through a period of public comment. A panel of stakeholders and interested parties then seeks to resolve points of friction. Eventually this process, which often takes years, results in a final published standard.
ANSI was first known as the American Engineering Standards Committee, which was created to address rampant incompatibility throughout American industry. (It was eventually reconstituted in 1966 and took on the name ANSI in 1969.) Its founders came from engineering organizations and departments of the federal government that all published their own standards, which were of limited value because they varied from group to group. The consequences could be catastrophic, as with the 1904 fire that destroyed much of downtown Baltimore: Buildings could have been saved if fire departments from neighboring cities had hoses that fit Baltimore's fire hydrants.
The Engineering Standards Committee's solution to technical incompatibility was to get organized. At its first meeting, in 1918, it created a process where people could work out the details of technical specifications and agree to carry them out. The structure of the standardization panels balanced producers and consumers -- that is, makers and users of technologies -- so that no single company could dictate the outcome. This method incorporated advice from British engineers, who had created a similar organization a decade earlier, and reflected lessons from World War I, where cooperation among engineers led to technological and humanitarian accomplishments. During the war, Herbert Hoover, who was then head of the United States Food Administration, coordinated farming and business interests, as well as the automobile, railroad and shipping industries, to provide food for America and its allies.
The consensus-driven approach had two clear advantages over existing alternatives. First, a forum to bring "all interested parties" into alignment reduced duplication and wasted effort. Second, the absence of state coercion to enforce standards meant that engineers and executives had strong incentives to resolve conflicts before they published a standard, lest they face government intervention down the road. The success of their efforts would depend on the voluntary adoption of standards. The consensus process was well suited for a society where technological and economic progress was within reach -- all it needed to do was to find ways to cooperate.
This was no easy task. The standards committee's longtime secretary, Paul Gough Agnew, looked back wearily at the "endless discussions" that set the stage for the first meeting in 1918. One of the group's founders, the electrical engineer Comfort Adams, observed, "Fear and jealousy, as well as ignorance, were the chief obstacles which had to be overcome."
Over the past century, standardization has expanded immensely. Today, private transnational organizations create and revise thousands of consensus standards every year.
Although the voluntary consensus method has been effective, it has never been perfect. For example, "consensus" is often a euphemism. Nasty disagreements can derail the process. Companies that agree on standards one day turn around and sue one another the next. In some industries, companies can make fortunes by defying established standards -- think of innovative products from Apple, or bold designs from the leaders of the fashion industry. Standardization also creates losers, and it can be very costly to invest in the losing side of "standards wars" like VHS versus Betamax, or Blu-ray versus HD DVD.
Access to standards also poses challenges. Since the consensus-building process is costly, organizations like ANSI often try to cover expenses by selling or licensing access to standards documents. For example, the book of standards for concrete blocks and masonry structures costs $150. This business model strikes many critics as unjust, since private standards can be built into regulations, yet sometimes only citizens who pay can look at them.
The American system of standardization is driven by industry, but we should not lose sight of the crucial role played by government agencies. The National Bureau of Standards, now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, contributed research and ideas to the standards committee's efforts from the beginning. And governments often mandate standards around air pollution and automotive and aviation safety because industry did not adopt them on a voluntary consensus basis. Federal air pollution standards that led to the widespread adoption of the catalytic converter and reduced some automotive emissions by 99 percent worked through force, not bottom-up consensus.
Standards have always struggled with an image problem. Critics worry that a standardized world is dull and mediocre, a nightmare of conformity and Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Yet the champions of standardization insist that standards create the foundations for a better world. Albert Whitney, who was the standards committee's chairman from 1922 to 1924, argued that many accomplishments of civilization involved "the fixation of advances." The committee's motto in the 1920s declared: "Standardization is dynamic, not static; it means not to stand still, but to move forward together."
In an age of breathless enthusiasm for the new and "disruptive," it's worth remembering the mundane agreements embodied in the things around us. It's very ordinariness and settledness of standards that enable us to survive, and to move ahead.
Andrew Russell, the dean of arts and sciences at the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, and Lee Vinsel, an assistant professor of science and technology studies at Virginia Tech, are working on a book about innovation and maintenance.

OFF THE TRACKS WHY THE U.S. WILL NEVER HAVE HIGH-SPEED RAIL

Texto completo: California likes to think of itself as the state where the future happens, and in 2008, its voters decided the future was high-speed rail. In November of that year, they approved a $9 billion bond issue to begin one of the most ambitious government infrastructure projects in U.S. history: a bullet train connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles, at a cost of $33 billion.
For years, the optimists have spun starry visions of millions of Californians traveling quickly, comfortably and environmentally consciously between the state's two major population centers. The pessimists, meanwhile, have grimly watched the projected costs mount. At last count, the estimates had traveled northward of $75 billion, and for all anyone could tell, were still climbing.
On Tuesday, during his first State of the State speech, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called for the state to scale back the project to a less costly leg that would run through the Central Valley - much simpler to build in large part because there are relatively few people there who might want to raise objections to the project, or, say, ride a high-speed train. California voters can stop clutching their wallets. But voters elsewhere should pay close attention, because what happened in California illustrates the perils that face any U.S. rail project, or for that matter, any project at all that tries to meaningfully reshape U.S. infrastructure.
Almost anyone who travels abroad comes back wondering why every other country in the world seems to have cheap, speedy rail travel while Americans can barely go out for a cup of coffee without enduring either the tedium of an endless road-trip or the indignities of the TSA. Sadly, there is no one reason; rather, there are many reasons, all of them hard-to-impossible to fix, all of them conspiring to deprive us of the (gee-whiz!) trains that many of us would like to ride.
Distance. In other places of the world, such as China, Europe and Japan, major population centers are much closer to each other. And big cities that are reasonably close together is pretty much a prerequisite for high-speed rail, which is why they have it and we don't. Imagine what it would take to build a line from New York City to Los Angeles - or to Chicago, Houston or Phoenix.
Wealth. Of course, the United States does have a few clusters that look ripe for rail, notably Texas, and the Eastern Seaboard. And instead of high-speed rail between these cities, we have the Acela, which takes eight hours to travel from Washington to Boston and shakes like a maraca player with a meth habit. Why haven't we built something better? Because truly high-speed rail needs to travel in a fairly straight line; you don't want to be taking a sharp curve at 300 miles per hour. Our current rail infrastructure isn't that straight where it needs to be. Building newer, better, straighter rail lines would require the government to buy all the land between Point A and Point B and tear down anything that happened to be in the way. Because we're already really, really rich, what's between Point A and Point B is no longer farmland; instead we have a great deal of highly valuable real estate that will be very expensive to purchase - which we'd have to, because unlike China, our constitution gives the government limited ability to displace inconveniently located people.
Legal Proceduralism. Of course, Europe also has some pretty nice, and pretty pricey, stuff sitting between its cities. What Europe does not have, generally speaking, is the ability to tie up the government for a few decades in eminent domain appeals, environmental reviews and so forth. For historical reasons, the U.S. legal system offers citizens an unparalleled number of veto points at which they can attempt to block government projects. Any infrastructure project bigger than painting a schoolhouse thus has to either fight out the reviews and court cases for years, or buy off the opponents, or more likely, both.
Cost. U.S. infrastructure projects cost way more to build than they do everywhere else. The right likes to blame unions; the left likes to blame pricey consultants. But they're all arguing about the symptom rather than the disease. The reason U.S. transportation infrastructure costs so much is all the stuff I listed above, plus a healthy dose of federalism.
Read any essay bemoaning the cost of American infrastructure - say Brian Rosenthal's 2017 behemoth for The New York Times - and don't just gawk at the inflated numbers; ask yourself why U.S. infrastructure projects use so many consultants, so many union featherbedders and so on.
Answer: They are there to fend off future lawsuits, or to smooth compliance with some other level of government's regulatory bodies, or to appease some powerful lobby. And because these infrastructure projects involve so many different governments, none of whom has final authority over the project, there are a lot of lobbies that must be appeased.
Other countries have crony capitalism, of course, but the downside of our highly decentralized government, which pushes a lot of power down to smaller, more locally responsive governments, is that almost anyone can get a few cronies together and grab some politician's ear.
California displays all these pathologies with a vengeance. The part of the rail line that was reasonably cheap to build didn't go anywhere near where the people were; it ran through the Central Valley where land was reasonably cheap and the lobbies were relatively few. The parts of the line that were actually useful - the endpoints - promised endless legal and political headaches and astronomical costs. And those two endpoints were 400 miles apart - too far, in the end, to be reached.

Texto completo: When Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem at an N.F.L. preseason game in 2016, it began a controversy that would involve dozens of players and owners, athletes in other sports and politicians, including the president of the United States.
His gesture has led to two and a half years of protests, formal grievances and vigorous denunciations. With a settlement announced Friday in Kaepernick's grievance case against the N.F.L., one chapter in the saga has come to an end.
A timeline:
Aug. 26, 2016
Kaepernick, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, remains seated during the national anthem for a home preseason game.
"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," he tells NFL Media.
Kaepernick had been outspoken about issues like protests by white supremacists and police shootings of unarmed black men.
"If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right," he says.
The league initially responds by saying, "Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem."
Kaepernick's act draws praise and criticism. Drew Brees, the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, tells ESPN: "He can speak out about a very important issue. But there's plenty of other ways that you can do that in a peaceful manner that doesn't involve being disrespectful to the American flag."
Sept. 1, 2016
Kaepernick kneels for the anthem in a preseason game in San Diego, instead of sitting, and is joined by a teammate, Eric Reid. He also announces he will donate $1 million to charitable organizations.
"Once again, I'm not anti-American," Kaepernick says. "I love America. I love people. That's why I'm doing this. I want to help make America better."
Kaepernick is booed throughout the game by the home Chargers fans.
Sept. 5, 2016
President Barack Obama defends Kaepernick, saying, "I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about."
Two days later, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., is more equivocal. Referring to Kaepernick, he tells The Associated Press, "I don't necessarily agree with what he's doing."
"I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don't live in a perfect society," he adds. "On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the N.F.L. I personally believe very strongly in that."
Sept. 11, 2016
In Week 1 of the regular season, several more players kneel or raise a fist during the anthem. Four days later, Megan Rapinoe of the United States women's national soccer team also kneels during the anthem. The entire Indiana Fever team of the W.N.B.A. kneels as well, as do other athletes around the country, including, over the next month, some high school players.
Jan. 1, 2017
Kaepernick protests throughout the N.F.L. season. He winds up starting 11 games, and the 49ers finish 2-14. Though the team is bad, Kaepernick's adjusted yards per pass figure is a respectable 7.2. He has not played since.
March 2017
Kaepernick opts out of his contract, hoping for a better situation. But no offers come, though very average quarterbacks like Mark Sanchez, Mike Glennon, Josh McCown and E.J. Manuel find jobs.
Many suggest Kaepernick is being blackballed.
Aug. 9, 2017
The preseason begins with Kaepernick still unsigned. Anthem protests continue, in part prompted by deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. "The national anthem is a special moment to me," Goodell says. "It's a point of pride. That is a really important moment. But we also have to understand the other side that people do have rights and we want to respect those."
Sept. 24, 2017
Anthem protests reach their peak after President Trump says those players who do not stand for the anthem should be fired. Many players skip the national anthem altogether. Dozens of others kneel or lock arms on the sideline, joined, in some cases, by team owners.
Protests continue through the season, and Trump continues to fault the league for not disciplining players.
Oct. 15, 2017
Kaepernick, still unsigned, files a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league.
April 25, 2018
N.F.L. owners, players and league executives meet to discuss the protests. An audio recording obtained by The New York Times reveals that players are aggrieved that Kaepernick has not found a job. Owners are intent on finding a way to avoid Trump's continued criticism and say that large numbers of fans and sponsors have become angry about the protests.
May 2, 2018
Reid, one of the players at the N.F.L. meeting, files a grievance against the N.F.L., saying the league has blackballed him. He is joined by the players' union. (Reid is signed by Carolina in late September and plays in 13 games.)
May 23, 2018
N.F.L. owners rule that players can no longer kneel during the national anthem without leaving themselves open to punishment. But the league also says athletes can stay in the locker room while it is being performed.
Trump says that he is pleased with the N.F.L.'s new policy, but that he does not think the players should be staying in the locker room in protest. If a player is not standing for the national anthem, Trump says, "maybe you shouldn't be in the country."
In July, the union files a grievance over the policy.
Aug. 9, 2018
A handful of players protests as the preseason begins, drawing more condemnation from Trump.
Aug. 30, 2018
Kaepernick achieves an important win in his grievance against the N.F.L. An arbitrator, Stephen B. Burbank, says lawyers for Kaepernick had unearthed enough information for the case to proceed to a full hearing.
Sept. 3, 2018
Kaepernick becomes the face and voice of Nike's latest "Just Do It" campaign. Like so much else involving him over the previous two years, it draws praise and condemnation.
Feb. 3, 2019
During the Super Bowl, Kaepernick posts on his social media accounts images of athletes and celebrities wearing #imwithkap jerseys supporting his cause.
Feb. 15, 2019
The N.F.L. reaches settlements with Kaepernick and Reid in their grievance cases. Terms of the settlements are not disclosed, and the players and the league reach a confidentiality agreement.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

Texto completo: Retired New York University President John Sexton likes to tell the story about one of the ineffable moments of his life — Oct. 4, 1955.
Addressing several hundred students at Franklin & Marshall College during Thursday’s Common Hour, he used the Greek word hierophantic — a manifestation of the sacred — to describe the scene.
The secular event that took place that day has sacred meaning to Sexton and likely to thousands, if not millions, more.
For it was on that day that Sexton’s beloved Brooklyn Dodgers won their first — and only — World Series, defeating the New York Yankees 2-0 in Game 7, thus putting to rest decades of frustration.
At 3 p.m. that day, Sexton and his friend Dougie dashed out of their Catholic school and into his basement bedroom where they wrapped their fingers around a crucifix and listened on the radio as Yankee catcher Elston Howard made the final out.
“We’re holding, in dynamic tension, this crucifix between the two of us, and suddenly Dougie goes ‘Hurray,’ lets go of the crucifix and the head of Christ chips off the tip of my tooth,” Sexton said.
“Now that,” he exclaimed to laughter and applause, “is a hierophantic moment!”
Sexton is the author of The New York Times best-seller “Baseball as a Road to God: Seeing Beyond the Game.”
Spirituality's essence
The book arose from a popular class he taught at NYU. The class and book are about the elements of people’s lives that not only are hierophantic but ineffable — beyond what words can express.
Sexton spoke about finding the essence of spirituality in mundane things.
In doing so, he applies the kind of research usually reserved for religious studies to the game of baseball.
“This is going to be an hour spent in the transcendental dimension of human existence,” he said.
He described a trip he and his family took to Uluru in the Australian Outback where a massive orange sandstone rock rises from the ground.
“We’re seeing something beautiful. We’re seeing a natural wonder.”
But the native guide, he said, saw something sacred — the connection between heaven and Earth.
“There are these evocative moments where a hieropathy — the sacred — shines through. That’s touching the experience.”
Sexton uses baseball as his analogy. He uses the game as a path to God, not the path to God.
The clue, he said, is to watch what happens between pitches and the ballet of players as they move in concert once the ball is struck.
One review notes that the book finds common ground between baseball and what people understand about religion — sacred places and time, faith and doubt, blessings and curses.
But others, he said, may find something else — Uluru, for example — that manifests itself as sacred to one’s personal life.
“Once you get into what is called the ‘phenomenology’ of religion, you realize that anything is capable,” he said. “That’s why the book doesn’t make a triumphal display for baseball.
“What baseball can teach you that then moves very easily over to a contemplative, spiritual mystical life, is observing happily and living slow.”
About the speaker
Sexton holds a doctorate in history of American religion and is a lawyer by training. He clerked for the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger and was chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2003-2006, and chair of the Federal Reserve Systems Council of Chairs in addition to serving as dean of NYU’s law school before becoming the school’s president. He is president emeritus of New York University, dean emeritus of NYU School of Law, and Benjamin F. Butler Professor of Law. His latest book, “Standing for Reason: the University in a Dogmatic Age,” is scheduled for release in early 2019.

The play “is set in a small inn in California, spanning the years from 1950-1975. It is the story of two people who first come together over dinner at the inn, and then begin a 25-year affair that consists of them meeting once a year on the same weekend at the same inn. The scenes consist of the changes in their lives over the five years between meetings, years 1951, 1956, 1961, 1965, 1970 and 1975. The only characters in the play are George and Doris, played by Al Miscannon and Barb Poncelet,” Gillespie said in an email.
The play first premiered on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on March 13, 1975, according to the licensing company’s website, www.samuelfrench.com.
In the March 14, 1975, edition of The New York Times, Clive Barnes extolled the play as having “wit, compassion, a sense of humor and a feel for nostalgia - who could ask for anything more? It restores one’s faith in the possibility of a commercially styled Broadway hit - for here is a play clearly geared for popularity that does not for one moment talk down to its audience. Here is an old-fashioned, well-made play that is well made in a new way and for new times. It is an evening of unadulterated fun—all right then, adulterated fun.”
The play went on to win the 1975 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New American Play and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Play.
Other upcoming events at the Majestic, according to Gillespie, will be “Little Mermaid, Jr.” from Feb. 22-34; monthly free movies sponsored by M&T Bank; and “Curious Incident of The Dog in the Night-time” to be held March 8-10.

Texto completo: Amazon on Thursday said it was canceling its plans to build a corporate campus in New York City.
Although Amazon said it would not reopen its search for a second home, the company did say it plans to expand its tech hubs and corporate locations across the United States — meaning that some cities could still benefit from the tech giant's backing out of New York City. Those plans, however, may exclude Newark, which does not have an Amazon tech hub, even though Audible, an Amazon company, has its headquarters there.
"After much thought and deliberation, we've decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens," the company said in a statement. "For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term."
The company said it would not reopen the HQ2 search at this time but will proceed with its plans in Northern Virginia and Nashville. The company announced in November that it would split its proposed HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia. The company had previously announced it would open a new Operations Center of Excellence in downtown Nashville.
Amazon said it would also continue to hire and grow across its 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the United States and Canada
The company's tech hubs in North America outside Seattle employ more than 17,500 corporate employees, as opposed to warehouse and fulfillment staff. As of August, that number was anticipated to rise to 26,200 by 2023. With the change of plans for its HQ2, the growth of these tech hubs could mean more jobs in cities where Amazon already is.
In Newark, the company has a significant presence with its Audible headquarters. However, it is not one of the 17 cities with an Amazon tech hub.
Regardless of Amazon's decision not to reopen its HQ2 search, state and city officials said they are staying in contact with the tech giant, to be prepared should company officials change their minds. Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday that he contacted Amazon and Newark officials directly after he learned that the company had pulled out of New York City.
"After learning of the decision to pull out of their chosen HQ2 location, I contacted Amazon and city of Newark stakeholders directly, continuing a constant dialogue that predates my time as governor," Murphy said in a statement. "New Jersey is open for business, and now more than ever, Newark is the clear choice as the next presence for Amazon corporate offices. Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark's story of a city on the rise."
Mayor Ras Baraka on Thursday also said he welcomed the opportunity to resume conversations with Amazon should it want to relocate a portion of its proposed HQ2 campus to Newark.
"Given the city and state's assets — a strong talent pipeline, a diverse tech base, unmatched infrastructure and a highly accessible location — we are well poised to accommodate Amazon should they want to relocate New York City's portion of HQ2, in whole or part," Baraka said. "Legislation regarding the tax incentives has already been passed, our real estate options are still viable, and the community has been — and will continue to be — engaged."
After a flurry of contradicting reports published late last week, officials from near and far have come forward to remind the tech giant that if New York City doesn't want Amazon, there are plenty of places that do. It seems their outreach did not fall on deaf ears.
In New Jersey, where Newark was named a finalist in the year-long bidding process for Amazon's second headquarters, elected officials and city leaders reportedly have kept in touch with the company in hopes of keeping the campus near, if not in, New Jersey.
Earlier this week, Murphy made the most public case for New Jersey at a press conference for an unrelated event in Avenel in Middlesex County, where Amazon has fulfillment centers.
"Nothing's changed on the Newark story. I think it's one of the most inspiring, compelling urban stories in America, and it continues to be, and with each day the story gets stronger and better," Murphy said Monday. "So we remind everybody — Amazon, right through the entire alphabet — Newark and New Jersey are open for business. Period. Full stop."
State officials continue to work closely with Amazon because of the thousands of people the company already employs in New Jersey, Murphy added.
City leaders in Newark, too, have reportedly kept in close contact with Amazon. Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Alliance, which led negotiations with Amazon during the city's bidding process, told Fortune that she renewed talks with the tech giant six weeks ago.
"Our goal is to make sure we keep it in the region," Glover told the magazine. "We have reached out to express that our incentives on the state and city side have been passed, so there's more opportunity for them to be welcomed with ease."
Last year, former Gov. Chris Christie endorsed Newark's initial application and pledged as much as $7 billion in tax incentives, including $5 billion in state tax relief over a decade and $1 billion each in breaks on property taxes and income taxes from Newark. It would have been the largest tax incentive ever offered by New Jersey.
Glover did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
In November, Amazon announced that it would split its proposed HQ2, or its second headquarters in the United States, between New York City and Northern Virginia. The campus was expected to bring as many as 25,000 jobs to each campus.
Although Newark ultimately did not win the bid, it was chosen as one of 20 finalist cities out of hundreds. That was considered a win for New Jersey's most populous city.
Since Amazon announced that it would be heading to Long Island City in Queens, there has been push-back from politicians, residents and businesses.
On Friday, those tensions rose to an all-time high after The Washington Post published an article citing two people familiar with the company's thinking who said the company was having second thoughts about New York City.
Until Thursday, Amazon had not commented about those claims beyond a statement it gave to The Washington Post last week. In an email on Tuesday, a company spokesperson forwarded what appeared to be the same statement given to the Post, and declined to give further comment.
"We're focused on engaging with our new neighbors — small-business owners, educators, and community leaders," the spokesperson wrote. "Whether it's building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be."
Since the Post's story on Friday, conflicting reports have surfaced that implied Amazon would still move forward with its plans in New York City.
The same day of the bombshell report, The New York Times, also citing two people familiar with the company's thinking, reported that Amazon had no plans to back out. Sources told the Times that the story by the Post had gone too far.
The news that Amazon would be backing out of New York City came as a shock. As recently as Tuesday, officials were convinced that Amazon was still set on its HQ2 proposal in Queens.
On Tuesday, Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, told Bloomberg that Amazon's plans in New York City were still a go.
"Everybody that is involved on the ground here is all steam ahead," Lusskin told Bloomberg. "I have no direct indication that there's any change in that decision."
Although it remains unclear what exactly the tech giant will do in coming weeks, now that plans for New York City have fallen through, there are plenty of states ready to be Amazon's rebound.
Over the past several days, New Jersey and leaders in at least four other states have reportedly expressed their renewed interest in Amazon's HQ2, including Texas, Illinois, Connecticut and Florida. Even leaders in upstate New York have pitched themselves as an alternative to their own New York City.

Texto completo: Rocker Ryan Adams' immediate response to The New York Times reporting on his allegedly abusive relationships with multiple women was to say he was "taking you down" with a lawsuit - which he quickly deleted and replaced with a more temperate series of tweets.
"I know you got lawyers," he wrote before the piece was published. "But do you have the truth on your side. No. I do. Run your smear piece. But the legal eagles see you. Rats." That tweet quickly was taken down, as the gravity of his position seemed to kick in.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes," he wrote in the first of three new tweets after the Times' story appeared. "To anyone I have ever hurt, I apologize deeply. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he wrote in the final tweet for the time being.
Adams was responding to a detailed New York Times piece that alleged that Adams' manipulative relationships with women were laid out by seven women and more than a dozen associates in their reporting.

Paul to reprise 'Bad' role: Jesse Pinkman lives to fight another day. Aaron Paul will be back as the rough-around-the-edges second-in-command in the long-rumored "Breaking Bad" sequel, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Details on the project are still scarce, but the movie, written by series creator Vince Gilligan, will reportedly appear first on Netflix, then on AMC.
Glover gets 5 NAACP Image Awards noms: Donald Glover and his alter-ego Childish Gambino were nominated Wednesday for five NAACP Image Awards. Glover is nominated for his acting and directing on "Atlanta." On the music side, Childish Gambino is nominated for top male performer, and his song "This Is America" is nominated for best video and song. Glover won four Grammys on Sunday including record and song of the year. The 50th NAACP Image Awards will be held March 30 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
'Scrubs' creator promises return: Almost a decade after "Scrubs" left the airwaves, creator Bill Lawrence still expects to go back to Sacred Heart Hospital. The beloved show, which starred Zach Braff and Donald Faison, ran for nine seasons. "When we hit a time when we're all looking for work or we don't get to hang out as much, we will," Lawrence told the New York Daily News. "We'll definitely get there."

Play helped Virginia Stage Company grow; 'Secret Garden' at Norfolk Botanical Garden this weekend

Texto completo: If you walked along 44th Street in New York City's Broadway theater district in 1991, you might have noticed that the St. James Theatre was decorated with massive potted plants. On the billboard announcing a musical, "The Secret Garden," were the words: "Originally produced at the Virginia Stage Company."
It marked the first, and only, time that a play that had its world premiere at VSC wound up on Broadway, and it couldn't have come at a better time for the struggling theater company in Norfolk.
History is repeating itself this year, except for the part about VSC teetering on the brink of disaster. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Norfolk run, and as Broadway is set to welcome a revival of the musical, the VSC is presenting a special version of "The Secret Garden" at Norfolk Botanical Garden this weekend.
The drama within "Secret Garden" barely surpasses what the VSC was experiencing in 1988.
The musical is based on the beloved 1911 children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It concerns a bratty orphan named Mary Lennox, who is sent to live at her uncle's foreboding mansion on the edge of the British moors. She learns of a secret garden, and in her quest to find it she softens and helps other stunted residents of the estate to grow.
Lucy Simon, the sister of pop singer Carly Simon, had been interested in composing a musical version of the story for years. She saw an opportunity to stretch the boundaries of musical storytelling - especially to reach children. She worked with scriptwriter Marsha Norman, whose drama about a woman's suicide - "'Night, Mother" - won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for drama.
After evaluating companies all over the country, the authors asked VSC director Charles Towers to produce their musical. Towers' tenure at VSC was marked by original and arty works that were admired by critics but had left the company in financial chaos in 1988. The prospect of a hit that could be exported to Broadway, and perhaps bring royalties that would be received for every performance, was attractive.
Towers replaced "A Little Night Music" with the world premiere of the new musical.
Lucy Simon and a team of New York "names" lived in Norfolk for almost a month during rehearsals. Simon talked about her ambition to be on Broadway, and how she and Carly used to harmonize to the scores of "Oklahoma" and "Carousel."
After the premiere in November, 1989, at the Wells Theatre, I wrote an unfavorable review for The Virginian-Pilot, saying the show was not yet ready for Broadway, was unfocused and needed better visual aspects from the choreography and sets.
Carly Simon, who came to town for the premiere, later told me: "You were right. Don't be intimidated by those who try to shut you up. I'll talk to Lucy."
I told her that I had never wanted to write a rave review more than that night. Things got worse when Time magazine quoted the review. No one expected that.
Regardless, some $6 million in investments were raised and the show opened on Broadway in April 1991. The board of directors of Virginia Stage Company flew north to see the show that had originated in their theater. Stars such as Bernadette Peters, Linda Lavin and Maureen McGovern mixed on the red carpet with the local folks.
After the show, a flotilla of eight buses took the audience from Broadway to a riverfront market for the opening-night party. Carly Simon approached me at the party and said, "Well, they did exactly what you wanted them to do, so you should be happy. It's all over now but counting the take. Come on, I want you to meet Lucy."
During the month of rehearsals in Norfolk, I had avoided meeting the director.
The mood was festive, but rumors circulated that the New York Times review, by Frank Rich, was negative. That could be fatal.
The rumors proved to be true. When the Times hit the street at 3 a.m., it claimed that the show had no pulse and was too obsessed with paying homage to the book rather than finding its own voice. Rich particularly knocked the show's star, Mandy Patinkin, who played the uncle.
Clive Barnes, for the New York Post, wrote that "it has little musical substance" and added, just to make it worse, that "it is Contrary Mary and a host of ghosts."
This might have killed most musicals, but "Secret Garden" had a built-in potential audience: a horde of book-readers who loved the source. Time magazine helped, too, writing that it was "the best Broadway musical of the season." Those who liked it liked it a lot. Indeed, the box office for the musical was quite healthy, with lots of mother-daughter groupings.
It quickly shaped up as the major challenger to "Miss Saigon" for the year's Tony Awards.
The show won three Tonys, for its set (Heidi Landesman), book (Marsha Norman) and best featured player in a musical. That went to Daisy Eagan, 11, the youngest performer at the time to win the award.
On the same day that "Secret Garden" was nominated for the Tony Awards, the 40-member board of Virginia Stage Company met in Norfolk to vote on whether or not to close down the Wells Theatre. The company's campaign to sell 8,500 subscriptions had fallen far short. Just $69,280 had been raised by the time board President Don Chapman called for a vote on whether a 1991-92 season could even be mounted. The vote was to stay open. And the VSC lives today.
But hopes of big bucks for VSC from "Secret Garden" did not pan out. The company that originally produces the show gets a cut. It had been thought that this could amount to some $3,000 a week. But some 80 percent of the investors had decided to take a cut in the royalties in an effort to keep the show running.
Competing against "Miss Saigon" didn't help the garden grow, either.
No one today at VSC can ascertain how much "The Secret Garden" brought in as a result of royalties. Even so, VSC still gets a little something, and the revival on Broadway certainly won't hurt.
We're still waiting for Broadway lightning to strike again, but, meanwhile, there's this weekend's special presentation.
"The Secret Garden" will be staged at the botanical garden, but it's not an outdoor affair. The performances are being held in the newly renovated administration building, which overlooks a garden. The weather is not likely to add any drama to the history of this musical.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria provoked widespread fears over a future resurgence of the Islamic State. But it may yet have a silver lining: Other countries have signaled they are willing to take back their citizens who joined the terrorist group but are now detained in makeshift camps.
About 850 men and several thousand women and children from nearly 50 countries are being held in northern Syria in detention camps for Islamic State fighters and sympathizers. They have been locked up indefinitely, in ad hoc wartime prisons and refugee camps, by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which is allied with the United States.
[A British woman who joined the Islamic State in Syria wants to come home.]
Most of those detainees' home countries have been looking the other way, despite the Kurds' pleas to relieve them of that burden. But Mr. Trump's sudden announcement on Dec. 19 that he intended to withdraw American troops soon has since called into doubt the Kurds' ability to maintain control of the prisons and camps.
That, in turn, has led to concerns that the foreign fighters could escape or be freed and return home to launch attacks -- and to a new burst of activity to repatriate some of them.
"Since the Syria withdrawal announcement was made in December, we have detected a new sense of urgency among our partner nations," said Nathan A. Sales, the State Department's top counterterrorism official.
There is no indication that Mr. Trump was thinking about how to manage the detainees when he announced the Syria withdrawal. But forcing allies to consider repatriating their detained citizens may be the latest of a handful of examples in which the president's disruptive approach has managed to shake loose results.
Since taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly undermined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in appearing to link commitments of American military support to member states that lived up to obligations on domestic military spending. His suggestion infuriated allies. But several countries have since increased their military spending, accelerating a previously tepid upward trend.
And in the summer of 2017, Mr. Trump's bellicose talk of raining "fire and fury" upon North Korea may have prompted the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, to pause his nuclear and missile tests and begin negotiations to eliminate his nuclear arsenal. The long-term results of those negotiations, however, remain unclear.
Daniel Fried, a former senior State Department official who retired in 2017 and is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that Mr. Trump's disruptive approach sometimes appeared meant to produce favorable results. At other times, he said, it seemed pointless -- as when allies were denigrated.
But in solving the problem of Islamic State detainees, Mr. Fried said, the president's abrupt order to leave Syria may prove helpful.
"Unintentionally, it may be that Trump's disruptive style has had a positive impact in forcing countries to face problems that they would rather kick down the road," Mr. Fried said.
The prospect of repatriating citizens who had joined the Islamic State, and of trying to prosecute or reintegrate them into society, has raised daunting concerns for many allied governments over security, legal and political risks. Not one detainee from the makeshift Syrian camps was returned to their home nation in the last five months of 2018.
But in January, Kazakhstan announced that it had repatriated about 46 of the detainees, including about 41 women and children. Four American officials said Oman and Tunisia also took back some of their citizens from the Kurds.
A Tunisian official denied that his government had agreed to repatriate any Islamic State fighters or their families. But several other officials said up to nine people among what was described as a large number of Tunisian detainees have so far been returned.
At a news conference last week in Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, a senior Saudi official, said his government was willing to repatriate some 50 Saudi men held in the Kurdish camps.
Several European countries that had previously refused to deal with their detained citizens are now considering repatriating some of them, including Kosovo.
"We are encouraged that partner nations see the value in taking responsibility for the appropriate disposition of their citizens who chose to travel to Syria and fight ISIS," said Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, who declined to address specific countries.
Additionally, reports last month indicated that France is close to deciding whether to bring back about 130 of its detained citizens, including men, women and children. Other European countries with large numbers of detained citizens, including Germany and Belgium, are said to be closely watching how Paris will decide, with an eye toward echoing it.
In a statement to The New York Times, France's Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs made clear that the withdrawal of American forces from Syria had forced it to deal with the detainees.
"In light of developments in the military situation in northeastern Syria and American decisions, and in order to ensure the security of French people, we are exploring all options in order to prevent these potentially dangerous individuals from escaping or dispersing," the statement said.
Christopher P. Costa, a former National Security Council senior director for counterterrorism in the Trump administration, said the new willingness by nations is a positive sign for a dilemma that has few good answers.
"States don't always think that this president is predictable in many ways, so if we can enjoy countries taking on ownership of detainees, that is a good outcome of accelerating withdrawal of U.S. forces," said Mr. Costa, now the head of the International Spy Museum in Washington.
Countries have different reasons for their reluctance to take back Islamic State detainees.
Most are rooted in security concerns about people who may be difficult to successfully prosecute and imprison with lengthy sentences. Even those who pose little or no security risks may be hard to reintegrate into society because of their ideology or wartime experiences, and children who had been part of ISIS through no fault of their own are likely to be stigmatized.
For democracies, there is scant political support for bringing back such a problematic group, although the Belgian government was recently ordered by a court to repatriate two women and six children.
In Britain this week, a debate erupted over whether the government should rescue Shaminma Begum, 19, a British woman who ran away to join ISIS three years ago and is now nine months pregnant and in a refugee camp. She told a Times of London reporter that said she wanted to go home but expressed no regrets about traveling to Syria.
Countries with fragile governments, like Tunisia, also worry about the ability to absorb a large cohort of returning extremists. Additionally, the prospect of repatriating detainees to states with poor human rights records, such as Egypt or China, has raised humanitarian concerns.
The large number of detainees from Yemen poses a different problem, given that the civil war in that country could render assurances for their prosecution or resettlement at least difficult, if not impossible.
One American official described preliminary efforts to cajole third countries to resettle some detainees who cannot be returned to their troubled home nations, following a precedent during the Obama administration of resettling many lower-level Guantánamo detainees in foreign states.
For now, that remains a long-term goal. But another official, Mr. Sales, described early signs of progress in persuading some countries to reclaim their own citizens for prosecution -- or at least to keep them from returning to the battlefield.
"That message is resonating now in a way it hasn't in the past, and I think that is because our partner nations recognize there is a narrowing window of opportunity here," he said. "As long as the U.S. remains active in northeast Syria, we are better able to influence outcomes. That is why I think you are seeing our partners focus on this with a greater sense of seriousness."

Valentine's Day is also for those sailing solo

Texto completo: It begins with a glance...
Oliver Stilson made his way up the aisle, his phone number on a piece of paper tucked inside a small gift for Margaret McCoy. He then asked the much younger woman to have dinner with him. A few dates later and the two knew it was love.
"She's a good Christian lady," Stilson said, according to WKRC in Knoxville, Tennessee, "...and we just didn't want to part when it came time to go home."
They married last September — he's 95, she's 81.
Gym rats Gertrude Mokotoff and Alvin Mann were introduced while working out. The New York Times says, "In a heartbeat, they became an item." She's older and some called her a cougar, but Alvin says, "Age doesn't mean a d--n thing..."
They married a year and a half ago, just before her 99th birthday and boy-toy Alvin's 94th.
Jim and Janice Catlin, 88 and 86, met on the school bus when they were kids according to Inside Edition. After being separated a while — uh, like 70 years — they married last summer. Their first glance was in 1947.
Three unusual courtships, but nothing compares to the love story of a young princess and warrior who marry and then are separated by her father for at least a decade, perhaps two. It's during a bloody civil war, after the king's death, that this warrior husband says there will be no peace until he has her back.
It sounds like a fairy tale or Hollywood script, but no. The story is true, occurring 1,000 years before Christ — straight from the pages of the Bible. Here's what happens.
There's a great celebration when David kills Goliath. The young shepherd turned soldier is so beloved by the Hebrews that King Saul fears losing his kingdom to David. Originally, Saul had promised his daughter to whomever killed the giant, but that doesn't happen. Instead, Saul asks David for 100 Philistine foreskins as a bride-price for Michal, hoping David will be killed by the enemy. David takes his men and returns with 200 foreskins! 1Samuel 18:25-27
Michal and David then marry, but Saul is determined to kill David and tries again. Michal helps her husband escape, letting him down through a window, and then places his likeness in a bed to trick Saul's soldiers.
It's a dangerous business because Michal's father is losing his mind. King Saul tries to kill his son for taking David's side and is furious with Michal over her deceit. She isn't harmed — not physically — but perhaps pays a steeper price when Saul marries her to another man. 1Samuel 19:8-17, 20:30-33, 25:44
After Saul dies, civil war rages across Israel. David refuses to even consider a truce until Michal is returned to him. Here's an interesting detail. Michal's second husband, Paltiel, weeps as he follows along behind Michal when she's taken away from him, probably by Saul's general, Abner. If Michal cares or even says good-bye, it's not in Scripture.
"Return," Abner orders Paltiel as they reach the border, sending him home.
Would David have killed Paltiel for taking his bride? No one wants to find out, not on the eve of a truce. 2Samuel 2:8-3:16
The love between David and Michal is one of the Bible's great romantic stories. In fact, when Scripture says Michal loved David at 1Samuel 18:20, it's the only place in the Hebrew Bible where a named woman loves a man. That's according to Bible scholar Victor Hamilton.
Today is Valentine's Day. Celebrate. Hold your love close and know that you're blessed!
If you're like I am and sailing solo, Valentine's Day is still for you. Seriously. Hear me out.
Smart churches join together for one big community singles' event, as do other groups. Everyone will be available, so gather your courage and go. "The person who finds a spouse...finds favor from the Lord." Proverbs 18:22
But choose wisely. Don't ask, "Do you attend church?" — trust me, they'll all say yes. Instead, ask about last week's sermon and see what happens. The person who values the Lord worships Him.
Never give up hope. Love can bloom at any time — just ask the Stilsons, Manns, and Catlins.
Remember, it begins with a glance...

Texto completo: For the Valley News
The only thing I dislike about New England is that, whenever I have an inspiration about a feature of our beautiful but sequestered life, I discover that another immigrant far more talented — Robert Frost — has already been there. Likewise commentary on the socio-political scene: Whenever I think I’ve devised a new approach to some of the problems that appear to be besetting our nation, I can only exclaim, along with Charlie Brown, “Rats!” A flock of historians and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have beaten me to it.
Nevertheless, I persist. I notice, for example, that in our never-ending — and media-stoked — fascination with the next election, no matter how far off, the positioning, sloganeering and sniping are almost without surcease. (Canada sometimes looks awfully good from here.) At times it all gets old. And yet, as I’ve suggested, we’re fascinated to read of the latest development.
I’ve been delighted to note the increase in diversity of the latest crop of new members of the House of Representatives. Elected, as many of them were, on a wave of rebellious passion by younger voters than usual, they are themselves pretty passionate in some cases. Speaker Nancy Pelosi functions at times like the chaperone on a high school class trip.
All very exciting. And for a lot of old, entrenched white guys, more than a little threatening. How can you tell? Check out the fake, doctored or gaslighted attacks in social media, and pick up the ominous references in the president’s speeches — as well as, now, those of his secretary of the treasury, Steven Mnuchin. The president states that “America will never become a socialist nation, I promise you!” and the secretary, “We’re not going back to socialism.” Racking my brains and experience, I can’t come up with a time that it ever was — not, at least, in their implied meaning of the word.
Here in the Home of the Brave, many of us react to the idea of socialism as if it were an evil monster lurking in our rooms at bedtime. To flog the metaphor further, we jump fearfully over it and dive under the covers without looking to see whether or what it may be. This is not the path of wisdom.
Older Americans have been habituated to react negatively to the term. It’s been to blame for most of the world’s evils, from the murder of Czar Nicholas II and his family to the National Recovery Act. My own stern, staunch Republican forebears resisted with every fiber what historian Daniel Rodgers has called “a great, explosive release of the pent-up agenda of the progressive past.”
In 1947, a Republican-controlled Congress — fearing that Harry Truman might try to emulate FDR’s political longevity — approved limiting presidents to two terms (the 22nd Amendment was approved by the states in 1951) and Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952. Eisenhower’s director of the CIA, Allen Dulles (whose sexual shenanigans make President Donald Trump’s look like high school crushes), and his brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, became incensed at Iran’s first elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh (“that madman Mossadegh!”) when the prime minister moved to nationalize the British oil companies that were bleeding his country’s resources. The CIA collaborated in a coup that replaced him with the Shah. We know how that ended, and yet wonder why Iran is a little tetchy toward us.
It hasn’t helped that the Soviet Union, who Sen. Joseph McCarthy assured us was about to devour us from within, was called a union of “socialist republics.”
It’s helped even less that Fidel Castro’s Cuba, a frankly Communist nation, has been lumped with socialism, yet seems to be limping along just fine in spite of the decades-old animus of the mighty gringo nation only 90 miles to the north. Nor are any thanks due to Hugo Chavez or his favored successor, Nicolás Maduro, both of whom have called their failing governments socialist, when they’re actually chaotic combinations of populism and kleptocracy.
Our president, never much for Marquess of Queensberry or Robert’s Rules, has, I’m certain, never read George Lakoff’s Don’t Think of an Elephant! But he’s already begun to frame the argument of the next 21 months as a battle between blood-red, independent American values (MAGA) and the monstrous socialist state envisioned and promoted by what he calls (dog-whistle!) the “Democrat” Party.
It’s no good to argue that all our infrastructure — roads, bridges, airports — and public services — police, fire department, snowplowing, even 9-1-1 — are the result of a “socialist” idea: that people, pooling their resources, can enjoy a better life than they could afford on their own.
Instead, embrace the frame! Recognize that young Americans don’t fear it as do their elders. Avoid pontification. Remember that would-be “strongmen” hate humor and satire (Saturday Night Live anyone?), and perhaps take a page from the famous 1952 speech, If by Whiskey, by Mississippi state Rep. Noah S. “Soggy” Sweat Jr.
Social democracy isn’t the monster under your bed. It’s the road at the foot of your driveway, and a damn good thing it is, too. It’s what we’ve already got. But given the current and escalating problems of our government, it needs a good shot in the arm.

Texto completo: Media bias may not be as bad as it seems. But that doesn't mean recent coverage of Democrats' "Green New Deal" has been fair or accurate.
Conservative news consumers have been chuckling over a headline this week in the New York Times: "Ocasio-Cortez Team Flubs a Green New Deal Summary, and Republicans Pounce." The long-running joke among right-leaning media skeptics is that when leftist politicians support destructive policies or make outrageous claims, reporters ignore them—except when they can be used to cast conservatives as opportunistic and self-interested critics of the bad ideas.
In the story that has inspired another round of "Republicans Pounce" gags on social media this week, Coral Davenport writes:
Days after introducing her Green New Deal — a plan to combat climate change that has won the endorsement of several Democratic presidential candidates — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found the proposal enmeshed in confusion when her staff published a summary that included provisions not endorsed by the candidates.
Over the weekend her staff backed away from the document, saying it was incomplete and had been published by accident, after Republicans pounced on the plan, citing a blog post of frequently asked questions. That post included language that called for economic security "for all who are unable or unwilling to work."
One doesn't need to be a Republican to criticize the idea of handouts for people who refuse to work. A reasonable taxpayer might regard such criticism as the bare minimum to be expected of any elected official. Clearly this is a story about a radical idea which deserved to be hooted down.
But what about the notion that media coverage consistently presents Republicans as "pouncing" instead of offering legitimate arguments against proposals like the Green New Deal? It's difficult to measure qualitatively but some raw numbers suggest that news reporters and editors have been giving this verb a bipartisan workout.
The Journal's parent Dow Jones operates the Factiva news service, which offers a voluminous database of sources including newspapers, magazines and television news transcripts, among others. The archive goes back decades. A search for "Republicans pounce" conducted via Factiva returned 245 entries. But no fewer than 311 stories popped up when this column entered the search term, "Democrats pounce."
For example , according to CNN, last August the legal travails of Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort had Democrats pouncing. The party seems to have a tradition of engaging in such behavior, at least according to the Associated Press, which reported Democrats pouncing on President George W. Bush's economic plan in 2003.
Serving as the prey when Democrats pounced seems to have been a family tradition. In 1992 the New York Times itself spotted Democrats pouncing on a disappointing jobs report when Mr. Bush's father was President.
Disappointing jobs reports are of course much harder to come by in the Trump era, but if one comes along perhaps an administration critic will launch himself on top of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Or at least that's how the criticism will be described.
Perhaps instead of editorializing about the motives of a speaker— using a verb that often makes readers think of animals trying to eat other animals—reporters might simply quote the speaker.
In this week's example it seems especially odd to focus on particular critics of an idea when the idea itself clearly represents a broad threat to the U.S. economy. One can argue that environmental considerations justify the proposed economic destruction, but no one can deny that the financial costs would be immense. Reuters notes that opposition to a complete overhaul of U.S. energy production and consumption is not confined to Republican lawmakers:
Labor unions say they are withholding support for a Green New Deal unveiled by Democrats last week to transition the American economy away from fossil fuels, arguing the loosely-defined plan could kill jobs if its architects aren't careful.
The accidental publishing of the plan to hand money to people who won't work seems to answer the question of how careful the plan's authors are. But back to the Reuters report on the Green New Deal:
It also calls for a "just transition" for current fossil fuel workers - from coal miners to pipeline workers - through guarantees of healthcare, jobs, and job training.
Union officials told Reuters they were skeptical.
"We will never settle for 'just transition' language as a solution to the job losses that will surely come from some of the policies in the resolution," said Yvette Pena O'Sullivan, executive director of the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), whose members work in construction and other industries.
Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers (UMWA), which represents workers in the coal industry, echoed the concerns.
"We've heard words like 'just transition' before, but what does that really mean? Our members are worried about putting food on the table," he said.
The Green New Deal sounds like a plan to pounce on millions of American jobs. Isn't that the story?

THE MYTHICAL EFFECTS OF VOTER ID A NEW STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE POLARIZED DEBATE OVER VOTER IDENTIFICATION ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT

Texto completo: Usually when some sententious centrist talks about ending partisan polarization and just coming up with "solutions" based on "data" or "studies" or "expert consensus," the appropriate response is to roll your eyes - the way people have been eye-rolling lately at Howard Schultz of Starbucks and his apparently substance-free vision for an independent presidential campaign. Usually where you find polarization, you also find some issue of great moment, some important conflict of interests or values that can't just be turned over to the smart people to solve because any "solution" would inevitably be a victory for one side and a defeat for the other.
But there are occasional exceptions: Polarizing issues where you could essentially call a truce without anyone winning or losing, without it affecting the balance of power in America's political debates and culture wars, without anything disappearing except a lot of nonsense, hysteria and panic.
My candidate for the exception is the debate over voter ID laws. For as long as I've been politically conscious, conservatives have touted tougher identification requirements at the polls as a means to fight the scourge of voter fraud, and over the last decade Republicans have successfully implemented voter ID laws in a number of reddish states. Over the same period those laws have been cited by liberals as evidence that Republicans are bent on winning elections by disenfranchising Democrats - locking out poor and minority voters in a rerun of the Jim Crow-poll tax era, and electing conservative politicians at the expense of democracy itself.
You could imagine a world in which the voter ID debate reflected a real and sweeping clash of interests. If conservatives were right that the laws reduced rampant voter fraud by preventing illegal immigrants from voting for Democrats in large numbers, and meanwhile liberals were also right that the laws dramatically reduced turnout among African-Americans and other liberal-leaning constituencies, effectively limiting the right to vote, then the whole debate would be extremely consequential and difficult to resolve.
In the real world, however, the stakes seem to be considerably lower. That's the conclusion of a new study, one of the largest to date, from the economists Enrico Cantoni and Vincent Pons, which assessed the impact of voter ID laws between 2008 and 2016 using a nationwide voter file. The study finds that requiring voter identification has no effect on turnout - not overall, and not on "any group defined by race, gender, age or party affiliation."
If that shocks you, it shouldn't. The evidence that voter ID laws meaningfully suppress minority votes has always been shaky; a literature review in 2017 that filtered out studies with obvious design flaws reported "modest, if any, turnout effects of voter identification laws" in the best research on the subject. So a voter ID requirement might possibly affect the closest of close races, based on what we've learned up till now - but if the Cantoni and Pons results hold up, the real effect is basically nil.
But before conservatives claim vindication, the new paper also casts doubt on the argument for voter ID laws, finding no effect on fraud itself, nor even any effect on public confidence in the integrity of the ballot. Which should be even less surprising than the absence of evidence for voter suppression, because since the George W. Bush administration, a large group of people with strong incentives to uncover voter fraud - Republican lawmakers, law-enforcement personnel and conservative election researchers - have failed to produce any evidence that the problem exists on a scale that requires a legislative response. And the rare prosecuted cases generally seem disproportionate to the offense involved - with confused individuals in the dock rather than old-fashioned Chicago-style machines.
There is more to the voting-rights debate than just voter ID laws; nothing in the new study settles arguments about early voting, absentee balloting and more. Still, because the ID debate is a particular flash point, its findings are a real public service. No matter where you stand on the voter fraud-voter suppression controversies, these findings strengthen the case for dialing down outrage, reducing anxiety and generally recognizing that if we stopped pushing for these laws and stopped freaking out about how they supposedly doom democracy, voting in America would rattle along basically unchanged.
But since it's conservatives and Republicans who are the prime movers here, because they're generally the ones pushing legal changes, they also have the primary obligation to step back and stand down.
Despite what many liberals believe, much of the right's anxiety about voter fraud is sincere, not just a cynical cover for racist vote suppression. I have had enough arguments with fellow conservatives on this issue to attest that the specter of those old Chicago operations haunts the right, along with more contemporary fears generated by a left that really does want to extend some of the benefits of citizenship to illegal immigrants.
At the same time there's also no question that a lot of Republican operatives pushing voter ID laws are cynics who expect their party to benefit from lower minority turnout, and a number of professional right-wing partisans - including our president - see an upside in frightening their voters or viewers with the racialized threat of "urban" ballot-stuffing.
Which, again, is what makes the evidence from this study so helpful: It offers reasons for both the conservative sincerely worried about voter fraud and the operative cynically hoping for lower Democratic turnout to let this issue slide.
And in letting it slide, Republicans might even have more to gain than Democrats. After all, the cynical side of the voter ID push is pretty transparent, meaning that even if the laws don't have real vote-suppressing consequences, they do serve as a continuing gesture of disrespect to minority voters, a continuing expression of GOP indifference to the African-American memory of what voting restrictions used to mean. So their removal from the Republican agenda could be an act of minority outreach unto itself.
Maybe that's too optimistic. But even without that upside, the case for standing down is strong. The voter ID debate essentially involves Republicans whipping themselves into a panic over a problem that doesn't meaningfully affect their chances of winning elections, and then passing laws that whip Democrats into a panic over a problem that also doesn't meaningfully affect their chances of winning elections. So if the debate simply disappeared tomorrow, a source of distrust would vanish without either side losing ground.
There are few cases where that's possible. Let's seize this one.

Texto completo: ALBANY - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday defended the controversial financial incentives to lure Amazon to Long Island City, saying it was "mission critical" to land the thousands of jobs at stake.
The progressive Democrat told lawmakers who are reviewing the state budget that he wished the bidding process for the Amazon campus was more transparent and there should be federal legislation to prevent companies from pitting city against city for jobs.
But in the end, the city had a "real life choice to make" and the 25,000 jobs promised by the retail giant was worth the $3 billion in city and state incentives, de Blasio said. The deal, brokered by de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, faces resistance in the State Senate and City Council.
Even though he often opposes "corporate welfare" and favors higher taxes on the wealthy, the mayor said New York had to offer something to beat out the dozens of other competitors.
"To me, it was mission critical that this city get those jobs rather than those other cities," de Blasio told lawmakers conducting a state budget hearing on local government funding. "We believe that a very careful track of the competition [indicated] there were several other cities poised to win and we had to strike the right balance."
The mayor's reaffirmation for the deal came just days after Cuomo and Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria) exchanged sharp words over Amazon. Cuomo, also a Democrat, cited a Washington Post report saying Amazon was reconsidering coming to New York in the face of local opposition and he accused the State Senate of "governmental malpractice." A subsequent report by The New York Times said Amazon isn't, in fact, considering backing away from New York.
Gianaris, who represents the area of Queens where Amazon would locate, accused Cuomo of making a "secret" and "bad" deal with the company, and raised the possibility the governor had orchestrated the threat of Amazon leaving as a way to silence critics. Gianaris believes the state and city shouldn't have offered the $3 billion in incentives, which he says should be spent on schools and the crumbling subways.
The senator was recently nominated to an arcane but important panel that signs off on tax and other state incentives for economic development. Cuomo hasn't said whether he'll block the nomination.
Amazon had announced in November it had decided to build half its East Coast headquarters in Long Island City and half in Northern Virginia, promising 25,000 jobs for each location.
"The notion of that many jobs and that much tax revenue - we would rather have that in our city than not," de Blasio said.

Early Facebook investor: We’ve been ‘Zucked’

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Roger McNamee wants to give Mark Zuckerberg a chance to redeem himself.
Another chance, that is.
Perched on a low stage in a rehabbed industrial space in Lower Manhattan, McNamee — an early Facebook adviser — slams the way Facebook’s founder does business.
“Move fast, break things, apologize, repeat,” says McNamee, who looks boyish despite his black pinstriped suit and his 62 years.
“They’ve been doing it from Day One. It’s culturally built in.”
And that’s all a part of what he describes as the Silicon Valley way: “Ship the product and let the consumers find the bugs.”
Of course, with Facebook, the “bugs” have been more like democracy-destroying monsters. McNamee - a famed venture capitalist who still owns shares of Facebook — knows this full well.
But the pointed criticism of Zuckerberg and his chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg in his new book, “Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe,” is meant to make things better, he says.
And, as McNamee told a crowd of 240 people Wednesday evening at Betaworks, a tech incubator, he resists the idea that Zuckerberg and Sandberg should resign their posts over the company’s well-known disasters: its privacy breaches, its enabling of liars and haters, its help to Russian hackers. (As a New York Times Book Review of “Zucked” put it: “Considering the high likelihood that Russian activity on Facebook may have tipped the 2016 election to Donald Trump, the damage is already of generational measure.”)
Yet McNamee still has a modicum of faith in the Facebook founder and Sandberg, his top aide, drawing a laugh with his tepid vote of confidence: “I believe they are one good night’s sleep from getting this.”
And besides, he says, until Facebook’s rapacious business model changes - probably only as a result of much-needed government regulation - no new leadership would make a difference anyway.
He writes: “The business model depends on advertising, which in turn depends on manipulating the attention of users so they see more ads. One of the best ways to manipulate attention is to appeal to outrage and fear, emotions that increase engagement.”
Facebook has responded consistently to McNamee’s takedown by pointing out he hasn’t had a meaningful role there for many years and the company has made strides on protecting consumers and otherwise cleaning up its act.
At the Betaworks book talk, CNN tech correspondent Laurie Segall - her documentary, “Facebook at 15: It’s Complicated,” airs Sunday night - read the canned response aloud.
Zuckerberg and McNamee were once fairly close, maybe even mentor and mentee.
At the very least, McNamee takes credit, though perhaps it should be seen as blame, for advising Zuckerberg not to sell the company early on.
Later, when he tried to warn them about what was happening in 2016 - his fear that bad actors were exploiting Facebook’s audience - he says they turned a deaf ear. And they haven’t spoken since.
In recent days, McNamee has been energetically flogging his book - on “Fox & Friends” one moment, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” another.
And in his travels, he preaches an anti-Facebook gospel: The value of getting out to meet people face to face, especially people you might not agree with.
“My whole thing is ‘let’s get together,’” says the man who describes himself as a former “tech nerd” who carried seven mobile devices. (McNamee, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area, is also the frontman of a roots-rock band, Moonalice, whose best-known song is “It’s 4:20 Somewhere,” and his venture capital firm, Elevation, boasted U2’s lead singer, Bono, as an early business partner.)
But despite the harsh criticism of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, and his disgust with the worst crimes of social media platforms, there are limits to his disdain.
McNamee not only still owns Facebook shares — the company posted record profits last month — he still counts himself among the behemoth’s more than two billion users.
The idea of his coming off Facebook altogether? Unthinkable, really.
After all, McNamee acknowledges with a shrug and a smile, “I’ve got a book to promote.”

Texto completo: In addition to having all the best words, knowing more about ISIS than his generals and more about technology that "anyone," President Trump figures he "probably" works more than any other President.
The commander-in-chief, a noted TV enthusiast, spent part of his Sunday tweeting about an Axios report last week stating he spends nearly 60% of his workday on unstructured, unaccounted for "executive time."
"The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative," the President tweeted Sunday afternoon. "When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President."
The report indicated Trump logged just under 502 hours of work during the three months Axios reviewed. More than 298 of those hours were dedicated to "Executive time," which ate up most of his schedule. The President reportedly spent 77 hours in meetings, which finished a distant second in time-fillers. Trump spent 39 hours eating lunch.
The report cites six sources claiming the President wakes at 6 a.m., but says his time is generally not accounted for prior to 11 a.m.
Trump watches an average of four hours of TV a day and sometimes twice that much, according to a New York Times report from December 2017. He's a known fan and frequent guest of "Fox & Friends," which airs weekdays at 6 a.m.
The President argued at the time he spends more time "reading documents" than watching TV, despite the 60-inch flat screen he had installed in his dining room, according to Time magazine.
A site called Trumpgolf.com estimates the President has fit 165 golf outings into his schedule since taking office in January 2017.
"He's always up to something; it's just not what you would consider typical structure," a White House source reportedly told Axios. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly is credited with designating the President's unstructured hours as "executive time."
Politico reported Friday that White House officials were busily searching for the source that leaked the President's "easy to obtain" schedule.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lashed out at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in a wide-ranging speech last week, criticizing the agency he effectively controls for its inefficiency and outdated technology.
Though the thrust of Mr. Cuomo's speech pushed for congestion pricing, he took particular aim at the transit authority for its decision-making related to cleaning subway stations.
"My favorite M.T.A. decision -- because you have to laugh, otherwise you cry -- is the one they made to pick a product to clean the subway stations," Mr. Cuomo said Thursday, accompanied by a photoshopped image of a man cleaning the floor of a subway station. "What product did they pick? Tide. Yes, the same Tide detergent you use at home to wash your clothes. If it's got to be clean, it's got to be Tide."
Mr. Cuomo's criticism, however, did not seem to register with some riders. The New York Times spoke to nearly two dozen riders on Sunday, none of whom were aware of Mr. Cuomo's comments.
But most agreed about the state of the subways: They are filthy, and it does not matter how they are cleaned. Riders just want to see improvements.
"It's pretty gross," William Sit, 32, said. "It's not uncommon to have puke on the floor or even on the train as a smell."
Standing on the platform for the Q train at the 72nd Street Station, Mr. Sit, a Brooklyn resident, said the cleanliness of stations varies drastically. The newer stations, like one at 72nd Street that opened two years ago, are cleaner.
"It's not getting better," said Cynthia Morgan, a 66-year-old from New Rochelle, N.Y., who was waiting for the shuttle at Times Square. "It's a daily experience."
While M.T.A. officials did not directly address Mr. Cuomo's criticism, they did acknowledge that too many stations are "unacceptably dirty," and said the M.T.A. is taking steps to address it.
"It was clear that the old methods simply weren't working, and this new, different and urgent approach will provide our customers with the service and experience they deserve," Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said in a statement.
In January, the M.T.A., as part of the Subway Action Plan to improve the system, allocated funds for a one-time effort to clean and refurbish 100 stations and up to 3,000 cars. The M.T.A spent $9.5 million on outside contractors to perform the work.
"The fact that the M.T.A. is using Tide to clean the subways punctuates the point that a fundamental overhaul in approach and management is needed," Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement.
A spokesman for the M.T.A said Tide was used before the new cleaning initiatives.
Riders seemed concerned whether the subways could be kept clean as a result of the large number of homeless riders.
Several said they have noticed an increase in the number of people sleeping on the trains. The subway has long been a refuge for homeless people looking to stay warm during the winter months.
"The smell of the homeless -- it's very sad," said Martha Carrillo, a 66-year-old resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, who expressed sympathy for their condition but said people who sleep on the subway often bring unpleasant odors.
Richie Johnstone, a 26-year-old Manhattan resident, said he has had to switch train cars because of the smell.
"I had one experience where I walked on the car with my girlfriend and there was a homeless man sleeping there, and the subway car smelled so bad that there was literally not a single person on the car," Mr. Johnstone said. "Everyone walked on and walked back off and got on the next one."
Kathryn Katz, a frequent visitor to New York City from New Haven, Conn., was one of the few riders who said she had seen improvements in subway cleanliness over the past few decades.
"I remember the subways back in the 50s and 60s with rats and everything," Ms. Katz, 70, said. "It's significantly cleaner.
She added: "Considering the amount of volume of people going through, it's just amazing that it's as clean as it is. You think there'd be trash all over the place."

An Encyclopedic Explosion of Baby-Boomer Touchstone Moments

Texto completo: All books have family trees, and you don't need a DNA swab to start drawing one for David Bowman's posthumously published novel, "Big Bang," which has at least two screamingly obvious progenitors: Don DeLillo's "Libra" and "Underworld." Like those novels, Bowman's is firmly planted in midcentury America, preoccupied with history's tectonic plates and stuffed with real-life characters.
Bowman nods very directly to this influence, introducing DeLillo as a minor character when the future author was a young copywriter at an advertising firm. We later see DeLillo at a performance by the comedian Lenny Bruce, who makes searing, unforgettable appearances in "Underworld."
Bowman's novel begins with the Kennedy assassination. Ann-Margret and Elvis end up watching the murder's aftermath on the news with some of the King's retinue. In the ensuing chapter, we're in Mexico City in 1950, with the C.I.A. operative Howard Hunt, the novelist William Burroughs and the "steroid man" Carl Djerassi, one of the scientists who helped create the birth-control pill.
As Bowman himself might write, in his playful, interjection-dotted way: Let's back up.
Bowman was an abundantly talented writer (maybe too abundantly; hang on) with an abundance of bad luck. He suffered a near-fatal accident in 1989, hit by a truck while walking in Montauk, on Long Island. In 2012, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage at 54. In the intervening years, he published three books, including two novels. His first, "Let the Dog Drive" (1992), a manic riff on road trips and detective novels, garnered attention for its mixture of absurdist humor and grim violence. In The Times, Tim Sandlin said it was written with "unstructured, unrepentant energy."
Bowman certainly put a lot of energy into casting "Big Bang," which you may find overpopulated even if you like crowds. The novel's central nervous system is formed around American politics -- it ends as well as begins with Kennedy's death, and spends considerable time on the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and Watergate. But J.F.K., Jacqueline Kennedy, Aristotle Onassis, Richard Nixon and Ngo Dinh Diem are joined in this story by -- among others -- Jimi Hendrix, Bruce Lee, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Dr. Benjamin Spock and his wife, Jane, George Plimpton, Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe, the literary critic Leslie Fiedler, J. D. Salinger, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, Willem de Kooning, Elizabeth Taylor, Raymond Chandler, Sylvia Plath, Jack Kerouac, Frank Sinatra and Maria Callas.
The events recounted in "Big Bang" include, but are far from limited to: Mailer stabbing his wife, Burroughs shooting his wife, Rosemary Kennedy's lobotomy, Khrushchev at Disneyland, the director John Huston making "The Misfits," Fidel Castro's appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show," Nixon playing the piano on "The Jack Paar Show," the release of the Ford Edsel, Montgomery Clift nearly dying in a car wreck after leaving a dinner party in the Hollywood Hills and, for about the blink of an eye, a young George W. Bush in the car with his mother, Barbara, after she has suffered a miscarriage.
If this review is beginning to seem encyclopedic in nature, it is simply mirroring the book. "Big Bang" resembles a baby boomer clearing house. Set between 1950 and 1963, there are moments when it seems intended to be a real-time account of the entire period.
This creates a paradoxical sensation in the reading experience. Individual pages and the brief scenes zoom by; but somewhere around halfway through, this nearly 600-page book begins to feel endless. Bowman gets approximately 250 plates spinning in the air, and they mostly just keep spinning.
We're shown a metric ton or two in this book, but almost all of it passes by as if on a screen. There is a consistently straightforward description of things, as in this example: "Ruth moves in with Pollock. They go to Long Island highbrow art parties and all the women cluster around Pollock. Ruth is ignored. She is a few extra pounds heavy. She has dark ratty hair."
Scenes are frequently begun with terse lines telling us where we are in the action. "Seattle, Washington. Buster Hendrix was now in sixth grade." "Los Angeles, California, New Year's Eve." "A jump cut to the interior of a fancy townhouse."
But we never really jump to the interior of a person, very rarely getting the soul inside the boldface name.
During this vast assembly, there are plenty of examples of Bowman's talent. As in his previous works, he's funny. "Dogs were not considered sentient in 1952," he writes, by way of explaining that pets were believed to have no souls. "In the 1950s, many were glad of this. It meant the family dog would not go to hell. Americans were innocent about dogs back then. Dogs themselves were innocent. Most dogs." And he knows his country well. In a speech about movies, Howard Hughes says: "You have to understand about westerns. People who go to them don't care whether they're good or bad. It's like going to a baseball game. The difference between a good and bad western is infinitesimal. People go to a western for American comfort."
This novel, like Bowman's other work but even more strenuously, tries to capture what Philip Roth famously called the "indigenous American berserk." (It's hardly Bowman's fault that the book is appearing at a time when berserk sounds relatively placid.) The title "Big Bang," in addition to referencing the Baby Boom ("this decade's relentless fecundity"), might also nod to the Kennedy assassination, and to the midcentury release of cultural energies that created what we now know as the postmodern American cosmos.
If Bowman was stuck in the America he was born into -- a country bound by "the unifying omnipotence of television," baseball on the radio, the conflict in Vietnam and the battle (real and imagined) against commies at home -- "Big Bang" at least represents a welcome interest in our history past the current news cycle.
No review of it is complete without mentioning its terrific introduction by Jonathan Lethem, a friend of Bowman's. In fact, DeLillo's most delightful appearance in the book comes when Lethem recalls receiving a "writing charm" from Bowman in the mail: an image of the Rockettes, with DeLillo's head pasted atop each dancer's body.
In his warm and vivid mini-biography, Lethem gets across how brilliant, charismatic and maddening Bowman could be. Those aren't bad adjectives for his books either. He was a writer with a tankful of high-octane gas and a less than ideal feel for the brakes. In all of his novels, there's vitality, humor and imagination that deserve to be remembered.

Nikki Haley to be star guest at dinner with top GOP donors

Texto completo: Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is reportedly slated to be the star guest at a dinner this month with New York’s top Republican donors.

Haley is expected to be honored at the Feb. 27 dinner organized by hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Axios reported Sunday. The event is part of a series designed to highlight surrogates ahead of the 2020 House and Senate elections.

Singer aims to recruit female candidates to support Republicans’ efforts to keep control of the Senate and take back the majority in the House, which the GOP lost after the November midterm elections. The hedge fund magnate is also backing E-PAC, a new political action committee started by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., designed to find female candidates for office.

Haley, who served as governor of South Carolina before joining the Trump administration, announced her decision in October to resign her post as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and ultimately left the position at the end of 2018.

Haley’s attendance at the upcoming dinner in New York led conservative commentator Bill Kristol to suggest top GOP donors may consider her a candidate to primary President Trump in 2020.

“Alarm bells going off in Trump world as Nikki Haley to be guest of honor at top GOP dinner. Ostensible purpose: ‘To spotlight key surrogates for the congressional races of 2020.’ Effectual truth: To spotlight a possible replacement for Trump in 2020,” Kristol tweeted Sunday.

But political journalists were quick to dismiss the suggestion Haley would challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. When Haley announced her resignation in October, she said she was not running for president in 2020.

“There’s little doubt that Haley would be a likely candidate IF Trump didn’t run in 2020 for one reason or another. There is a whole lot of doubt that she would try to primary Trump. Either way, she reconnects with a donor network that she has ties to through this dinner,” New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman tweeted.

“0% chance Nikki Haley primaries Trump in 2020,” Politico White House reporter Eliana Johnson said in a tweet.

Poetry at the center of life

Texto completo: There might be little left to say about Robert Bly, the poet, critic, translator and nonagenarian whose astonishing "Collected Poems" is now available. Ever since 1962, when "Silence in the Snowy Fields" established him as a poet of desperate sincerity, he has been a paragon of Jungianism against the brutality of capitalism and militancy. He's hardly changed. But everything else has, and with it the significance of a poet who believes that poems should be near the center of life.
Bly was born in 1926 in a Norwegian Lutheran community in Minnesota, the son of a farmer. He served in the Navy during World War II and entered Harvard as a 21-year-old sophomore in 1947. It is superfluous to say that Bly is one of the legends of contemporary poetry, which never got over its bewilderment at producing him; reasonably or not, he remains the prototypical non-modernist, the one who set in motion a poetics of intensity for generations to come. His methods were mined and sifted by peers. The use of the poem as a luminous mat was gleaned by W.S. Merwin; as a field for erotic surprise by Galway Kinnell; as an awakening into consciousness and moral decency by James Wright and William Stafford.
Bly rejects dcor. What you see throughout "Collected Poems," this 532-page retrospective of 14 books and some 600 poems, is that he is not interested in covering an entire poem with incidents, but in hierarchies of emphasis, beginning with longing. He offers little interest in the hedonism of thought championed by his Harvard classmate John Ashbery. Instead, Bly's precinct of the imagination is like a womb of consciousness: "Inside me there is a confusion of swallows,/Birds flying through the smoke."
Here lay ambiguity, tangibility, the scrutiny of tiny passages of existence abounding in a pastoral field, all with the intensity of fairy tale. The title Bly gave his most enchantingly atmospheric collection, "The Man in the Black Coat Turns," about sums it up.
In early poems such as "Surprised by Evening," "Driving Toward the Lac Qui Parle River," "The Shadow Goes Away," "The Grief of Men," one sees the translucency with which he traces the patterns of spiritual renewal. It is what his imitators fail to do, those who can't match his almost supernatural control over the total effect of an image as representative of thought and depth of emotion:
"The evening … has come through the nets of the stars,/Through the tissues of the grass,/Walking quietly over the asylums of the waters."
This language illustrates what's known as the Deep Image in American poetry, where light and darkness are always idealized and memory is absolutely spontaneous, a perfected visual analogue to the cry of the psyche, where "our skin shall see far off, as it does underwater."
No wonder audiences were stunned by his anti-Vietnam War book, "The Light Around the Body," which won the National Book Award in 1968, a year that saw the deaths of nearly 17,000 Americans and an estimated 180,000 Vietnamese. The best poems in that book are triumphs of reserve, where his drive to preserve the essences of human reality under assault leaves no doubt of the strength of his conviction about a nation gone berserk, beset by discrimination, poverty, mass marches, riots and war: "Let's count the bodies over …/If we could only make the bodies smaller …/We could make a whole plain white with skulls in the moonlight."
Because American democracy is again under threat, coming apart with chaos and bloodshed, I urge you to read what Bly said the night he won the award. Addressing "gross and savage crimes" by the government, he said institutions would have to preserve the nation, and risk "committing acts of disobedience." Donating his prize check to the draft-resistance movement, Bly urged young men "not to destroy their spiritual lives by participating in this war."
You cannot read Bly's poetry without appreciating his belief that cultural integration might redeem us all. Nowhere is that more apparent than in his translations of several centuries of European, Middle Eastern and South American poets, especially Pablo Neruda, whom Bly considered the greatest poet of the 20th century. You won't find any translations in "Collected Poems" -- a shame, since in those translations there is something more than just an echo of his focus on the nature of a capacious imagination:
"Night after night goes by in the old man's head./We try to ask new questions. But whatever/The old poets failed to say will never be said."
In hindsight, the trajectory is pretty direct from Deep Imagism to political poetry to "Iron John" -- with its attacks against corporate visions of masculinity -- to his recent apologues of the unconscious. But the popular success and controversy of "Iron John" resulted in Bly being kicked out of the insular American poetry community for the crime of being too influential in the broader public. For decades few literary magazines have reviewed his new books.
How can one read "Collected Poems," then, from its first wintry still lifes, whose lyricism is as clean as snow falling onto bare trees, through the grapplings with injustice, to the mannered ghazals of the last decades, without seeing that Bly's career is one of the few great models of integrating the citizen with the mystic, whose body of work makes the argument that being a poet does not excuse you from joining in the national debate?
By my reading, Bly's best poems are sketched with earnestness, with reverence to self-authority, and with the subtle and strange forces of myth, where intricate connections of disparate motifs reveal the terrors and charms of the world. In his fashion, he makes metaphors for grace. Compared with that, the big, popular blunderbuss of Bly hardly matters.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address and the Democratic response given by Georgia politician Stacey Abrams on Tuesday had fact checkers on overdrive.
While each speech included some false information, according to reports, we compare the claims Trump and Abrams made concerning employment and the economy.
‘Best in decades’ claim doesn’t actually add up The president’s speech included claims that contrasted with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, according to The Washington Post.
Trump said, "Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades."
Wages were up 3.1 percent last year, according to one Labor Department measure of employment that doesn’t take inflation into account, the Post said. That figure represents the largest increase since December 2008.
However, according to the Labor Department, pay for all workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.3 percent from December 2017 to December 2018, the largest increase since only August 2016, the Post said.
"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs," Trump said.
This is in contrast to the 4.9 million jobs created, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, because the timelines differ, the Post said. While the BLS data for Trump’s administration began on Jan. 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, the president’s claim reflects numbers going back to Election Day 2016, when former President Barack Obama still had more than two months left on his term, the Post said.
Abrams’ figures don’t jibe with labor statistics While giving the Democratic response, Abrams said the Republican tax bill "rigged the system" against the working class.
"Families’ hopes are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn’t understand it," said Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 race for governor of Georgia.
But the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates nonfarming jobs have increased by nearly 4.9 million since Trump took office and are up 3 million since the tax law began, according to USA Today.
The Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect in December 2017.
Abrams claimed "plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living."
USA Today reports manufacturing employment rose by 454,000 jobs under the Trump administration and 277,000 jobs since the tax law.
Abrams said, "wages struggle to keep pace" with the cost of living. As of December, USA Today said, inflation-adjusted earnings for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers were up 2.6 percent since Trump became president and 1.4 percent since December 2017.
Although manufacturing companies have closed and there have been layoffs, overall, employment numbers have risen since Trump took office in January 2017, according to USA Today.
Stone arrest not bigger than bin Laden raid Following the early-morning arrest of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone on Jan. 25, Stone was charged with obstruction, making false statements to investigators and one count of witness tampering, a ccording to the Associated Press.
Within days of the arrest, stories circulating on Facebook claimed Special Council Robert Mueller sent more FBI agents to arrest Stone than the number of military personnel sent to get Osama bin Laden in 2011, AP said.
One Facebook post asked, "Does that tell you how out of control Mueller is(?)" But the 48 members of SEAL Team 6 participating in the highly sophisticated secret military raid on bin Laden’s Pakistan compound far outnumbered the 12 FBI agents who executed the pre-dawn arrest of Stone at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, AP said.
The mission to apprehend bin Laden involved two specially engineered Black Hawk helicopters, each carrying 23 SEALs and an interpreter, and a tracking dog named Cairo, according to AP.
Stone, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, said the "over the top" raid at his home was unnecessary because he would have voluntarily surrendered through his lawyer, AP said.
Brady, Belichick kissing photo is a phony The New England Patriots, who defeated the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, once again were crowned NFL champions and a fake meme of quarterback Tom Brady kissing coach Bill Belichick on the lips once again made the rounds on Facebook.
The image first showed up after the Patriots won the 2015 Super Bowl, according to Snopes.com. Earlier this month it resurfaced as part of a collage that included a real photo of Brady kissing his father during the 2017 Super Bowl celebration and a 2019 screen grab in which Brady is seen embracing team owner Robert Kraft.
The Brady/Belichick photo is a digitally doctored fake created by combining photos of the two men kissing other people, Snopes said.
The image of Brady was taken from a New York Times photo of the quarterback kissing his mother in the aftermath of the 2015 championship win, Snopes said. The Belichick image was taken from a photo of the coach kissing his daughter, also during the 2015 celebration, which ran on the Fox Sports website.
Parts of each photo were cropped, rotated or flipped to create the fake image, Snopes said.

Texto completo: Learning new choreography is always a challenge, but for Ballet Arizona standout Rochelle Anvik, preparing for the title role in Stravinsky's "The Firebird" with artistic director Ib Andersen has been something else entirely.
"Ib was definitely like, 'No bird-type movements,' which is what you would expect of 'The Firebird,'" she says. "He kept saying, 'Be like an alien,' and I'm like, 'What is that?' And so he's like, 'I don't know, think more like an octopus.'"
Andersen has reimagined any number of classic fairy-tale ballets in his 19 years in Phoenix. His "Nutcracker" was named one of three best in the country by the New York Times. But a brand-new "Firebird," which premieres Valentine's Day at Symphony Hall, might be his biggest departure from tradition, transforming the Russian folk tale about a prince and a magical bird into a science-fiction fantasia with panoramic video projections creating a dreamy landscape unlike anything on Earth.
"I'm completely discarding the history," Andersen says. "I'm to a degree discarding the story. I like the music."
Born in Copenhagen, Andersen danced with the Royal Danish Ballet before moving on to New York City Ballet, where he was one of the last principle dancers to create roles for the visionary choreographer George Balanchine. At Ballet Arizona, he has earned international acclaim both for restaging Balanchine and for his own choreography in a similarly modern style.
One of his greatest champions has been Alastair Macauley, the recently retired dance critic for the New York Times. Macauley has traveled to Phoenix several times to see new productions, most recently "Eroica" in the round at the Desert Botanical Garden. (His verdict? "This strikes me as one of the most enterprising companies anywhere.")
"With some kind of craziness, I went all around America seeing at least 27 productions of 'Nutcracker,' and Ib Andersen's was absolutely one of the three best I discovered outside of New York," Macauley says.
"He has a range and just professional skill that puts him above most others working around the country. ... He really shows off good dancers. They're rigorous in their use of ballet technique."
Andersen's "Cinderella" in 2011, for example, may have had a traditional fairy-tale look, but the choreography was refreshingly original, Macauley says:
"The Prokofiev score is a very complicated score, and I've seen much more celebrated choreographers, notably Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon and David Bintley, all handle that score less well than Ib Andersen did, so that really impressed me. ...
"If I could have had my way, I would have traveled to Arizona more often to see him."

Today's Highlight in History:
On Feb. 9, 1964, The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show, broadcast from New York on CBS.
On this date:
In 1825, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams president after no candidate received a majority of electoral votes.In 1861, Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president of the Confederate States of America at a congress held in Montgomery, Alabama.In 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff held its first formal meeting to coordinate military strategy during World War II. Daylight-saving "War Time went into effect in the United States, with clocks moved one hour forward. The SS Normandie, a former French liner being refitted for the U.S. Navy at a New York pier, caught fire (it capsized early the next morning).In 1943, the World War II battle of Guadalcanal in the southwest Pacific ended with an Allied victory over Japanese forces.In 1950, in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., charged that the State Department was riddled with Communists.In 1960, Adolph Coors Co. chairman Adolph Coors III, 44, was shot to death in suburban Denver during a botched kidnapping attempt. (The man who killed him, Joseph Corbett Jr., served 19 years in prison.)In 1964, the G.I. Joe action figure was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York.In 1971, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in California's San Fernando Valley claimed 65 lives. The crew of Apollo 14 returned to Earth after man's third landing on the moon.In 1984, Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov, 69, died 15 months after succeeding Leonid Brezhnev; he was followed by Konstantin U. Chernenko (chehr-NYEN'-koh).In 2005, Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Carly Fiorina was forced out by board members, ending her nearly six-year reign.In 2017, a federal appeals court refused to reinstate President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, unanimously rejecting the administration's claim of presidential authority, questioning its motives and concluding that the order was unlikely to survive legal challenges.Ten years ago: President Barack Obama used his first news conference since taking office to urgently pressure lawmakers to approve a massive economic recovery bill. New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs, telling ESPN he'd used banned substances while with the Texas Rangers for three years. Lindsey Vonn won the downhill for her second gold at the World Championships in Val D'isere, France, becoming the second American woman (after Andrea Mead Lawrence) to win two golds at a worlds. Playwright Robert Anderson ("Tea and Sympathy) died in New York at age 91.Five years ago: Despite a wave of online protests, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark killed a healthy male giraffe named "Marius because of rules imposed by a European zoo association to deter inbreeding. Host country Russia won its first gold medal of the Sochi Olympics, winning the team figure skating event; Matthias Mayer of Austria won the men's downhill. Missouri All-American Michael Sam came out to the nation as an openly gay player in published interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports.

Texto completo: A second woman came forward Friday to accuse Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, alleging he raped her in 2000 while they were students at Duke University.
The revelation prompted several calls for the lieutenant governor to resign, with one Virginia delegate saying he would introduce articles of impeachment for Fairfax on Monday.
Fairfax, in a statement, denied the woman's allegation.
"It is demonstrably false," Fairfax said. "I have never forced myself on anyone ever."
Meredith Watson released details of the alleged assault through a statement from her attorney, Nancy Erika Smith.
The statement said that Watson shared her account of the assault with friends in a series of emails and Facebook messages. Watson also "immediately" told friends that Fairfax had raped her, Smith said.
"Mr. Fairfax's attack was premeditated and aggressive," the statement reads. "The two were friends but never dated or had any romantic relationship."
"At this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character," Smith said in a statement Friday.
"She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages."
Watson wants Fairfax to resign from office, Smith said.
Later Friday night, Smith released a second statement in response to what she said was an attempt by Fairfax to discredit Watson.
"We have heard from numerous press sources that ... Mr. Fairfax has chosen to attack his victim again, now smearing her with the typical 'she's nuts' defense," Smith wrote. "He revealed that Ms. Watson was the victim of a prior rape. She was."
The statement goes on to claim that Watson was raped during her sophomore year at Duke.
Smith asserted that Fairfax, knowing of the prior rape, said to Watson, "I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you'd be too afraid to say anything."
Asking for an investigation, Fairfax called Watson's account "unsubstantiated and false allegations."
"I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide," Fairfax said in his statement. "I have passed two full field background checks by the FBI and run for office in two highly contested elections with nothing like this being raised before."
He called the accusation a "vicious and coordinated smear campaign" being orchestrated against him.
"I will not resign," he said.
A friend who attended Duke with Watson recalled how Watson came to her crying in the spring of 2000, The Washington Post reported. The friend, Kaneedreck Adams, who is now an attorney, lived across from Watson in a campus apartment.
"She was upset," Adams said. "She told me she had been raped and she named Justin."
The alleged attack took place at a fraternity house, the Post reported.
The Post also included an email exchange between Watson and another friend from Duke from two years ago in which Watson wrote about the assault.
The Republican Party of Virginia on Friday afternoon called for an investigation of the new allegations and a number of current and former Virginia lawmakers said Fairfax needs to resign.
"The allegations against Justin Fairfax are serious and credible," said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Twitter. "It is clear to me that he can no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia as Lieutenant Governor."
Del. Patrick Hope, a Democrat from Arlington, said on Twitter that he plans to introduce the articles of impeachment on Monday - unless Fairfax has stepped down by then.
Reached Friday night by phone, Hope said that reading Tyson's account was painful. It's when he saw Watson's statement that he started thinking about impeachment.
"Just seeing the second (accusation) come out, even though we had been told there was no one else coming out, tells me this is a pattern of behavior unfit for office," Hope said.
U.S. Reps. Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, Jennifer Wexton, Don Beyer and Gerry Connolly - all from Virginia - issued a joint statement saying Watson's statement lends further credence to the account provided by Vanessa Tyson, who has accused Fairfax of sexually assaulting her 15 years ago.
"The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia presides over the Virginia Senate and must be prepared to fill the role of Governor," the group wrote in their statement. "It is unacceptable that either of these weighty responsibilities be entrusted to someone who has engaged in the behavior described by Dr. Tyson and Meredith Watson."
Senate Republican leaders called for police investigations in North Carolina and Massachusetts following the accusations from Watson and Tyson. The statute of limitations in Massachusetts for sexual assault is 15 years. The Democratic National Convention was held from July 26-29 in 2004.
"We are shocked and dismayed by these credible and serious allegations," the leaders wrote in a joint statement.
House and Senate Democrats also called for Fairfax's resignation, saying "the time has come for him to step down."
Watson's account comes on the heels of a lengthy statement from Tyson, who has said she met Fairfax in Boston at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. It was there that he sexually assaulted her in his hotel room, she said.
In an article published Friday, The New York Times reported Tyson told five friends about the assault in different degrees of detail over the past two years.
Three of those people told the newspaper that Tyson, a professor at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., identified her attacker to the people as Justin Fairfax, a lieutenant governor or a politician on the rise, according to the report.
According to the Times, Tyson told a number of colleagues during a lunch group last fall that she had been sexually assaulted years earlier. She told the group during the start of a fellowship at Stanford.
Tyson told them about having been blindsided by her assailant, the Times reported, quoting Elizabeth A. Armstrong, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan.
"What she told us was pretty much exactly what was in the statement that she released but with vastly less detail," Armstrong told the newspaper.
Watson's attorney on Friday released an email exchange to the Post between Watson and a friend at Duke. In the 2016 exchange, the friend, Milagros Joye Brown, was inviting a group of friends from Duke to a fundraiser for Fairfax as he started his campaign for lieutenant governor.
"Molly, Justin raped me in college and I don't want to hear anything about him. Please, please, please remove me from any future emails about him please," Watson wrote on Oct. 26, 2016.

Texto completo: California’s housing crisis was bad enough last year, when Gov. Gavin Newsom – then a mere candidate – called for building 350,000 new units every year for the next decade.
The crunch is worse this year, with some of those who lost their homes to last fall’s disastrous wildfires now added to the tens of thousands already homeless and living on streets around the state and hundreds of thousands more who are housed, but overcrowded beyond the limits of many local codes.
This scene last year led San Francisco’s Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener to push a proposed law allowing builders to override local zoning ordinances and place high-rise apartment buildings with a plenitude of “affordable” units near light rail stations or heavily used bus routes.
This proposal didn’t last long in the Legislature last year, shot down by a coalition of local governments, homeowner groups and lack of enthusiasm by former Gov. Jerry Brown, an advocate of local government controls since his years as mayor of Oakland.
But there is more pressure now to override local controls on development, and Wiener is back with a slightly redone version of his building plan, which would reverse a century of California urban sprawl by concentrating development in areas long believed to be built out.
Wiener has touted the changes he’s made to his proposal for the last couple of months, stressing ways the newer version panders to the desires of left-wing “progressives” dissatisfied with the previous version.
Now known as SB 50, the measure would let cities delay building in areas where longstanding apartment tenants might be at risk of eviction to make way for newly-mandated high rises. If a tenant has been in a building more than seven years, for example, that building couldn’t be demolished to make way for a new, far taller one.
This is meant to appease tenant groups that dominate politics in cities like Santa Monica, San Francisco and other currently dense places.
But the essence of Wiener’s original plan remains: It allows new buildings of six to eight stories in all areas within half a mile of any light-rail station or within one-quarter mile of a frequently used bus route. Preferences of local voters, city or county governments and nearby homeowners or apartment dwellers wouldn’t matter.
As Wiener says, such development could probably never occur unless the state mandated it. Few local officials could survive politically if they okayed high-rises overlooking the yards of thousands of single-family homes or caused the teardowns of expensive condominiums.
But Wiener claims many elected officials tell him they want dense development, but can’t publicly admit it. He told the New York Times that “City councils, mayors, county supervisors have (told) me ‘We can’t say this, but we need help. We need to be able to tell our constituents ‘We have to approve this project because the state requires it.’”
But just as the state’s high-speed rail project has seen years of delay and opposition over attempts to take land by eminent domain, forced new development could also run into legal buzz saws. Especially new development with virtually no new parking spaces required.
For example, Wiener’s plan is founded on the notion that denser housing won’t worsen gridlocked traffic because new residents will ride nearby trains and buses. Figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Southern California suggest that’s pie in the sky.
The bus and light rail agency reported last year that bus ridership shrank in the region by 15 percent in 2017 from levels of five years earlier, while rail ridership was up 4 million – less than the drop in bus ridership. Translation: there’s been some switching from buses to trains, but little net increase in mass transit riders despite creation of several new lines costing billions of dollars.
So the logic behind Wiener’s plan remains false and would worsen existing gridlock in cities he wants to densify. It ignores many thousands of homeowners who invested their life savings in residences Wiener’s plan could radically downgrade.
The bottom line: Some other solution must be sought, because it accomplishes little to begin solving one serious problem while making other problems far worse.

Texto completo: I'm about two years older than Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, 59, and I've never put on blackface makeup - not as a high school or college student, not as a young adult, not ever.
Neither have any of my friends to my knowledge. And I've never been to a costume party where someone came in blackface.
Not that I've always been ostentatiously enlightened on the subject. I can't remember having a conversation or even giving it any thought in the mid-1980s - when, as we've learned, Northam used shoe polish to darken his white skin thinking it would be entertaining - about how poisonous and offensive blackface is to African-Americans.
Yes, the subject was occasionally in the news back then. African-American actor and dancer Ben Vereen raised eyebrows and a bit of ire when he performed in blackface at the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan, with the anger magnified because the portion of his act that highlighted the connection between blackface and racist exploitation of blacks was not included in the TV broadcast.
White students who wore blackface makeup to a 1982 "Ghetto Function" fraternity party at an Oregon university avoided suspension by participating in a cultural awareness program, according to another story from the archives. A police officer in Baltimore was consigned to desk duty for having an off-hours gig where he put on blackface and performed as Al Jolson.
The Chicago Tribune barely mentioned the subject in the early '80s, and most of the references in the New York Times were mild asides in the paper's arts coverage - a 1981 dramatic review noted that the blackface was "unevenly and inexpertly applied," while a 1982 review of a ballet performance observed that the use of blackface "recalls a sensibility no longer valid."
In 1986, Hollywood released "Soul Man," a feature-length comedy about a white man who darkens his skin to receive a law school scholarship reserved for black students.
Meanwhile, a former Ku Klux Klan officer - Robert Byrd of West Virginia - was the highest ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate, while the highest ranking Republican was South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, who'd run for president in 1948 railing against the admission of "the negro race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes, and into our churches."
This was the cultural milieu in which Northam decided it would be a good idea to blacken up in order to imitate Michael Jackson at a dance contest (he now denies being in the 1984 medical school yearbook photo on his page that shows one person in blackface and another in a Klansman's hood).
Those calling for Northam's resignation who indignantly note that his offense occurred in 1984, not 1954, are romanticizing how woke the public was in 1984.
I'm inclined to chalk up Northam's decision to obliviousness rather than racism, particularly in light of his public record on race in the intervening 35 years, which even most of his African-American critics concede has been exemplary.
It is an obliviousness rooted in white privilege conferred by systemic racism, to be sure. And it often manifests itself as insensitivity - hence the ongoing need for cultural-awareness initiatives. Those who do not live as African-Americans, American Indians, Asian-Americans, Hispanics, LGBTQ people or other minorities can be poor judges of what's amusing to them or what they will take as compliments.
And ask any woman you know about manifestations of male privilege.
Entertainers in blackface ridiculed and often infantilized African-Americans and perpetuated their subjugation. This history is so toxic that intent can never justify its use, as actor Ted Danson learned when he was widely vilified for attempting to honor his then-girlfriend, African-American star Whoopi Goldberg, by wearing blackface for a skit in 1993.
But Danson has been allowed to return to respectability, as has Billy Crystal, who came under fire for darkening his face to imitate Sammy Davis Jr. for a bit at the 2012 Academy Awards show.
And so - given his expressions of remorse and lack of evidence of similar misdeeds in the intervening 35 years - should Northam. Even given his bizarre performance at Saturday's news conference and the strange evolution of his story about the Klansman photo, he's entitled to the forgiveness and second chance he's asked for.
Yes, he inadvertently and retrospectively caused pain to African-Americans by thoughtlessly wearing blackface in the mid-1980s. But if he has to resign for that, so should every politician of either party who supports holidays and public displays that honor the Confederacy, honors that cause ongoing pain to African-Americans.
So should Republicans who aren't calling for the resignation of white supremacist U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and of avowed female-genital-grabbing President Donald Trump.
The public is likely to realize this once the Next Big Outrage heaves into view and the pundits mount their high horses to charge after it.
At this writing, Northam seems to be heeding what I call "Roland's Rule" - the advice to sit tight during explosions of public indignation until everyone has calmed down and the calls for your head die off. I named it for Illinois politician Roland Burris, who calmly weathered the furious storm that followed his appointment to the U.S. Senate in late 2008 by Gov. Rod Blagojevich after Blagojevich's arrest on corruption charges.
It's a rule that has served Trump, Bill Clinton, Brett Kavanaugh and others in public who've bided their time until the flames on the torches of the masses burned out.
Virginia is not facing an emergency that demands a new governor today. If a month from now it still looks as if he can't be an effective governor or if the bill of particulars against him has grown, then yes, he should quit.
But not yet. Not for this.

Texto completo: TONIGHT'S MUST-TRY: Live From Lincoln Center," 9-10:30 p.m., PBS (check local listings).
There's an endless pipeline, Nya feels, sending young black men from public schools to prisons. As a passionate teacher, she tries to stop it, often futily. So she sent her son upstate, to a private school. Now comes devastating news: After attacking a teacher he considered racist, he may be expelled.
Can she pierce his rage? When "Pipeline" debuted at the Lincoln Center, critics raved about the play and its star, Karen Pittman. Variety called it "emotionally harrowing," he New York Times agreed, but said it's "frustratingly unresolved." Now TV viewers can get a burst of off-Broadway theater intensity.
TONIGHT'S MIGHT-SEE: "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," 9 p.m., CW.
Here's a different kind of theater-on-TV experience. Stuffed with musical-theater veterans, "Crazy" uses original songs – clever, quirky ones – in the midst of its comic/tragic stories.
It has often had Rebecca be self-consumed and self-destructive. But now a doctor has spotted what could have become a major heart attack for her friend Paula; Rebecca must set her own troubles aside.
TONIGHT'S ALTERNATIVE: "Hell's Kitchen" finale, 8 and 9 p.m., Fox.
Last week, Chris Motto took himself out of the competition, saying he wanted to return to being a chef in Baton Rouge. That leaves three people going for $250,000 and a Las Vegas job.
One finalist is Ariel Contreras-Fox, 35, of Brooklyn, who finished third in 2009. Tonight starts with Gordon Ramsay choosing between two Florida chefs for the second finalist spot: Mia Castro, 28, is on the show for the first time; Bret Hauser, 34, was there in 2015, but had to leave because of back spasms. Tonight, the final two prepare a massive meal at Six Flags Magic Mountain.
TONIGHT'S ALTERNATIVE II: "High Flying Bird," any time, Netflix.
Steven Soderbergh has had plenty pf success with full-budget movies, including two ("Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich") that had best-picture Oscar nominations the same year. But now he returns to his indie roots, for a movie shot on iPhone. Andre Holland plays a sports agent, trying a daring scheme.
That's on a busy night for the streaming services. Netflix also has the third season of the much-praised reboot of "One Day at a Time"; Hulu counters with "Pen15," a teen comedy for grown-ups.
Other choices include:
"The Sunshine Boys" (1975), 6 p.m. ET, Turner Classic Movies. George Burns was 80 when he won the Academy Award for this dandy Neil Simon comedy, making him (for a while) the oldest person to win an acting Oscar. In TCM's Oscar month, that's followed by two psychiatry dramas – Bette Davis' "Now, Voyager" (1942) at 8 p.m. ET and Barbra Streisand's "The Prince of Tides" (1991) at 10:15.
"Big Brother: Celebrity Edition," 8 p.m., CBS. It's a two-hour edition, setting up a one-hour show Monday and he two-hour finale Wednesday.
"Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown," 8 p.m., ABC. This 1975 classic finds holiday angst for Charlie, Sally and Lucy. Rounding out the hour are short Valentine bits, adapted from the "Peanuts" strip.
"Blindspot," 8 p.m., NBC. In an effort to save Jane, Patterson and Rich are on a Peruvian treasure hunt.
"The Blacklist," 9 p.m., NBC. Red (James Spader) has requested a psychiatric evaluation. That gives extra time for the half-sisters, Liz and Jennifer. Convinced that Red is an imposter who replaced their real father, they search for someone on the "blacklist" who may have key information.
"Blue Bloods," 10 p.m., CBS. Brothers collide when Danny goes against Jamie's direct order during a hostage negotiation. Also, their sister Erin is asked by Nicky to help a friend who may lose his scholarship for a crime he didn't commit. Their dad Frank helps a cop who shot a girl accidentally.

Tell-all: My mom ran numbers in Detroit

Texto completo: Bridgett M. Davis grew up with a secret she carried so long she almost forgot about it. It wasn't until 2009 when her son picked up a photo of Davis' mother from a table in their Brooklyn home and asked what his grandmother was like that it dawned on her how deeply that secret became part of her life.
Today she's telling all in a memoir, "The World According To Fannie Davis: My Mother's Life in the Detroit Numbers," about her mother's career as a bookie, running an illegal lottery from their house on the city's west side during the 1960s and '70s to support her five children and ailing husband who could no longer work.
Davis, the author of two novels and a professor of journalism and creative writing at Baruch College in New York, returns to Detroit for three events this weekend to talk about the book which debuted to much praise Jan. 29. Davis' first book of nonfiction, it's garnered more attention than she ever imagined, including three stories in the New York Times already.
For the 1978 graduate of Cass Tech High School who was the youngest of her siblings, the timing was right to shed the secret. At the time however, secrecy was vital to the family's ability to maintain a middle class lifestyle, including comfortable homes on Broad Street and later West Seven Mile, beautiful clothing and money for college.
More than once Davis had to openly lie about her mother's work, like the time her first grade teacher at Winterhalter Elementary School grilled the six-year-old about her apparent abundance of pretty shoes. Eventually the teacher demanded to know her father's profession. When Davis told her he couldn't work, the same question was asked about her mother. Davis replied, "I don't know," hoping she didn't mess up while feeling demeaned for having nice things.
Davis says her mother lived under constant worry of being wiped out if one of her customers hit it big costing her a big payout. And with all the cash Fannie had on hand in the home, she kept it in a safe in her closet and two guns nearby.
Known as "the numbers" years before the lottery became legal in 1972, the underground economy began in Harlem in the 1920s as a way for African Americans to make money and start businesses — and even seed the civil rights movement.
For Davis, now a wife and a mother of two teens, it was important to not just tell her mother's story in an illegal profession — she was the granddaughter of slaves who migrated to Detroit with her husband from Jim Crow Tennessee in the 1950s — but put it in context of life for African Americans at that time.
"I needed to make sure that I wasn't going to try to tell you how to feel about (my mother) but I absolutely was going to work hard to make sure you understood the context in which she lived so you understood her life."
Davis, who left Detroit after high school to attend Spelman College on Atlanta, chatted with the Free Press about the book.
QUESTION: Your mom was a rarity: both a bookie and a banker. What does that mean?
ANSWER: As a bookie you could play your numbers with her. You could bring them over on little slips of paper or call her and give her your numbers. She was also a banker. That meant if you won, my mom would pay off that hit. So with a 500 to one payout if you played 5-9-2 for 1 dollar and it came out you got $500. She built her business by collecting folks' bets and paying out when they hit and profiting from the difference when they didn't. This was replicated all over the city and clearly all over the country. What was unique is that my mom was to my knowledge really the only woman (in Detroit) banking the numbers for years.
Q: So how did the numbers factor into life in general for African Americans?
A: A lot of these numbers men in the '30s and '40s and '50s considered themselves race men. They were making a lot of money and believed they should use a lot of their largesse to benefit the race. They started all of these legitimate businesses that provided services that segregation and discrimination had kept black folks from having, like access to a room in a hotel in the city or life insurance without issues or gouging. One guy started a bowling alley, because hey, black folks like to bowl, too. ... The most important thing was that they infused this fledgling (Detroit) chapter of the NAACP with cash. ... Detroit was really a bedrock of the civil rights movement. Thank goodness that those numbers men made sure that those organizations were thriving.
Q: How much was your mom's role in that?
My mom believed deeply in two principles: help yourself and help others. ... She believed in those equally. She totally gave to the NAACP she gave to her church but the ways that I saw her give really was to people in her world, particularly young women. She had such a soft spot for girls and young women.
Q: What surprised you doing the book?
A: I did not know how many people she had helped. I didn't know that people I knew well had been helped by her because she never told me. And only in the interview did they reveal to me: "Oh yeah, that time I was struggling, your mom sent me $500."
Q: What lessons did you get from your mom?
A: No matter what you do, do it with integrity. ... People really wanted to play with her because they could trust her.
She had such a moral compass. I think without even understanding it I was absorbing sort of a code of ethics that has helped me in my life. ... She wasn't trying to get rich. She was trying to provide for her family, (not) make as much money as possible.
Q: What do you hope readers take away from this book?
A: How extraordinary and yet typical my mother was. She was like millions of black mothers in the 20th Century in this country trying to make a way out of no way and doing whatever it took to provide for their children. ... I also want people to applaud her ingenuity. That's what made her extraordinary. She really found a way to not just survive but to thrive.
Q: Has the book changed you?
A: I think there's this beautiful irony at play that I'm understanding. This secret that I held so tightly for decades because I was concerned about her being judged, it turns out our story is really resonating with people. That I'm learning anew every day. And it's like, Wow.

Cosby moved to 'general population' at Pa. prison; 'He's happy to be out socializing,' official says

Texto completo: Bill Cosby has been moved to "general population" at his state prison in Pennsylvania and is being treated the same as all inmates, a prison official told the New York Daily News on Thursday.
The move was made Jan. 28 after Cosby spent his first few months in "administrative segregation" at the maximum-security SCI Phoenix facility outside Philadelphia, said Amy Worden, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.
"From what I understand from prison officials, the transition has been smooth and he's happy to be out socializing with folks," she said.
She said Cosby - like other famous inmates including rapper Meek Mill and disgraced coach Jerry Sandusky - was "given the chance to acclimate" before staff determined he was ready to move into general population.
Now Cosby is in a single-person cell next to other inmates, must be present for daily counts and eats his meals in the dining hall associated with his particular unit, she said.
He also has access to the day room, the yard, the libraries and settings for religious activities, she said.
Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt disputed the claims in a statement to The News following a story in The New York Times that first reported the move.
"I spent time with Mr. Cosby Thursday and Friday of last week, we knew he was going to be moved to a Veteran's facility on the campus (of SCI Phoenix). He made it clear that he's not in general population but has contact with a trustee that guides him around," Wyatt said.
"He does not eat in the area with other residents; he does not have a cellmate; and he does not exercise with other residents," Wyatt said. "Mr. Cosby is not in general population because that would be detrimental to his safety and security, due to his blindness."
Wyatt then criticized prison officials for releasing information about Cosby's move, despite that such information is public record.
"It's not a matter of debate," Worden told The News when asked to respond to Wyatt's statement. "He misunderstands what general population is. You're either in it or not."
She said Cosby is most certainly classified as general population.
She declined to say if he's being housed in a facility serving veterans but said such a facility exists on the campus and serves inmates classified as general population.
"He's in a specialized unit, but I'm not going to say which one," she said.
Worden said such units include the "honor" unit and units for inmates with special needs.
Beyond their specialized housing assignments, these inmates are "otherwise indistinguishable," she said, with the same routines.
She said Wyatt's claim that Cosby has a "trusty" guiding him around is misleading.
" 'Trusty' is not even a word we use. We don't have trusties; they're inmate assistants who help the disabled," Worden said.
"In his case, it's public knowledge he's visually impaired, so they would help guide him around," she said. "From what I understand from prison staff, he is going to the dining room," she said.
Cosby, 81, was convicted last April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
A jury found him guilty of giving former Temple University staffer Andrea Constand a mystery medication and sexually assaulting her while she was incapacitated at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004.
The comedian claimed the encounter was consensual, but the judge allowed several of the more than 60 women now accusing Cosby of sexual assault to testify as so-called prior bad act witnesses.
Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison at a hearing in September.

Texto completo: Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson on Thursday defended herself against allegations that she plagiarized portions of her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," but conceded that the book's language in some cases was "too close" to the sources she drew from.
In a statement to The Washington Post, Abramson said she strove to properly credit and give attribution to "the many hundreds of sources that were part of my research." She pointed to 70 pages of footnotes, but vowed to correct errors in attribution.
"The notes don't match up with the right pages in a few cases and this was unintentional and will be promptly corrected," she said. "The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text. This, too, will be fixed."
Abramson was confronted about the allegations - outlined in a Twitter thread by Vice News's Michael Moynihan - during an appearance Wednesday on Fox News. When asked by anchor Martha MacCallum whether she had any comment on numerous similarities detailed by Moynihan, Abramson replied, "I really don't."
Moynihan's tweets went viral Wednesday and brought considerable attention to Abramson's book, which was mired in controversy even before it published this month. The thread, which focuses on three chapters Abramson wrote on the media company Vice, highlights paragraphs containing language that appears to be lifted from material published in Time Out, the New Yorker and the Columbia Journalism Review.
"The book is over 500 pages," the author said in her statement to The Post. "All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine. The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't."
"I was up all night going through my book because I take these claims of plagiarism so seriously," Abramson said. "In writing Merchants of Truth, I tried above all to accurately and properly give attribution to the many hundreds of sources that were part of my research."
Moynihan wrote in the thread that there are "plenty more" examples of "enormous factual errors, other cribbed passages, single or unsourced claims."
When asked by MacCallum whether there could have been an attribution or footnote issue in the book, the former Times editor replied, "No, I don't think this is an issue at all."
"Many people from Vice have been taking issue with the book," she said. "I think they don't like the portrayal of Vice, although I think it's a very balanced portrait, and I have a lot of praise for some of their journalists and some of their stories. I like their fresh approach to news."
Ian Frisch, author of "Magic Is Dead" and a freelance journalist, said after reviewing Moynihan's thread that he did some digging of his own. He combed through what Abramson had written in her book about Vice's Thomas Morton, whom Frisch profiled in 2014 for a magazine he founded, Relapse.
He then posted a similar thread, highlighting what appear to be passages and quotes lifted without proper attribution. Although Relapse discontinued, Frisch said in an interview Wednesday night that his profile on Morton was accessible for a couple of years on his website before he took it down.
"The whole situation is quite troubling, especially from someone who looked up to Jill and people like her as sort of the institutional leaders," Frisch said. "I came up with and I still do read the New York Times every single day. To go through those passages and to see how similar they were to my own writing - for her to attribute a quote to Thomas as if he was speaking to her, when he was speaking to me - it's just very disheartening."
The Marshall Project's Bill Keller, who preceded Abramson in the role of executive editor at the New York Times, tweeted in support of her on Thursday. "It's distressing that some apparent carelessness in attribution might overshadow her achievement," he wrote.
Cary Goldstein, executive vice president of publicity at Simon & Schuster, which published "Merchants of Truth," said in a statement that it was "an exhaustively researched and meticulously sourced book."
"It has been published with an extraordinary degree of transparency toward its subjects; each of the four news organizations covered in the book was given ample time and opportunity to comment on the content, and where appropriate the author made changes and corrections," Goldstein said. "If upon further examination changes or attributions are deemed necessary we stand ready to work with the author in making those revisions."
The Washington Post reviewed end notes in Abramson's book, which refer to pages where she used material that was not her own. There is no indication in the main text of the book showing which passages require attribution.
The Post could not review all of the citations but found some citations that appear to refer to Frisch's work as well as examples pointed out by Moynihan. The citations are not referenced in the passages where the sourced material was used and instead are listed with page numbers and organized by chapter. They key to specific quotes or terms in the passages and refer to articles, websites and books.
"I've been shown that small snippets of my story have been credited in the endnotes, but the endnotes do not go into the depth of how much this section about Thomas relied on my article," Frisch later wrote on Twitter. "She quotes Thomas as if he's speaking to her directly. This would not fly for a mag article."
Speaking with The Post, he added, "I worked so hard to stick to the foundation of journalism, which is truth and accuracy, and it's difficult for me to see such brazen similarities in Jill's work and my own."
In the book's acknowledgments, Abramson credits a journalist named John Stillman as her "research, reporting, writing, and editing assistant."
"He made contributions from beginning to end that made this book possible," she writes, adding that "he drafted portions of this book and provided a sharp eye throughout in editing the manuscript."
The Post reached out to Stillman by phone and email but received no immediate response.
This is not the first time Abramson's work has come under scrutiny. Author Corey Robin noticed in February 2018 that a paragraph in her New York Magazine feature making a case for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas appeared to mimic portions of a 2016 article on the justice by Think Progress's Ian Millhiser.
The paragraph in Abramson's story was subsequently updated to include a link and attribution to the Think Progress article.

Can old-fashioned journalism combat fake news?

Resumen: News-rating start-up NewsGuard hopes to take a traditional approach against online misinformation, by using actual humans, not algorithms, to create 'nutrition labels' for news outlets and other websites.

Texto completo: Google “What is fracking?” and one of the top results will be what-is-fracking.com, a cleanly designed website that explains that extracting natural gas through hydraulic fracturing does not contaminate drinking water, does not pollute the air to a significant degree, and helps raise wages in local communities.
What the site doesn’t explain is who published it. The only hint is a copyright notice, in 10.5-point font at the bottom of each page, linking to “api.org.”
“I don't care what you think of fracking,” says journalist, lawyer, and entrepreneur Steven Brill. But, he says,“you should know that this website, which reads like The Economist, is owned and operated and published by the American Petroleum Institute.”
Whether created by spammers, grifters, conspiracy theorists, or propagandists, sites that conceal or play down their ownership and financing, blend news with advertising, and routinely publish misinformation are widespread on the internet. And it’s not always easy to distinguish these sites from the ones operated by those acting in good faith.
“There are so many sites now that it’s hard to know which ones are credible and aren’t credible,” says Lisa Fazio, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who studies how people process information. “It takes a lot of effort and cognitive brainpower to really think through our prior knowledge on a topic, so we tend not to do that.”
Fake news is, of course, nothing new, nor is the feeling that misinformation is prevailing. Outright lies and misleading narratives masquerading as facts have persisted since the early days of the printing press. But the ease of publication in the Digital Age has made it all the more difficult for readers to sort reported, objective journalism from the chaff of hoaxers and propagandists.
Recent years have seen attempts to draw political maps of the media landscape, but efforts to alert readers to bias are susceptible to internal biases as well. For instance, AllSides, a news aggregator that presents news from across the political spectrum, labels MSNBC, the television network that in 2003 canceled Phil Donahue’s show for being too liberal, as being on the far left. It places Newsmax, a conservative news site that in 2009 laid out how a military coup could be the “last resort to resolve the ‘Obama problem,’ ” in an equivalent position on the right.
Other efforts to map media bias fail to capture the political stances of the publications they rate. For instance, the popular “Media Bias Chart” created by Ad Fontes Media places the liberal-leaning online news magazine Slate to the left of the unabashedly progressive TV and radio program Democracy Now!, a rating that is laughable to anyone familiar with both news outlets.
Ordinary people are, on average, good at identifying media bias, says Gordon Pennycook, a psychologist at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. His research, published last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that non-experts across the political spectrum tended to rate mainstream news outlets more trustworthy than low-quality or hyperpartisan sources.
“But,” he says, “they aren't so good at determining the quality of mainstream sources.”
Other efforts to rate the credibility of news outlets rely on machine learning. In 2016, Google gave more than $170,000 to three British firms to develop automated fact-checking software.
An old-school approach To help people distinguish the genuine from the ersatz, Mr. Brill and former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz created NewsGuard, a company that has so far produced “nutrition labels” for 2,200 sites, which Brill says account for more than 96 percent of the online news content that Americans see and share. In January Microsoft’s Edge browser included NewsGuard’s technology on mobile browser (Edge users can turn it on in Settings). Desktop users running Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers can install NewsGuard as a plugin.
NewsGuard’s methodology is a decidedly old-school approach to a new problem. Instead of using algorithms or other machine-learning tools, NewsGuard has paid dozens of journalists to dig into each site and to contact news organizations for comment. The nutrition labels, which detail each site’s ownership, history, advertising policies, and editorial stance, can run more than a thousand words.
“When we started talking to tech companies about it, they were horrified at how inefficient it is,” says Brill. “It's actually highly efficient and is the only way to achieve scale.”
Users with the NewsGuard extension will see a badge appearing on their browser toolbar and next to some hyperlinks – a green one with a checkmark for sites rated as credible, a red one with an exclamation point for those rated as not, and a yellow Thalia mask for satire sites like The Onion and ClickHole. Click on a badge, and you’ll see how NewsGuard rates the site according to nine criteria, including objective measures like whether it clearly labels advertising or provides biographies or contact information for the writers, as well as more subjective ones like “gathers and presents information responsibly.”
NewsGuard awards full marks to mainstream news sites like The New York Times, CNN, and The Washington Post. (The Christian Science Monitor also gets top grades.) Far-right sites like Breitbart and InfoWars get failing grades. Not surprisingly, what-is-fracking.com also gets a red badge.
Human-powered, with human biases NewsGuard’s rating system occasionally produces results that have raised eyebrows. Al Jazeera, the Qatari state-funded news outlet credited with helping to spread the 2010-11 Arab Spring protests, gets a failing grade for not disclosing its ownership and for painting Qatar in a favorable light. Boing Boing, a 30-year-old webzine generally held in high regard by tech journalists, is also tagged as unreliable for blurring the lines between news, opinion, and advertising, claims that Boing Boing’s editors have disputed.
Because it’s powered by human beings, NewsGuard can fall prey to the same human biases that afflict news organizations. For instance, NewsGuard’s label for The New York Times includes a discussion of the 2003 Jayson Blair scandal and the discredited reporting in 1931 by Stalin apologist Walter Duranty, but it contains no mention of the paper’s reporting before the US-led invasion of Iraq, in which the Times, by its own admission, was insufficiently critical in accepting official claims about weapons of mass destruction.
When asked why no mention of the pre-invasion reporting was on the label, Brill said, “It should be there; it will end up there.”
Adam Johnson, an analyst for the nonprofit media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, says that NewsGuard fails to account for how mainstream news outlets can manufacture false narratives.  
“If any other country used a fake-news plugin to flag false information,” he continues, “we would call it what it is: censorship.”
Brill acknowledges that NewsGuard’s isn’t a panacea. “We are not solving all the problems of the world,” he says. “If we existed in the run-up to the Iraq war, you would not have seen a red mark” on the Times’s reporting on WMDs.
But, he says, his company offers an improvement over how social networks like Facebook and news aggregators like Google News determine which news sites are credible. Those companies keep their process secret, they say, so that people won’t be able to game their system.
“We love it when people game our system,” says Brill. “We now have 466 examples of websites that have changed something about what they do in order to get a higher score.”
“To me [NewsGuard] sounds very sensible,” says Professor Pennycook. But, he says, “the people who are going to go out of their way to install this thing, they’re not the people we’re worrying about.”
NewsGuard’s labels may represent a less heavy-handed way of dealing with misinformation than what some Silicon Valley companies have proposed. In 2017, for instance, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, said that it should be possible for Google’s algorithms to detect misinformation and delist or de-prioritize it on search-engine results pages, an approach that Mr. Johnson calls “creepy and dystopian.”
“I don’t really believe in de-prioritizing,” says Brill, who says he would be uncomfortable licensing his technology to companies that would hide sites flagged as unreliable. “Our view is that people ought to have the chance to see everything.”
Still, NewsGuard’s ranking system, if widely adopted, would likely influence whether people choose to read or share certain stories. In a Gallup poll commissioned by NewsGuard, more than 60 percent of respondents said they were less likely to share stories from sites that were labeled as unreliable.
It’s this binary approach to news that rankles Johnson. “People aren’t children,” he says. “They should be able to navigate information online without a US corporate, billionaire-funded report card telling them what’s real or not.”
Robert Matney, the director of communications for New Knowledge, an Austin-based cybersecurity company that the US Senate commissioned to investigate Russia’s efforts to influence US politics, notes that the strength of companies like NewsGuard lies not necessarily in their ratings, but in the way they educate the public.
“Encouraging news/media literacy by enabling consumers to learn more about sources is a valuable service,” he writes via email.

NYPD demands Google remove police reporting feature from Waze over DUI checkpoint concerns

Texto completo: The New York Police Department has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding its navigation app Waze remove a feature that allows users to report police locations.
The department is concerned Waze is enabling users to circumvent Driving While Impaired (DWI) laws, it wrote in a letter sent to Google over the weekend, according to The New York Times and Streetsblog NYC. While Waze does not have a DWI reporting feature, when users report the locations of police, they can leave notes as to what the officers are doing in the area.
The department is demanding Google "immediately remove this function from the Waze application" upon receiving the letter, wrote Ann Prunty, the NYPD's acting deputy commissioner for legal matters.
"Individuals who post the locations of DWI checkpoints may be engaging in criminal conduct since such actions could be intentional attempts to prevent and/or impair the administration of the DWI laws and other relevant criminal and traffic laws," Prunt wrote. "The posting of such information for public consumption is irresponsible since it only serves to aid impaired and intoxicated drivers to evade checkpoints and encourage reckless driving. "
Google, however, does not see eye-to-eye on the issues raised by NYPD on the reporting feature.
"Safety is a top priority when developing navigation features at Google," a company spokesperson told The Verge in a statement. "We believe that informing drivers about upcoming speed traps allows them to be more careful and make safer decisions when they’re on the road. "

Madonna will be awarded GLAAD's Advocate for Change Award at the 30th GLAAD Media Awards in May.
The pop music icon will be honored by the advocacy group in New York for her lifetime of accelerating LGBTQ acceptance, GLAAD announced Tuesday. Madonna is the second person and first woman to receive the honor, which is awarded to "a person who, through their work, changed the game for LGBTQ people around the world." President Clinton was given the Advocate for Change Award in 2013 for work to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act.
Madonna has supported the LGBTQ community since the early days of her career, which coincided with the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s. The organization cited her performances at AIDS benefit concerts, creating a benefit dance marathon and demanding action when the epidemic went unrecognized by media.
This year is the 30th anniversary of her 1989 album, "Like a Prayer," and GLAAD noted that the album included a leaflet titled "The Facts about AIDS."
In a banner year for LGBTQ representation onscreen, 20 films and 30 television shows (plus five individual TV episodes and five TV movies or limited series) are up for honors at this year's GLAAD Media Awards. For the first time, the organization has expanded the category honoring films with a limited theatrical release from five to 10 nominees.
Nominees include "Love Simon," "Crazy Rich Asians," "The Favourite," "Pose," "Schitt's Creek," "The Handmaid's Tale," "Nanette," Janelle Monae, Don Lemon, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Univision, MSNBC, Ebony, GQ, CNN and the New York Times.

Hey, isn't that  Chris Evans, aka Captain America, making the rounds of Democratic Senate offices on Tuesday afternoon?
The actor posed for pics with Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and looked to be having a good time, per the social media evidence: Markey posted a photo of himself and Boston-native Evans holding a note congratulating the New England Patriots on their Super Bowl win.
But it seems Evans' mission was serious, too. Coons tweeted a photo of himself with the actor saying, "Here's me explaining to @ChrisEvans aka @CaptainAmerica that vibranium is a metallic alloy with defined stoichiometry," he wrote. "We also talked about the good work he's doing to get young Americans more engaged in civics, which is important, too."
The Hill visitor wouldn't say what brought him to the Capitol. "I can't dive into it," he told National Journal reporter Zach Cohen.

Texto completo: A New York Times editor took to Twitter after the outlet faced criticism for using the phrase “dark makeup” instead of “blackface” in a headline about Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring’s confession he dressed up as a rapper in 1980.

"Today we published an article about an episode of racist behavior by Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring," Patrick Healy, the Times’ politics editor wrote. "In doing so, our initial story, headline, tweet and alert used a phrase that wasn't appropriate."

The Times’ initial coverage was based on Herring’s statement that he wore “brown makeup” in college when dressing up as a rapper for a party, Healy said. “We relied on Herring's quote to inform our initial language; we used the phrase dark makeup in our story.”

After facing criticism for side-stepping the word, however, the Times’ Twitter profile quickly took down a tweet featuring the original headline, replaced it with a a link to the updated story, and added a disclaimer.

“The coverage should have said blackface,” Healy said, and the change was made once that realization occurred. “It was never my intent to hide the change we were making. This was a breaking news story, and the headlines and text in breaking news stories are often revised and updated.”

The story was also updated “because blackface was the best word to convey the behavior and carried the appropriate connotations,” Healy said.

The Times’ gaffe comes a week after it published a review of the movie “Mary Poppins Returns” that criticized the Oscar-nominated film in its headline “Shameful Flirting With Blackface."

CENTCOM PRESSED ON YEMEN BOMBINGS

Texto completo: During a U.S. Senate hearing on Central Commands military operations, Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed its top leader for details about American support for the controversial Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.

Air Force tanker jets and crews  some from MacDill Air Force Base  have taken part in those missions by refueling Saudi coalition aerial attacks against Houthi rebels.

Warren was questioning Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who leads CentCom from its MacDill headquarters.

But the question that CentCom and Air Force officials at MacDill and in Qatar say they cannot answer is how many aircraft or airmen from the Tampa base have taken part in the Saudi campaign in Yemen  a campaign whose civilian casualties have brought international appropriation to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners.

Since 2016, the Tampa Bay Times has repeatedly asked officials from CentCom, the 6th Air Mobility Wing at MacDill and U.S. Air Forces Central Command, which oversees CentComs air operations, about what role the Tampa refueling wings have played in the bombing campaign.

Officials have repeatedly answered that they do not track that level of detail.

Warren did not specifically address MacDills role in Tuesdays hearing. But she did ask questions about the overall U.S. role in the ongoing bombing campaign.

The New York Times reported that personnel assigned to the coalitions headquarters in Saudi Arabia readily had access to a database that detailed every airstrike or target, and a brief description of the attack, said Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate.

Then she asked Votel: So does this database exist?

Today, we do have a database that does have that information, Votel said. We have the ability to see that. Air Force refueling missions were scrubbed by the Pentagon in November at the request of the Saudis in the wake of humanitarian concerns about civilian casualties. But the U.S. still provides limited intelligence and sells weapons and munitions to coalition nations.

More than 6,600 civilians have been killed and more than 10,000 wounded since the start of the Saudi campaign in Yemen in 2015, according to a recent U.N. report, which suggests the campaign may be violating the rules of war and thus resulting in higher casualties than have been reported.

The report, conducted by the U.N.s Group of Regional and International Eminent Experts on Yemen, strongly suggests that parties to the armed conflict have perpetrated, and continue to perpetrate, violations and crimes under international law, according to a statement released in August.

A coalition of Sunni nations including the United Arab Emirates and others have been fighting to support Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015. But during that campaign, Saudi-led airstrikes on residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings and other civilian concentrations have sparked global outrage and increased pressure on the Pentagon to reduce  and even curtail  support for the Saudi-led campaign.

MacDill has several links to that conflict because it contains several headquarters, including CentCom and Special Operations Command Central, which oversees commando operations in the region. It is also home to the crews and aircraft of the 6th Air Mobility Wing and the 927th Air Refueling Wing. Both are deployed to the Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar to take part in missions in the CentCom region, which includes the Yemen conflict.

They are also intermingled with other wings from across the Air Force, so tracking how often MacDill crews have taken part in the Saudi effort is difficult. In addition, the United States is conducting a separate counterterrorism campaign against al-Qaida and an element of the Islamic State in Yemen.

Warrens questions Tuesday followed her letter sent the day before to Votel asking for details about the level of Air Force participation in the coalition attacks in Yemen. Warren asked Votel to tell her, among other things, whether CentCom logged tail numbers of the Air Force tankers and whether each country was invoiced correctly.

Votel said he would provide a response to those questions.

Last month, the Pentagons Inspector General began an audit to examine how the Pentagon is repaid by partner nations for refueling efforts. That audit will include a visit to CentCom headquarters at MacDill. It comes after the Pentagon announced in December that because of accounting errors, it failed to bill Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates $331 million between April 2015 to Nov. 11, 2018, for fuel and refueling services.

Votel was also asked by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., about the status of that repayment.

They have given us every indication that they will meet the requirements for reimbursement we have asked for, the general said.

In his opening statement, Votel said he still supports American support of the Saudi effort.

Certainly it is a very significant humanitarian disaster in Yemen, the general said. But I do believe departing from our partners there removes the leverage that we have to continue to influence them, which I think we have used in a positive manner, and I think it further endangers Americans in the region.

Even though those refueling missions have stopped, a Florida Congressman is among those who recently re-introduced legislation to make sure they do not re-start.

The war in Yemen has ravaged that country, U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Gainesville, said in a statement. This bill will change the dynamic of that war to help minimize civilian casualties.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — As the NBA's trade deadline is now just over a day away, one member of the Utah Jazz whose name hasn't been mentioned much (if at all) as being available given his rising stardom is Donovan Mitchell.
But at least one team has reportedly inquired about him.
On Tuesday, New York Times reporter Marc Stein wrote a story about how the New York Knicks' trade of Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks came together last week. In it, Stein mentioned that in seeking a deal for Porzingis, the Knicks asked the Jazz if they were interested in trading for the 7-foot-3 Latvian.
"They tried for untouchables such as Utah’s Donovan Mitchell and Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox and, predictably, were rebuffed," Stein wrote.
Kyle Van Noy is New England Patriots' 'biggest steal' in Bill Belichick era
Former BYU linebacker Kyle Van Noy won his second Super Bowl on Sunday as a member of the New England Patriots, and on Tuesday, Doug Kyed of NESN in Boston wrote a column arguing that Van Noy is the Patriots' biggest steal during head coach Bill Belichick's tenure.
Kyed focused on how productive Van Noy was not only on Sunday, but how good he's been since getting traded to the Patriots by the Detroit Lions in 2016.
"If it’s not the best trade, it was certainly the biggest steal," Kyed wrote.

Last week, Twitter went crazy after Vivint, a sponsor of the Jazz, released three hilarious commercials featuring players on the roster (if you still haven't seen them, go here, here and here).
On Tuesday, an outtakes video was posted on Twitter of the "Cat Guy" commercial (the first one listed above).

Egypt Unveils Dozens Of Mummy Discoveries

Texto completo: Dozens of newly discovered mummies from the Ptolemaic era were unveiled at an Egyptian burial site this weekend, one of a number of sites the country plans to disclose this year, according to Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities.
The site, which was described as a family burial chamber, was discovered a year ago hollowed out of rock at Tuna el-Gebel, an ancient burial ground not far from the city of Minya in central Egypt. The area is known for its archaeological finds, including the tomb of Petosiris, an ancient Egyptian priest, and a catacomb filled with mummified falcons, ibises and baboons.
Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities posted information about the site on Facebook and Twitter, and invited foreign dignitaries and journalists to tour the tomb on Saturday.
The tomb consisted of numerous chambers that dated from 323 B.C. to 30 B.C. and that were accessible through a corridor and sloping set of stairs. Khaled El-Enany, the minister of antiquities, said in the presentation that the tomb belonged to a family, most likely from the elite middle class, and contained the bodies of more than 40 men, women and children.
Some of the adult mummies still had painted fragments of cartonnage at the base of their feet which were used for decoration and, in the Ptolemaic era, were made of old papyrus scrolls. Some of the children were wrapped in linen decorated with ancient Egyptian script.
The ministry also displayed bowls and other items and found family artifacts from the Roman and Byzantine eras.
The site was excavated by the ministry and archaeologists from nearby Minya University. Wagdi Ramadan, who the ministry said headed the mission, said Saturday that some of the sarcophagi were tucked into niches in one large chamber, a burial style common at Tuna el-Gebel. Bodies were encased in wooden or stone sarcophagi, while others were tucked in sand or laid on the floor, wrapped in linen.
The tomb was first discovered in February 2018 and, according to Dr. El-Enany, the first announced discovery this year. He said he expected to announce more finds in the coming months.
Egypt's cultural and political underpinnings have long been associated with its archaeological past.
"Egypt always announces when it has a big find," said Sharon Waxman, the author of "Loot: The Battle Over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World." "Ancient Egypt is an integral part of modern Egypt's identity." (Ms. Waxman is a former reporter for The New York Times.)
One reason is that archaeological treasures drive tourism, a major industry that keeps Egypt's economy afloat. After the Arab Spring revolution swept across parts of the Middle East in 2011, Americans stayed away and have only begun to tiptoe back into the country.
In a report published by the World Tourism Organization last summer, Egypt led tourism growth in the Middle East in 2017, with many tourists coming from Western and Central Europe. If tourists stay away, the economy suffers.
"Tourism, in part, is what fuels the country," Ms. Waxman said. "The big problem in Egypt is that they have such a massive amount of antiquities, they are hard to maintain."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Lawmakers heard hours of passionate testimony on Monday about a proposal that would require teachers to get permission from parents or students before utilizing potentially "obscene material" in classrooms.
AUGUSTA — Lawmakers heard hours of passionate testimony on Monday about obscenity, literature and censorship as they considered a proposal to require teachers to notify parents or students before utilizing sexually explicit materials in classrooms.
Bill sponsor Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata, R-New Gloucester, and her supporters said parents as well as students should have the opportunity to opt out of reading or viewing “obscene materials.” Yet opponents pointed out that parents can already formally challenge a book’s usage with the local school board and compared Arata’s bill to previous attempts to ban works now considered classics of literature.
“Who is going to decide what is obscene? Who is going to police this law in all of our schools across this state?” asked Cathy Potter, a librarian in Falmouth’s public schools. “And are you prepared to prosecute librarians and teachers for putting books in the hands of our students ... because this would make it a crime.”
As an example of “the pornographic nature of materials being assigned to students in Maine,” Arata distributed excerpts from “Kafka on the Shore,” which was assigned to her son in the 12th grade. The 2002 book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami has won critical acclaim — including landing on The New York Times’ Top 10 list for 2005 — but contains some explicit descriptions of sexual activity as well as rape.
As originally written, Arata’s bill proposed that public schools be removed from the list of institutions — such as libraries or museums — that are exempt from the law prohibiting the dissemination of obscene materials to minors. That proposal garnered vociferous push back from educators and others who recalled the moral policing that once led schools or entire states to ban such literary classics as “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Of Mice and Men” and “Catcher in the Rye.”
In response, Arata amended her bill to, instead, require teachers to provide written notice that the book or other materials contained obscene content or depictions of sexual assault. Both the students and their parents/legal guardians would need to provide written consent prior to receiving the materials.
“This common-sense bipartisan bill will give minors and parents the respect and dignity of choosing what is appropriate for them and their family so that they do not have to feel embarrassed, harassed or traumatized,” Arata said. She said the bill “will help make sure that all Maine schools are safe and nurturing environments for our children.”
Supporters included the Christian Civic League of Maine, pastors and parents, as well as several survivors of sexual assault warned that graphic depictions or descriptions could further traumatize children who are victims themselves. Others objected to teachers’ selection of certain movies with objectionable material in their classroom curriculum.
Jennifer White of Gray said her then 11-year-old daughter was confused after watching a film in class that included both sexual content and depictions of a man committing suicide with a gun.
“Showing a movie with that type of graphic content and sexually explicit material can cause harm to a child that is not mature enough to handle it, and fifth grade is not mature enough to handle that,” White said. “This is one example of how L.D. 94 can better provide transparency to both children and families.”
But teachers, librarians and associations representing Maine’s school boards and superintendents urged lawmakers to reject a bill that would make it a criminal offense for teachers to teach literary texts that some perceive as obscene.
“The problem is that what is obscene to one person or group may be judged to have artistic or social merit to another,” said Claudette Brassil, a retired English teacher representing the Maine Council for English Language Arts. “Criminalization of literary choices is a detriment to academic freedom. As in the past, contemporary community standards continue to evolve and are influenced by many forces.”
Brassil, a Brunswick resident who taught at Mt. Ararat High School in Topsham, testified that literary works can sometimes provide a platform for students to talk about violence or sexual situations with adults. She also said that she believes children are becoming more willing to speak up to trusted individuals — including teachers — when they are victims of abuse.
Opponents also said the bill was unnecessary because school boards in Maine already have a process through which members of the public can challenge the suitability of educational materials and request a formal review. In fact, Arata used that process to successfully challenge the use of “Kafka on the Shore” in her children’s schools.
“This is a decision that I believe is best handled locally with your school board — people who you elect and most likely represent, as a group, the norms in your community,” said Victoria Wallack, representing both the Maine School Boards Association and the Maine Schools Superintendents Association. “That is where I would go first. I wouldn’t be here at the Legislature trying to change educational policy that is rightfully adopted ... by the school board.”
The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee is expected to hold a work session on L.D. 94 next Monday.

Texto completo: The Trump administration has been criticized for dropping the federal government's appeal of a 2016 case MetLife won to shed its designation as a "systemically important financial institution," or SIFI. Former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen told the Brookings Institution she "strongly opposed" the administration's decision, since the court's ruling "set standards that would make future designations all but impossible."
In truth, it was the government's refusal to follow any standards that caused Judge Rosemary Collyer to find the designation of MetLife as a SIFI "arbitrary and capricious."
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which can deem a firm systemically important if "material financial distress" would "pose a threat to the financial stability" of the U.S. By law, SIFIs must hold higher levels of capital than their peers for the same levels of risk. That added burden can pressure successful companies to restructure or break up, which can raise prices for customers as efficient firms are driven from the market.
MetLife engaged in a 15-month dialogue with FSOC to avoid a SIFI designation, but the agency's decision was a foregone conclusion.
The Basel, Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board designated MetLife as systemically important more than a year before FSOC did it in 2014. U.S. regulators didn't merely follow that body's lead -- they participated in its decision. We believe FSOC officials supported the international board's labeling MetLife systemically important and that the U.S. proceedings were merely a formality to implement the decision made in Basel.
At MetLife's presentation to FSOC deputies, we described research showing that the company's liabilities subject to a "run on the bank" were nowhere near large enough to destabilize the financial system. One regulator found the research intriguing and asked for a copy, but we had provided that to the FSOC five months earlier. Avoiding the SIFI designation was an existential issue for MetLife, but these officials hadn't even bothered to read our briefs.
On other occasions, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he would rather overregulate than underregulate -- excesses could be fixed later. But by then firms designated as SIFIs could be permanently harmed. We sued to avoid that fate and preserve MetLife's ability to compete.
As the court recognized, the decision that emerged from FSOC's process was "fatally flawed." The agency is supposed to assess companies' vulnerability to distress. That's because strong and stable firms are less likely to experience severe distress that threatens the financial system. But in MetLife's case, the FSOC ignored its own rules and simply assumed MetLife would enter "material financial distress," with no consideration of the likelihood. This imaginary crisis wouldn't be any old distress -- the FSOC hypothesized a crisis without precedent in the history of U.S. insurance. Their modelers further assumed that to meet its liabilities MetLife would sell assets randomly, taking avoidable losses for no reason.
The FSOC didn't stop there. Its projections assumed that state regulators responsible for overseeing MetLife would either stand idle or cause industrywide panic if they did intervene. The agency's independent insurance expert dissented from the agency's decision because it relied on "implausible, contrived scenarios."
MetLife uses collateral-backed derivatives to hedge key risks. But the FSOC essentially gave us no credit for these hedges and ignored our counterparties' collateral. When we objected, the agency pivoted and said the collateral could cause instability. Somehow the FSOC construed a risk mitigant as a new source of risk.
In her recent remarks, Ms. Yellen claimed the court's decision in favor of MetLife compels the FSOC to conduct a "full-blown cost-benefit analysis" for SIFI designations. That's false. What Judge Collyer held, citing Supreme Court precedent, is that "'no regulation is 'appropriate' if it 'does significantly more harm than good.'" She concluded: "Because FSOC refused to consider cost as part of its calculus, it is impossible to know whether its designation 'does significantly more harm than good.'"
MetLife adhered to the Dodd-Frank Act; its lawsuit did not "attack" the law, as the New York Times then editorialized. Dodd-Frank allows nonbank financial companies to contest SIFI designations. The statute's purpose is to "protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts," and we share that goal. MetLife has always stood on its own feet. It remained profitable throughout the financial crisis and emerged strong enough to buy part of AIG's life-insurance operations for $16.4 billion -- money AIG used to repay taxpayers.
Ms. Yellen is right that MetLife's court victory set new standards for SIFI designations. They are standards that undergird all American jurisprudence: due process, evidence-based decision making, and the rule of law.

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. -- Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Virginia emphatically denied on Monday a woman's claim that he sexually assaulted her in 2004, suggesting at one point that Gov. Ralph Northam's supporters were trying to block his ascent to the governorship at a moment when Mr. Northam is besieged by demands that he resign over charges of racism.
"Does anybody think it's any coincidence that on the eve of potentially my being elevated that that's when this smear comes out?" Mr. Fairfax told reporters surrounding him in the rotunda of the state Capitol about whether he believes Mr. Northam, a fellow Democrat, was behind the accusation's coming to light.
He softened his suggestion as he left the Capitol Monday night, telling reporters he had "no indication" that Mr. Northam was responsible.
But in the same conversation, Mr. Fairfax hinted that Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond and a potential rival to Mr. Fairfax for the 2021 Democratic nomination for governor, may have played a role -- praising the acumen of a reporter who inquired whether Mr. Stoney might have been responsible.
Asked if he had any involvement in leaking the claims of assault, which first surfaced Sunday night on a right-wing website, Mr. Stoney said, "The insinuation is 100 percent not true, and frankly it's offensive."
Just hours after The Washington Post published a story on Monday outlining the woman's allegation -- that Mr. Fairfax assaulted her soon after they had met in Boston at the Democratic National Convention -- the lieutenant governor said that he and the woman had had what he called "a 100 percent consensual" sexual encounter.
"We hit it off, she was very interested in me, and so eventually, at one point, we ended up going to my hotel room," Mr. Fairfax said, recounting in a measured voice what he said had happened in 2004.
Mr. Fairfax asserted that the woman had subsequently called him and said she wanted him to meet her mother. He said he had no documentary evidence of any further conversations after their sexual encounter in 2004, when he was working as the personal aide to John Edwards, then a senator from North Carolina and the Democratic vice-presidential candidate that year.
Asked if he had seen her since the time in his hotel room, he said, "I don't believe so."
The New York Times has reached out to intermediaries for the woman who made the allegation, but they did not immediately comment on Monday.
An adviser to Mr. Northam, asked Monday if the embattled governor had been behind the revelation of the assault allegations, denied any responsibility and said the Northam camp did not have the capacity to plot such a move at a moment when Mr. Northam is struggling to retain his job.
The accusations against Mr. Fairfax threw Virginia's government into a deeper state of chaos three days after an image surfaced from Mr. Northam's medical school yearbook page showing a man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. The governor, after initially acknowledging he was one of the men in the 1984 photo, is now denying that he was and refusing insistent calls from state and national Democrats that he resign.
Even though Mr. Northam admitted Saturday at his own news conference to once darkening his face with shoe polish for a Michael Jackson costume at a dance party, his advisers said Monday that he would not step down, and his chief of staff told other aides at a staff meeting that they owed it to Mr. Northam to remain with him for now, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversation.
For his part, Mr. Fairfax noted that he was in "a unique position" and wanted to remain "circumspect" about whether he thought the governor should quit.
But he was less restrained in claiming that there was a "manipulation" effort to derail his career in elective politics, which began with his election as lieutenant governor in 2017.
"It's such a shame that this has been weaponized and used as a smear, because this is a very real issue," he said of sexual assault.
Mr. Fairfax ran separately from Mr. Northam during the Democratic primaries for lieutenant governor and governor; unlike candidates in some other states, Mr. Northam did not choose Mr. Fairfax as his running mate.
After Mr. Fairfax spoke to the news media for just over 10 minutes, the clerk of the State Senate, Susan Clarke Schaar, strode through a pack of reporters and photographers and told the lieutenant governor he needed to return to his post presiding over the chamber.
Monday's spectacle beside the Houdon-designed George Washington statue in the Capitol was extraordinary: Mr. Fairfax, a 39-year-old African-American, rebutting claims of sexual misconduct and suggesting the accusations were part of an effort by allies of Mr. Northam's to salvage a governorship that is listing due to the racism that still scars Virginia.
The fast-moving events began at 2:55 a.m. Monday, when aides to Mr. Fairfax -- a Democrat widely seen as a rising star in the party -- put out a statement saying the allegation was "false" and that Mr. Fairfax had "never assaulted anyone -- ever -- in any way, shape or form." The aides said that Mr. Fairfax was considering "appropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation."
The Post story Monday said the woman contacted the newspaper after Mr. Fairfax won election in November 2017 and alleged that he had sexually assaulted her in 2004.
The Post was unable to corroborate her allegations, which Mr. Fairfax had denied, according to Monday's story. The Post, however, disputed the Fairfax statement's assertion that the newspaper had found inconsistencies and red flags in the woman's allegation.
Fairfax aides issued a second statement on Monday afternoon, this time accusing The Post of having "smeared" Mr. Fairfax by publishing its Monday story detailing the allegations without corroboration. The Post's executive editor, Martin Baron, replied that Mr. Fairfax had gone first in "issuing a statement regarding allegations against him, making specific representations about Post reporting," and that the paper had an obligation to clarify the nature of allegations and its reporting.
As Mr. Northam held meetings Monday, first with his cabinet and then with his staff in the state Capitol complex, stunned legislators arrived to word of the middle-of-the-night statement by the Fairfax aides after the publication of the story by a site calledBig League Politics.
After Mr. Fairfax, the second in line to become governor is the state attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat who had already indicated plans to run for governor in 2021.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. - Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, facing pressure from his own party to resign, said Saturday he would not quit and denied that he had appeared in Ku Klux Klan robes or in blackface in images from his 1984 medical school yearbook that have upended his governorship.
"It was definitely not me," Mr. Northam, a Democrat, told reporters at a news conference in the governor's mansion. "I can tell by looking at it."
Mr. Northam read a prepared statement a day after he apologized for being in the photo. He said that after further reflection with his family and classmates, he has no recollection of the photo and believes he isn't either of the two men.
He said part of the reason he thinks that is, is that he vividly remembers another situation in which he blackened his face to portray Michael Jackson at a dance contest he won in San Antonio in 1984, after graduating from Eastern Virginia Medical School.
"You remember these things," he said.
The governor's denial wasn't enough for many, though, including members of his own administration and political party.
"It is no longer possible for Governor Northam to lead our Commonwealth and it is time for him to step down," said state Attorney General Mark Herring.
The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus on Saturday reiterated its call for Mr. Northam to resign.
"Yesterday we met with the Governor, looked him in the eye and expressed our deep sense of betrayal, pain, and disappointment," the group said in a statement. "Changing his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust.
"Our confidence in his ability to govern for the over 8 million Virginians has been eviscerated."
The Washington Post reported that the caucus was also concerned about a nickname that can be interpreted as a racial slur -- "Coonman" -- listed underneath Mr. Northam's picture in his Virginia Military Institute yearbook. Mr. Northam graduated from Virginia Military Institute in 1981, receiving a bachelor's degree in biology.
When asked about the nickname during Saturday's press conference, Mr. Northam said a couple of men had called him that and he didn't know why.
Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who is the second African-American elected to a statewide office in Virginia, issued a statement Saturday acknowledging Mr. Northam's "service to children, soldiers and constituents" but said he "cannot condone the actions from his past that, at the very least, suggest a comfort with Virginia's darker history of white supremacy, racial stereotyping and intimidation." Mr. Fairfax, who would become governor should Mr. Northam quit, did not call for the governor's resignation.
"At this critical and defining moment in the history of Virginia and this nation, we need leaders with the ability to unite and help us rise to 'the better angels of our nature'," Mr. Fairfax said, borrowing a celebrated phrase from Abraham Lincoln.
L. Douglas Wilder, who was the first elected black governor of a U.S. state when he led Virginia from 1990 to 1994, didn't call for Mr. Northam to resign but said on Twitter: "It has never been right, in Virginia, nor anywhere else to participate in or condone such mockery or insensitive behavior and for that Gov. Northam should be criticized. This is not about politics or personal relationship, this is about government 'of the people, for the people and by the people' - ALL of the people," he said. "The choice of his continuing in office is his to make."
Mr. Northam faced pressure not only from Virginia Democrats but from some of the Democratic Party's presidential candidates and national leaders
Democrats in the Trump era have adopted a sort of zero-tolerance approach in their own ranks toward misconduct involving race and gender. With Republicans eager to level accusations of hypocrisy, Democratic leaders in Washington have sought to aggressively police the sort of misdeeds they have linked to President Donald Trump. They have pushed out lawmakers such as former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken and former Rep. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, both of whom were accused of sexual harassment.
With the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race getting underway, the pressure on Mr. Northam has been intense: The party's White House hopefuls were some of the first officials to call on him to resign Friday night, beginning a cascade of demands that extended through Saturday morning when other potential Democratic candidates, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urged the governor to step down.
By the time he strode to a podium in the governor's mansion, with portraits of Virginia's founding fathers behind each shoulder, Mr. Northam was increasingly isolated. In phone calls Saturday morning, he said he had no recollection of the yearbook images.
Mr. Northam started calling former classmates at Eastern Virginia Medical School in an effort to determine more information about the picture - and to survive a crisis that is threatening his year-old governorship, according to a Democrat familiar with Mr. Northam's calls. This Democrat said the governor was determined to prove it was not him in the photograph and was even considering using facial recognition software.
At his news conference Saturday, Mr. Northam said that he had had a chance to sit down Friday night and look at the photo closely. He said he had also consulted with his family and friends, including a classmate who said that there were photo mix-ups on other pages in the yearbook.
He said Saturday that he had not bought the yearbook and had never seen it.
By Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both weighing presidential runs, both said he should resign.
The New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

Texto completo: Almost as soon as you settle in to watch the 1939 melodrama "Lying Lips," you can figure out who is the victim, who is the villain and who is the hero. And even if you know how it all will end, you want to watch anyway.
That was the beauty of the filmmaker Oscar Micheaux. He made you want to soak up the exuberance he clearly felt in delivering a whole new way of telling stories.
The 40 or so films that Micheaux wrote, directed and produced from 1919 to 1948 carry with them the added excitement of black characters doing things that at the time seemed unthinkable onscreen. Women could be damsels in distress, intelligent enough to plot and scheme, and were able to recreate the feel of a black-and-tan show on black-and-white film. Men were rugged and sometimes flawed but rarely surrendered their masculinity for comedic effect.
The performances were rollicking good, and they concealed the fact that Micheaux was essentially an outsider artist as filmmaker, prefiguring today's independent black producer-directors like Spike Lee and Tyler Perry. He was a gifted visionary, with an eye for talent, evinced by decisions like casting the dazzling stage actor Paul Robeson in his first role on the big screen. His films depicted the basic humanity of black characters wrestling with issues like racial ambiguity, while at the same time countering the racist tropes in works like D. W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" (1915).
Micheaux's achievements were even more notable given his background.
Oscar Michaux was born on Jan. 2, 1884, to Calvin and Bell Michaux, both former slaves, in Metropolis, Ill., a town on the Ohio River. (He would later add the "e" to his surname.) He dropped out of high school and secured a job as a Pullman porter assisting railway passengers, a plum position for African-American men of his era. But he wanted more than a comfortable existence.
Micheaux was brimming with ambition; he wanted to heed Booker T. Washington's call for black economic independence by building his own wealth. So he became a homesteader, securing a plot in Gregory County, S.D., on which to plant the farm that he hoped would sustain himself and his future family. Long before he was a pioneering filmmaker, he was literally a pioneer.
Life on the farm went well at first. Micheaux had a few good harvests, and he eventually felt secure enough to marry. He was joined in 1910 by his new bride, Orlean McCracken, a sister, Olive, and a grandmother, Louisa Gough, a former slave. But things went sour. The financial strain of expanding his farmland coincided with marital tensions that erupted after his wife delivered a stillborn son. She retreated home to Chicago, and the marriage ended. Before they divorced, Orlean died in a horse-trampling accident, technically making Micheaux a widower.
He stanched the loneliness of the frontier by indulging a voracious literary appetite. He read classic works and new fiction, and also wrote to the black newspaper The Chicago Defender urging black people to take advantage of the land grab out West. Soon, he began more ambitious work. He set pen to paper, using his time in South Dakota as the jumping-off point of a thinly veiled memoir called "The Conquest" (1913). He wrote a legal drama called "The Forged Note" (1915) and returned to the frontier in a fictionalized memoir called "The Homesteader" (1917).
The memoirs detail the settlement of South Dakota towns by homesteaders and chronicles the life of the sole black settler, who becomes enamored of a white neighbor. In "The Homesteader," the protagonist realizes that his forbidden love appears to be white but -- spoiler alert! -- is in fact a fair-skinned black woman, allowing for a happy ending after a thorough examination of themes of racial allegiance and obligation.
The book was popular enough to gain notice from the black-owned Lincoln film studio, which sought to buy the movie rights. But Micheaux scraped together enough investment to produce the film himself. "The Homesteader" was released 100 years ago. It was "not exactly a Western, not merely a love story, but a fundamentally serious, truthful drama about one black man's troubles, addressing issues that were both singular to Micheaux and general to the race," a biographer, Patrick McGilligan, wrote in "Oscar Micheaux: The Great and Only." "The audience was electrified."
"The Homesteader" opened to rave reviews, but coverage of it -- and of Micheaux -- was largely relegated to media outlets that served the target audience of the film. Those reviews are all that remains of the movie; the actual film has been lost.
Micheaux released a slew of movies that mixed race, romance and action -- and were full of dramatic flourishes. "Within Our Gates" (1920) features a racist who repents when he realizes that the woman he is about to rape is his illegitimate black daughter, while "Body and Soul" (1925), the first Paul Robeson film, portrays a corrupt clergyman.
The films were also provocative. Black audiences were sometimes upset over the depiction of the black lower class. Whites did not like depictions of racist villainy. And censors feared the material could spark racial unrest.
Micheaux was undaunted. He opened offices in Chicago and Harlem, where he eventually settled. He remarried, to Alice Russell, who later appeared in some of his films. Her family home in Montclair, N.J., sometimes doubled as a film set.
His movies were shot on a shoestring budget and sometimes looked it. But his output as a filmmaker was groundbreaking.
"I really think he was one of the great filmmakers of the silent era," said Charles Musser, a professor at Yale who teaches film history. "Each of his films has a wealth of intertextual references that people of the time could have, should have, perhaps, may have, often probably didn't take them in and appreciate it, which gives his films another level of meaning and impact."
Micheaux made the transition from silent films to talkies, but not the transition from the rough-hewn production aesthetic of the early film days to the sleek productions that were beginning to define the movie industry. He faced stiff competition from Hollywood studios, which discovered that famous black entertainers could boost interest in otherwise white films.
Well-funded works like "Imitation of Life" (1934) borrowed heavily from the themes that Micheaux had mined for years, and others featured black actors as caricatures. By then, Micheaux's management of his production company -- run briefly with his brother Swan before they had a rift -- was a constant financial high-wire act that finally came crashing down.
In his twilight years, Micheaux turned his focus to publishing his own novels, some of them top sellers. He returned to film for one last hurrah in 1948 with "The Betrayal." It was the first film starring black actors to debut in a Broadway theater and was the only one reviewed by The Times. It was panned, and The Times was not alone in savaging it.
Micheaux died in Charlotte, N.C., on March 25, 1951, while on tour to promote some of his books.
"I have always tried to make my photoplays present the truth, to lay before the race a cross-section of its own life, to view the colored heart from close range," several sources quote him as saying in an open letter to black newspapers in 1924. "It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights."
He was eventually given recognition for doing so, with a Directors Guild special award in 1986, more than three decades after his death.

Texto completo: Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries, capturing the lives and legacies of people who have influenced the world in which we live.
But many important figures were left out.
Overlooked reveals the stories of some of those remarkable people.
We started the series last year by focusing on women like Sylvia Plath, the postwar poet; Emma Gatewood, the hiking grandmother who captivated a nation; and Ana Mendieta, the Cuban artist whose work was bold, raw and sometimes violent. We added to that collection each week.
Now, this special edition of Overlooked highlights a prominent group of black men and women whose lives we did not examine at the time of their deaths.
Many of them were a generation removed from slavery. They often attempted to break the same barriers again and again. Sometimes they made myth out of a painful history, misrepresenting their past to gain a better footing in their future. Some managed to achieve success in their lifetimes, only to die penniless, buried in unmarked graves. But all were pioneers, shaping our world and making paths for future generations.
We hope you'll spread the word about Overlooked -- and tell us who else we missed.
Read about the project's first year, and use this form to nominate a candidate for future Overlooked obits.

'Rent' and me, and all these years measured in love

Texto completo: During last Sunday night's broadcast of "Rent: Live" I found myself tweeting like a madman. Dozens of tweets. Cranky tweets, snarky tweets, tweets full of praise: "Brandon Victor Dixon is the real deal." Or complaint: "This all feels too canned." The commentary was launched from my fingertips - a ritual on these annual musical theater tele-gatherings - but even my most visceral reactions rose up from somewhere much deeper. ¶ Because "Rent" and I, we've been going together for 23 years. ¶ It's hard to express just how profoundly certain musicals are a part of me. And I know, from my wanderings on social media, that this particular inarticulateness does not dwell in my constitution alone. Musicals consoled me as a kid. I made the acquaintance of Stephen Sondheim on my record player in New Jersey, the one on which I wore out the grooves of the cast albums of "Company" and "Follies," and memorized the entire scores of shows as celebrated as "West Side Story" and little remembered as "Purlie."
So by the time I became a theater reporter at the New York Times, which was shortly before "Rent" debuted at the New York Theatre Workshop in 1996, my wiring had long since acquired all the required circuitry for another long-term commitment. And "Rent," with a passel of young, passionate performers and a score by Jonathan Larson that positively oozed heart, would prove to be one of those shows that penetrated mine.
This is all by way of explaining that even if musical lovers are entitled in no legal way to claim ownership, the shows we metabolize are ours. In my case, the bonding process was intensified by proximity. On "Rent's" way from East Fourth Street to Broadway in 1996, I was assigned to interview each of the 15 original cast members for a capsule profile of each. (Idina Menzel, the original Maureen, told me she was a rocker, not an actress, and Taye Diggs - the original Bennie, and whom Menzel would later marry - waxed poetic about his mother.)
Over the years, I was a witness to "Rent" growing up, as if I had a metaphysical ruler at the ready, always waiting to take the latest measure of the heights it had scaled. I was there, for instance, at the Nederlander Theatre on Broadway, to deliver the news that "Rent" had won the Pulitzer Prize. I attended both "Rent's" opening night at the Nederlander and, 12 years and 5,123 performances later, the night it ended its Broadway run.
My daughter Lizzie inherited the musical bug from me - or really, via the late Larson and the show's indelible stars, including Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Jesse L. Martin and Daphne Rubin-Vega. Some people, in fact, looked at me aghast at the time when I told them I'd taken my 10-year-old to "Rent," with its colorful language (excised on the three-hour Fox version) and frank portrayal of the ravages of AIDS.
I knew better. "Rent" had more humanity in one of its songs than most of the junk being marketed to kids her age revealed in their entirety. Lizzie and I would make attending "Rent" a father-daughter ritual, on any occasion it toured to Washington or she happened to be with me in New York. Our joint outings added to the tally of my "Rent" viewings, which at this point amount to 15. Yes, my name is Peter and I am a Rentaholic.
All of which brings me to my tweetstorm, a veritable involuntary display of devotion and pique. "Rent," based on Puccini's "La Boheme," has a challengingly slippery plot to begin with: Perhaps Larson would have refined the structure had he lived to see his show's official opening. Fox's telecast, before a shrieking audience, resolved none of the musical's shortcomings: Love means accepting the flaws in the object of one's affection. It even added a few. And it turned out not to be the live offering the network promised. An accident befalling the production's Roger, Brennin Hunt, during the previous evening's dress rehearsal led to a decision by Fox to air the tape of most of that rehearsal, with a shift to live theater only at the end.
The result, directed by "Rent's" original stage director, was a disappointingly bland - and seemingly canned - performance. The singing was by and large subpar. And some odd bits of editing were irritating. An AIDS patient's lyric: "Because reason says I should have died three years ago," was changed to "six months ago," for example. This sort of thing can drive a "Rent"-head to drink. Of course when I mentioned this abomination to my wife, her look of worry for me suggested that what I may have drunk was too much of the Kool-Aid.
In my defense, love can make you a little crazy. After all, Fox devoting three prime time hours to a Broadway musical, a week before the Super Bowl - and one containing the lyric "Sodomy, it's between God and me" - should be viewed as a modern wonder of the world. Even if the wonder contained too many commercial interruptions.
And who knows? The silver lining on an erratic evening may be that newly lovestruck kid in Bismarck or Little Rock or Spokane downloading the original cast album.

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The backlash was nearly instant.
Within hours of a photo surfacing on Friday that showed Virginia's Democratic governor in a photo showing two people dressed in blackface in Ku Klux Klan robes, a chorus calling for Ralph Northam to resign grew and spread across social media.
The photo was part of Northam's 1984 yearbook during his last year at Eastern Virginia Medical School. A half-page with four photos of Northam included one of two people, one in a blackface costume and the other wearing a KKK robe.
Northam admitted he was in the photo and apologized, but did not detail which of the pictured individuals he was dressed up as.
So, who is Ralph Northam? Here's what you should know:
Soft-spoken and moderate
Northam is widely viewed as a moderate within his party, someone who says he voted twice for former Republican President George W. Bush.
He has described himself as a fiscal conservative but socially liberal, as Northam has advocated for tighter gun laws and loosening abortion restrictions. Republicans in the state at one point tried to recruit Northam to switch parties, according to the New York Times, something Northam rejected.
A former doctor, Northam is soft-spoken and was relatively unknown outside of Virginia when he took up a bid for governor.
Northam entered politics in 2007 when he ran and won a bid to become a state senator. In 2013, he took up a bid for lieutenant governor, winning the post to become second in command for then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
His military, medical history
Before his political career, Northam served as a doctor in the U. S. Army and treated soldiers overseas during the Gulf War.
He served eight years in the military and traveled to Germany where he tended to soldiers during Operation Desert Storm.
He attended both Virginia Military Institute and Eastern Virginia Medical School and, after completing his residency, started treating children as a pediatric neurologist.
He continued that work while serving as lieutenant governor, spending his days both at the state capitol and treating children suffering from illnesses.
Response to Charlottesville
The deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville stunned the nation and thrust the small, southern city into the epicenter of a radical discussion about race and anti-Semitism.
After the 2017 rally, which left one woman dead and several injured after a neo-Nazi rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, politics became even divisive.
President Donald Trump cast blame on "both sides" and said "you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides," causing an uproar that took over the news cycle for days.
Northam, after the rally, denounced the "ugly" event and praised the city and its residents for promoting a place that values "openness, diversity and inclusion," according to the Washington Post.
"White supremacists have descended upon Charlottesville again to evoke a reaction as ugly and violent as their beliefs — just as they did before, I am urging Virginians to deny them the satisfaction," Northam said in a statement.

More: Calls for Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to resign flood in after blackface, KKK photo surfaces
An effort to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee led to the rally and violence.
Northam, at first, supported the removal of all Confederate statues in the aftermath of the event. He later changed his mind, saying it should be left up to local officials.
Racially charged governor's race
Northam ran for governor in 2017 in the aftermath of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, an event that shifted politics in the state.
The rally drew neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right, many of whom carried Confederate flags or wore clothing with Nazi or KKK insignias.
The November 2017 election was one of Virginia's most racially charged in recent memory and ended with Northam beating Republican Ed Gillespie.
Voters were peppered with ads about the Charlottesville unrest.
Many of Northam's attack ads focused on Gillespie's lobbying efforts but one mailer sought to compare Gillespie with the white nationalists who rallied in the city. The mailer, which included a photo of Gillespie and white nationalists, said the election was a chance to "stand up. . . to hate. "
Obama campaigned for him
During the 2017 campaign for governor, Northam was one of the candidates that former President Barack Obama supported.
During a rally in October 2017 rally, Obama, the first black president of the U. S. , campaigned for Northam and addressed the events of Charlottesville, saying one rises by not repeating the past.
"You know, Ralph believes that if we're going to talk about history hen we should do it in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds, not in a way that divides," Obama said. "We saw what happened in Charlottesville. But we also saw what happened after Charlottesville when the biggest gatherings of all rejected fear and rejected hate. "
The former president continued: "That's how we rise. We don't rise up by repeating the past. We rise up by learning from the past and by listening to each other and knowing that we're all flawed. But we still try to preserve some baseline measure of goodness and decency and patriotism and we look for the good in other people, not the worst. "

Deactivating Facebook leaves people less informed but happier, study finds

Texto completo: Around the world, more than 2.3 billion people are on Facebook, actively communicating and posting and consuming on the platform, a figure that continues to grow and drive record profits, despite a barrage of privacy scandals and heightened scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers. Masses of people are not abandoning Facebook, according to the company's fourth quarter earnings, released on Wednesday. In fact, the company has reversed a troubling trend in its most important market: Facebook added users in North America for the first time all year.
For Facebook fans, the benefits of using the platform are clear: it's a way to stay connected with friends, to consume news and entertainment, and, for businesses, to find potential customers and audiences. In recent years, however, researchers and consumer advocates have scrutinized what the downsides of all that growth and connectivity could mean for society and individual health and well-being.
In the latest study measuring the effects of social media on a person's life, researchers at New York University and Stanford University found that deactivating Facebook for just four weeks could alter people's behavior and state of mind. The study found that temporarily quitting Facebook led people to spend more time offline, watching TV and socializing with family and friends; reduced their knowledge of current events and polarization of policy views; and provoked a small but significant improvement in people's self-reported happiness and satisfaction with their lives.
What's more, the researchers found that the deactivation freed up an hour per day for the average person. And the people who took a break from Facebook continued to use the platform less often, even after the experiment ended.
"Our study offers the largest-scale experimental evidence available to date on the way Facebook affects a range of individual and social welfare measures, the researchers wrote. The researchers concluded the experiment shows the downsides of using Facebook, even as the same results "leave little doubt that Facebook produces large benefits for its users.
Participants said Facebook improves their lives in clear and diverse ways, the researchers found, from entertainment, to organizing philanthropy and activism, to providing social bonds for people who would otherwise feel isolated. "Any discussion of social media's downsides should not obscure the basic fact that it fulfills deep and widespread needs, the researchers said.
But the study found that the psychological improvements of abstaining from Facebook suggests that people may be using the social network more than they should. And while people are less informed about the news when they are away from Facebook, it also cooled partisan thinking.
In a statement to The Washington Post Thursday, Facebook said its teams are focused on fostering meaningful connections on the platform and have provided tools for users to better control their experience. "This is one study of many on this topic and it should be considered that way, the company said, repeating the study's own findings that users find clear benefits from the platform and that Facebook helps people stay informed.
The New York Times earlier reported on the study, which was posted on SSRN, an open access research portal.
The researchers did urge caution in interpreting their results, noting that people could have reacted differently if their break from Facebook or other social media was longer. That might have altered how users learned about the news and could have changed how they perceived their well-being. The types of people in the experiment also may have influenced the results, the researchers said.
The 2,844 Facebook users involved in the study, which took place in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections, was not a fully representative sample, the study conceded. Participants were "relatively young, well-educated, and left-leaning compared to the average Facebook user, and the study only included people who said they were on Facebook for more than 15 minutes every day.

Homeless Descend Into the Subways For Relief From a Relentless Chill

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
As commuters shuffled through the Lexington Avenue-53rd Street subway station on Thursday morning, Tyrone Cooper serenaded the bundled-up passengers with his usual renditions of popular tunes.
But Mr. Cooper's performance also came with a warning: "It's too cold to be outside right now. You can get sick and die out there."
As a cold spell cloaked New York, with temperatures reaching only into the teens, city officials urged residents to limit their time outside. But for the homeless, options were limited.
Mr. Cooper, like countless others without shelter, sought protection in transit stations and on trains. He spent Wednesday night on the subway's E line, a popular refuge in the winter because the train stays underground during its 50-minute trip between Queens and Lower Manhattan.
The merciless chill arrived from the Midwest, walloping the region and interrupting daily routines. New Jersey Transit disruptions on Thursday morning frustrated commuters who were stuck waiting outside for trains, and Newark Liberty International Airport was reporting delays into the afternoon because of weather and wind.
Some suburban schools delayed or canceled classes. City public schools and government offices remained open.
The outlook for Thursday night was no better: a low of 10 degrees. Temperatures are expected to climb into the 20s and 30s on Friday.
[Follow the latest updates on the polar vortex.]
On Thursday morning, Mr. Cooper, 63, seemed in good spirits despite the deep freeze. He was posted in the Lexington Avenue station with his microphone and speaker, singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" and "Ain't No Sunshine" in hopes of collecting tips.
"This is like being in your living room," he said. "I mean not your living room, but compared to some places, this is really a good place to be at because it's not too cold. You don't even need a cup of coffee."
Mr. Cooper, who has been homeless for the past two years, said he prefers this station because the platforms are far from the entrances, minimizing drafts. The platform was noticeably warmer than other stations in the city.
On days like these, many homeless New Yorkers prefer staying underground to checking into a shelter.
"The shelter environment is so hostile," said Leopold Wiseman, 37, who has been homeless for about 15 years, as he rested on a bench at the Queens Plaza subway station, also on the E line. "You have to spend all your energy trying to survive."
In 2018, The New York Times found several dozen homeless people -- including some just released from the hospital -- on each E train during frigid nights in January.
The city's most recent estimate of the population found 3,675 homeless people on the streets, in parks and on subways on a single winter night in 2018 -- 48 percent of whom were in the subways. For years, officials have grappled with how to help.
The Bowery Residents' Committee, a nonprofit that contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city, sends outreach workers through the subways and commuter rail stations to try to bring the homeless into shelters. When temperatures drop below freezing, the city issues a "Code Blue" alert, and the workers check in more frequently.
"This weather obviously increases the risk to a vulnerable population," Andy Byford, who oversees the subways, said in a statement. "We are working with the city and N.Y.P.D. to get vulnerable people the help and shelter they need in this extreme cold weather, while taking steps at the same time to maintain a pleasant and safe traveling environment for our riders."
This winter, the M.T.A. helped increase the number of Bowery committee outreach workers, including at Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal. At those stations, an M.T.A. spokesman said, the authority has deployed 24 additional transit officers to assist the homeless. The M.T.A. has also provided the Bowery Residents' Committee extra funding for more beds for the homeless.
But Walter Miller Foster Jr. said he was just counting the days until he could spend less time indoors or underground.
"I prefer to be in the parks," said Mr. Foster, who has been homeless for about 20 years. "That's where no one will bother you. It's public domain. I can just hang out and chill."

Texto completo: The Asian action star Jackie Chan has been often compared to Buster Keaton (no one takes a fall better) and sometimes to Douglas Fairbanks (whose acrobatic grace he equals in vaulting over a wall). But I'm always fascinated by his moves: Chan is the Fred Astaire of outrageous mayhem.
A child who, starting at age 7, attended an academy for Chinese opera and martial arts in his native Hong Kong, Chan was an international star well before he came to the attention of most American moviegoers. His breakthrough film, "Police Story" (1985), and its inevitable first sequel, "Police Story II" (1988), both digitally restored, are playing together at the Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn.
A small part alongside Burt Reynolds in "The Cannonball Run" (1981) failed to ignite Chan's career in the United States. Until "Police Story" was included in the 1987 New York Film Festival, his New York fans often went to Chinatown's movie houses to enjoy his comic windmill kick-box, karate-chop, tumble-out-of-a-third-story-window thing.
The incongruity of screening this violent slapstick at Lincoln Center was not lost on The New York Times critic Vincent Canby, who advised those who missed the festival shows that they could "catch up with more or less the same kind of thing on virtually any day of the week on 42d Street, where comic kung fu movies are treated not as cinematic epiphanies but as unpretentious comedies for people whose minds, like their feet, wander when not nailed to the floor."
Indeed, "Police Story" -- which Chan directed as well as starred in as a diligent but absent-minded cop -- would be little more than a bang-bang procedural were it not for a number of impossibly kinetic set pieces. The scene in which Chan, who did all of his own stunts, employs the handle of an umbrella to hang on to a moving bus is easier to describe than the gyrations he uses to confound six bad guys armed with clubs or ride a large shopping mall chandelier down to the ground. The sound of broken glass is Chan's theme song. His directorial stunts are epitomized by a choreographed sequence that destroys an entire hillside shantytown.
"Police Story" is largely the sum of its action scenes although it's also enjoyable to watch the villains wield cellphones the size of cinder blocks, or see the very young Maggie Cheung as Chan's long-suffering girlfriend. (Brigitte Lin, another leading Hong Kong star, is also in the movie as the witness whom Chan's police officer must protect.)
"Police Story II," showing as a separate admission, appears never to have been reviewed in The Times. Production values are higher and the havoc quotient is lower, despite several elaborate explosions. The tiresome toilet humor is partly compensated for by some impressively orchestrated gags -- involving chain reactions worthy of Rube Goldberg -- and a fireworks display that brings down the abandoned factory where the final battle is staged.
The best part of a Chan production can be the humorous montage of outtakes that accompany the closing credits. As if to offset the diminished violence in "Police Story II," the coda shows real injuries and actual blood.

Trump pushes for US firms on federal projects

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Thursday that will push for federal dollars spent on infrastructure projects to be put toward US companies and bolster workers who his top trade adviser described as “blue-collar Trump people" the administration has focused on helping.
That description, given to reporters by Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, was a glimpse at how the administration has sought to carry out the president's “America First" policy.
The executive order is meant to be an economic shot-in-the-arm for workers held up as symbols of the president's tough-on-trade stance, even as some have faced shaky economic prospects over the administration's decisions to impose high tariffs on imported goods and to start several global disputes, including a damaging trade war with China.
Navarro later changed his comment about the administration's policies benefiting “Trump people."
He said “every American is a Trump person" but added that the bulk of manufacturing jobs go to people without college degrees and “exactly the type of people that the Trump administration has so much focus on: American men and women who work with their hands."
Trump said the reasoning behind the order was that “we don't get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals." The president added he wanted infrastructure projects to be built with “American steel," “American iron," and “American hands."
The executive order, “Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects," will recommend but not outright require that what the administration said was $700 billion in federal financial assistance doled out by some 30 agencies each year go toward US-manufactured products. The order will also seek to tamp down on waivers that agencies have used to bypass US products in favor of foreign-made ones.
The order is a continuation of the “Buy American" strategy Trump unveiled within his first few months in office. In April 2017, the president signed an executive order that would favor US companies for federal contracts and reform the H-1B visa program for foreign technical workers, a move that led Democrats to say the administration would curb the hiring of qualified foreign workers.

Sanders wants to lower estate tax threshold
Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate known for far-left stances on issues of economic inequality, introduced legislation on Thursday that would increase the number of wealthy Americans subject to the estate tax.
With the bill, Sanders joins a growing chorus of liberal politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich. Last week, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has announced her 2020 candidacy, introduced a plan for a so-called ultramillionaire tax on households with a net worth of $50 million or more. And Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently proposed a 70 percent top rate on income over $10 million a year, intensifying the conversation within the Democratic Party about tax policies aimed at addressing income inequality.
In his plan, Sanders proposed applying an estate tax when someone leaves assets worth more than $3.5 million to his or her heirs, the same level as in 2009. The plan significantly lowers the threshold under the current tax law, passed in late 2017, which raised the amount an individual is allowed to transfer before facing any estate tax to roughly $11 million; couples can pass on twice that much.
The tax-the-rich proposals, including the one introduced by Sanders, are designed to increase revenue to pay for expanded social programs like “Medicare for all."
Though Sanders, 77, has not yet announced he is running for president, he appears to be actively moving toward a 2020 campaign.
Republicans have repeatedly tried to thwart efforts to broaden the estate tax, which they call the “death tax." President Trump has described the estate tax as “crushing," “horrible," and “unfair," and on Monday, three Republican senators including Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, introduced legislation to permanently repeal the estate tax. Trump and other opponents of the estate tax have positioned a repeal as a way to help farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.
Sanders's estate tax plan, which he said would affect the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans, is similar to one he introduced during his 2016 presidential campaign, when he finished second to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary race. Sanders also supports the idea of a wealth tax, which he outlined in a list of financing options for “Medicare for all."

Cain considered for place on Federal Reserve Board
Herman Cain, the former pizza company executive who ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, is being considered by President Trump for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
Cain, 73, was in the White House on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Two seats on the Fed board are vacant, but nominating Cain raises the prospect of a Senate confirmation hearing focused on the sexual harassment and infidelity accusations that ended his presidential campaign.
Cain in September cofounded a pro-Trump super PAC, America Fighting Back PAC, which features a photo of the president on its website and says: “We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment."
Cain had a long corporate career and is also familiar with the Federal Reserve system. From 1992 to 1996, he served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as well as deputy chairman and then chairman. He advocated for the United States to return to the gold standard during his presidential campaign and as recently as December 2017 defended higher interest rates, a position that contrasts with Trump's repeated criticisms of the Fed last year.
Cain ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but dropped out in late 2011 after allegations he engaged in sexual harassment when he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. An Atlanta woman said she had had an extramarital affair with Cain for more than 13 years.
He called the allegations false but said he had “made mistakes in my life." Although his candidacy was considered a long shot, he had led in some national polls.
Cain's syndicated radio show on Cox Media ended last year. In addition to Godfather's, he was a top executive at the Coca-Cola Co. and Pillsbury Co.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan government's control of its country declined late last year, in terms of both territory and population, according to a United States government report released Thursday.
The report, by the agency of the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction, or Sigar, said that as of Oct. 31, the Afghan government controlled territory on which 63.5 percent of its population lived, a decrease of 1.7 percent from the previous quarter, while gains by the Taliban insurgency gave it control over territory that is home to 10.8 percent of the population.
The agency's statistics are based on data provided by the American military under a mandate to report to Congress quarterly.
In addition, the Afghan government lost control of seven more districts during the last quarter, meaning that only 53.8 percent of districts were "controlled or influenced" by the government, while 12.3 percent of the districts were under insurgent control or influence and 33.9 percent of districts were contested. Afghanistan's 407 districts are the basic unit of local governance.
John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghan reconstruction, whose agency issued the report, said in an interview, "It's like moving the goal posts, something we've seen a lot of over the last few years."
In response to the report, the American military said that such metrics, which have been compiled quarterly for many years, were no longer important and might be based on faulty analysis.
"Measures of population control are not indicative of effectiveness of the South Asia strategy or of progress toward security and stability in Afghanistan, particularly in the wake of the appointment of U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation (SRAR) Zalmay Khalilzad," the Pentagon said in a statement.
The military also said there was "uncertainty" and "subjectivity" in the data used to analyze population control.
Mr. Sopko said that was the first time the military had criticized its own data on population control, which he said appeared to be a response to the increasingly pessimistic picture of government control.
Mr. Khalilzad has been leading talks with the Taliban, and last week reached a preliminary agreement with them on a framework that would call for American troop withdrawal in exchange for assurances that terrorists would not be allowed to use Afghanistan as a base of operations.
The latest inspector general's report also expressed concern at the declining size of the Afghan security forces, which it said had 3,635 fewer personnel compared with the previous quarter. With a total of 308,693 personnel, the security forces are at 87.7 percent of their authorized strength, the report said, the lowest since the Afghan government took over full responsibility for the country's security in January 2015.
The attrition was due to desertions, failure to re-enlist and "ghost" soldiers who remain on the payroll, as well as casualties.
President Ashraf Ghani said this month that 45,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had died since he took office in September 2014. During that same period, he said, 72 American or coalition soldiers were killed. American military leaders had described Afghan losses as "not sustainable" when they were only half of what they are currently.
Afghan officials say they are killing equal or greater numbers of Taliban militants, but there is little hard evidence to back up such claims.
[Read The New York Times weekly compilation of Afghan casualty reports.]
The quarterly compilation of data on population and territorial control has long been controversial among experts on Afghanistan, who view the inspector general's accounts from the American military as too optimistic. Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argues that the military's statistics on district control are lumped into categories that give little real sense of who is in charge.
His own analysis in The Long War Journal has the Afghan government controlling 143 of the country's districts (35 percent) and the insurgents 53 districts (13 percent), with 202 districts contested (49.6 percent).
"USFOR-A's claim that control is not an important factor is absurd on its face," Mr. Roggio said, using the acronym for the American military in Afghanistan. "The Taliban use areas under its influence to raise taxes, produce opium, recruit and train fighters, and stage attacks on areas under government control."
In a separate report released Tuesday, the advocacy group Transparency International found that Afghanistan was still among the 10 most corrupt countries in the world, despite pledges by the current government to address the issue.
"The result has been diminishing government legitimacy and trust among Afghans and donor fatigue," said Nadia Bazidwal, a board member from the group's Afghan office.

Fall behind on your student loans? You could lose your license to work. Texas lawmakers want to change that.

Texto completo: Texas Legislature 2019
The 86th Legislature runs from Jan. 8 to May 27. From the state budget to health care to education policy — and the politics behind it all — we focus on what Texans need to know about the biennial legislative session.
More in this series
From the most conservative faction of the Texas House to a liberal stalwart in the Senate, lawmakers from both major political parties are trying to change a state statute that can hinder teachers, dentists, nurses and other professional license holders from working if they fall behind on their student loans.
A March report from The Texas Tribune found more than 4,200 Texans were at risk of losing their licenses to work in 2017 because they were in default on their loan payments. Occurring alongside a national push to overhaul occupational licensing regulations, the practice caught the attention of state legislators, and the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus quickly committed to reforming the Texas laws.
It “seems very counterintuitive to take away someone's occupational license for failure to pay student loans," said state Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, a member of the caucus and author of one of the bills. “If the person can no longer work, then how are they supposed to pay back the loans? There are other ways to keep individuals accountable for their debts."
The Texas provision, which dates to the 1980s, affects occupational license holders like cosmetologists, dentists and teachers — some 250 of whom had applications to renew their teaching licenses denied because of student loan debt between 2013 and 2018, according to data from the Texas Education Agency.
Among those teachers was Roderick Scott Sr., a Dallas-based instructor. Scott told the Tribune last year that he had been shocked to find there was a hold on his teacher’s license in 2015. Although he immediately contacted his loan collector to try to rectify the problem, it was just the beginning of what became a financial nightmare.
To retain his job at a middle school, Scott put his loan payments before rent and other bills. His bank account was garnished, he was evicted and he ultimately had to file for bankruptcy.
“It's sad. He didn't tell his students [of his financial difficulties]; he didn't tell his kids — and he's got to prioritize, do I pay my mortgage?” said state Rep. Cesar Blanco, D-El Paso. “When somebody loses their license to work, it doesn't make them pay their loans, it only puts them in further financial distress.”
“While I understand the law's intent previously — that it may bring attention to default — borrowers are in a worse position to pay back their loans without any income,” he said.
Blanco is one of three Democrats and three Republicans who have filed bills since November to address the issue. Krause; state Rep. Ana Hernandez, D-Houston; and state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, have put forth identical measures that would “end this nonsensical policy in Texas,” Zaffirini said.
State Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, and state Sen. Dawn Buckingham, R-Lakeway, have authored similar measures.
The bipartisan interest, along with the number of bills filed, has left lawmakers hopeful substantive change can happen this session. Zaffirini said the "coalition of legislators" and the little opposition registered is a "strong signal that the Legislature will come together to address this issue" in 2019.
"While getting a bill to Gov. [Greg] Abbott’s desk is always a challenge," Buckingham said, her measure is a "commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation that I expect will have support in both chambers." Abbott, a Republican, already has announced his support for one of the bills.
If passed, the legislation would remove the portion of state law that makes student loan default grounds to revoke, suspend or not renew a professional license. Those in default on their student loans would still risk having their wages garnished, their tax refunds withheld or lawsuits filed against them.
A division in Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office collects on loans issued by the state. A private nonprofit called Trellis Company, which was once a public entity, performs a similar function for old loans made by the federal government.
Donna Fritz, a spokeswoman for Trellis, said the corporation isn't taking a position on the bills. She said in a statement that the organization’s “primary interest is in helping the federal student loan borrowers who come to us get out of default with programs that can cost as little as $5 per month. Once they’re out of default, we help them take advantage of the many repayment options available, especially those based on income.”
The attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Originally thought of as an incentive to keep borrowers current on their payments, the practice of suspending or stripping professional licenses as a penalty has fallen out of favor across the country. Bills overturning the provision have been introduced in Alaska, Illinois, Washington and other states, after a New York Times investigation found 19 states had laws in place allowing the practice.
On the federal level, legislation sponsored by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, would bar states from revoking or refusing to issue professional licenses due to the status of an applicant’s federal student loan debt.
“These are commonsense steps to get rid of something that is counterproductive to paying off debt,” said Rob D’Amico, a spokesperson for the Texas affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers.
Scott, the Dallas-based teacher, said Wednesday that he was "overjoyed" to hear about the proposed bills.
"I wish it could have occurred sooner, so I could have not gone through it," he said while tidying and preparing for the next school day. "But I don't mind having to go through something if it's going to benefit others. That makes it worth it to me."

Texto completo: ATLANTA — He is Tom Hagen in “The Godfather." He is Doug Stamper on “House of Cards."
He is Berj Najarian, consigliere to Bill Belichick. He is The Man To See if you want to see Bill.
“You're never going to get to Bill unless you go through Berj," said Scott Zolak, a Patriot insider for three decades. “Berj is the guy who dictates who Bill talks to."
“Everybody knows Berj runs the show down there," added Troy Brown, a three-time Super Bowl winner with Belichick. “You had to go to Berj for everything. You'd walk in the front door and the first guy you'd see is Berj. He was in charge the whole time I was there."
Najarian is one of the most powerful figures on the Boston sports landscape, yet most fans have never heard of him. There isn't much to find about him on the Internet. Najarian makes no sound and leaves no footprints.
He is a behind-the-scenes guy who does not want anyone in the Patriots family to think he is seeking attention. Seven years ago, in a moment of weakness, he gave the New York Times a one-paragraph, snooze-filled statement regarding his duties (“helping uphold the standard of excellence set by the Kraft family" blah-blah), but he has no intention of being so reckless again.
When I asked to interview him for this story, it went like this.
Me: “Can I talk to you for five minutes for a story on you?"
Berj: “You'll have to ask Bill."
Me: “I can't ask Bill without going through you first."
Berj: “We'll get back to you."
I heard from Berj later that night. He said he'd rather not break his Ripkenesque streak of not giving quotes to the media.
Najarian's official title in the Patriots media guide is “Director of Football/Head Coach Administration."
Working from a Gillette Stadium office adjoined to Belichick's, Najarian handles the logistics of Belichick's workday. He decides who sits where on the team plane. He selects the music for practice. He doles out speaking gigs to assistant coaches if the Patriots are approached by corporations. He prioritizes.
He combs through all media coverage of the Patriots (an overwhelming tonnage of digital, ink, and radio/TV noise) and decides what Bill needs to see and hear. He seeks out reporters who he believes have been unfair to his boss or the Patriot Way. I can't prove it, but I believe he has a Nixonian enemies list.
Any time you see Belichick standing at a podium at any news conference, you can see Berj off to the side, deep in the background, monitoring the proceedings while checking his Smartphone.
“His ability to absorb everything around him, with eyes in the back of his head, is the most impressive thing," said Zolak. “He takes the information and puts it through the strainer: what the coach should and should not see. Berj has a real good ear for that."
After Wednesday's media session at the Super Bowl, I cornered Belichick for a few words about his ubiquitous wingman.
“What does Berj do for you?" I started.
“We could probably talk about that for a week," said the coach. “He does a lot. There's football, non-football. Scheduling. Just a lot of things I need to be aware of and logistical things that need to be taken care of. Some things we talk about and some things he just knows what he needs to do.
“Berj gets along with people great. He has great relationships with almost everybody. I think everybody likes him and he's good to work with. He's smart. He's very dedicated and team-oriented and unselfish. He'll do what's best for the team and he'll work with anybody and is able to be productive with them.
“Sometimes there's a conflict in how things need to go, and he does a good job in compromising and finding a middle ground where everybody can feel they have a workable situation."
Bob Kraft has called Najarian “one of our hidden weapons."
Hidden.
It is the Patriot Way.
Paranoia and secrecy strike deep in the heart of Foxborough. Assistant coaches are rarely made available. Ernie Adams (Bill's replay-challenge whisperer) speaks to no one. Players are told what to say, and all outsiders are processed through “Security Command."
In this spirit, Najarian is a perfect fit for Fort Foxborough.
Najarian, 49, grew up on Long Island, played baseball at Manhasset (high school home of running back Jim Brown), then played a year of baseball at Boston University before graduating with a liberal arts degree in 1991. He worked in the PR office of the New York Knicks during their NBA Finals season of 1993-94, then moved over to the New York Jets in 1995.
Young Najarian attached himself to Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and beat reporters learned that if you wanted to get Keyshawn, you had to go through Berj.
In 1997, when Belichick came to the Jets with Bill Parcells (who was famous for not allowing his assistants to talk to the media), Najarian hitched his wagon to the grumpy defensive coordinator. They worked out on treadmills, side by side, and according to Ian O'Connor's bestselling book “Belichick," “They talked about ways Little Bill could better deal with the media while working around Big Bill's restrictions."
When Belichick got the Patriots job, the Hoodie did not want to repeat the media mistakes he made as head coach in Cleveland. He wanted his own guy. He brought Najarian with him to Foxborough.
“I knew him because of the PR connection with the Jets," said Belichick. “We would play other teams and he would get PR material from them. It was a little different then. I would ask him to keep an eye out for articles relevant to our next game, like, 'what are they saying about this guy's knee?' or things like that. That's how we got started.
“I needed somebody to do the non-football stuff. Somebody who was not a coach. As a head coach, you deal with a lot of non-football things that relate to the job. Berj and I talked about different options and he said, 'Why don't I just do that?' And I said, 'Well, let's see how it goes.' "
Belichick bringing his own guy to Foxborough created an awkward situation in the Patriots PR office. Ever-capable Patriots PR director Stacey James, a Kraft favorite, had been on the job in New England for seven years when Belichick was named coach. Kraft solved the issue by allowing Belichick to hire Najarian as part of the “football staff."
James and Najarian have delicately worked around one another for almost 20 years. But if you call Patriots PR looking for the coach, the PR director will send you to Najarian.
Najarian is a rabid sports fan who attended the NFC Championship game that sent Belichick to his first Super Bowl with the Giants. He was at Shea Stadium the night the Mets beat the Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. He treasures a Ken Griffey Jr. baseball he caught during Home Run Derby when the All-Star Game came to Fenway Park in 1999.
Najarian was teased early in his Patriot career when Drew Bledsoe and friends sent a dozen roses to his stadium office on National Secretaries Day. More than a decade later, when the Patriots visited the White House, a bold Najarian had enough confidence to wear an Armenian flag pin (which Belichick also wore) and challenge Barack Obama for not using the word “genocide" when describing the mass murder of 1.5 million Armenians early in the 20th century.
Berj and Regina Najarian are raising two children in a Wellesley home that has a considerable link to Patriot history. Through sheer coincidence, Bill Belichick's trusted associate bought a house that was once owned by Patriots founder Billy Sullivan.
“Berj's house is the same house where my dad got the call from Lamar Hunt telling him that he had the final franchise in the American Football League," said Patrick Sullivan, a former general manager of the Patriots.
So there. The guardian at the Belichick gate goes to sleep every night in the house where the Patriots were born.
I wanted to ask Bill about all of this, but time is tight during Super Bowl week, and my private Q-and-A with the coach did not stretch long into the afternoon. Before I got a fourth question out, Berj emerged from behind a curtain, motioned toward Belichick, pointed at his watch, and said, “We've got to go."

Trump workers seek protection

Texto completo: An attorney who represents undocumented immigrants who have worked at President Donald Trump's golf courses in New Jersey and New York said Tuesday that he is seeking deportation protection for his clients so they can share allegations of harassment, abuse and immigration fraud that they said they witnessed and experienced at work.
Anibal Romero, who has a law practice in Newark and represents 20 undocumented immigrants who say they have worked at the Trump National Golf Clubs in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Briarcliff Manor, New York, said the Trump Organization is a "criminal enterprise" that has hired undocumented immigrants for years. Some of these workers, he said, have been physically abused and threatened with deportation.
"All of them are material witnesses to a federal crime, and any attempt to try and remove them from the United States could possibly be obstruction of justice," he said in a conference call with reporters, saying that he has received calls from other workers of the Trump Organization who live in other parts of the country.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Romero was joined on the conference call by D. Taylor, president of UNITE Here, the hotel and restaurant workers union; and David Leopold, a partner with Ulmer & Berne LLP and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Romero said he has met this week with several lawmakers, including New Jersey's Democratic senators, Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, seeking their support for "deferred action."
Menendez met Tuesday morning in Washington with several undocumented immigrants who worked at Trump properties, according to Steven Sandberg, a spokesman, who added that Menendez supports "congressional oversight" in the matter.
A call to Booker's office was not immediately returned Tuesday.
About a dozen workers at Trump National in Westchester County, including landscapers and housekeepers, were fired this month because they were in the country illegally, according to a report by The Washington Post.
The firings came about a month after The New York Times reported that undocumented immigrants had submitted fraudulent documentation when they were hired to work as housekeepers at Trump National in Bedminster, and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though they said management was aware of their legal status.
Romero, who is calling for congressional, federal and state investigations into the matter, said he has received calls from both the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, which he said asked him for documentation, and the New York Attorney General's Office. He said he is scheduling a meeting with officials in the New York office.
Leland Moore, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, declined to comment, saying that the office does not confirm or deny investigations.
The undocumented immigrants were working at Trump businesses as Trump campaigned on curbing illegal immigration, and more recently as he has pushed for funding for a border wall, setting up a fight with Democrats in Congress that resulted in the longest partial government shutdown in the country's history.
"We have a situation whereby we have a president who has criminalized, demonized, dehumanized and blamed immigrant workers, both as he was running for president and as president," said Taylor, whose union represents more than 275,000 hotel and restaurant workers, a majority of whom are immigrants, people of color and women. "And at the same time, we have the exact same organization hiring, abusing workers, who he says are responsible for crime in this country, and in fact all they are doing is working hard providing for themselves and their families and trying to have a better life."
Romero and Taylor said the undocumented workers were not given health insurance or retirement benefits, and that they were paid less than their counterparts who had legal status. Romero said there was no "upward mobility," meaning access to promotions, for his clients. One woman he represents was demoted from her role as a supervisor when they found out she was undocumented, he said.
"I think it's up to lawmakers now to investigate this as a criminal activity, but also both Republicans and Democrats have to step up and really deal with the immigration issue in a comprehensive way," Taylor said. "What the Trump organization has done is not unique in this country, but what is unique is we have the head of that organization be the president."
One of the women profiled in the Times story, Victorina Morales, spoke Tuesday during the conference call. A native of Guatemala, Morales said she arrived in the United States in 1999 and that she worked for Trump National in Bedminster for five years and had access to his living quarters while he was running for president. When Trump was elected, she said, she was told she would no longer be allowed to work in his residence.
She was later told that she had to resubmit her documentation, including her residency and Social Security cards. When she first was hired, she had submitted fraudulent documentation. She said a supervisor helped her get new fraudulent paperwork for $165, and that they took pictures for the green card at the golf course. Morales previously told the Times that she ended up borrowing $165 from a manager at the resort to pay someone in Plainfield for a new bogus Social Security number and phony green card to replace the ones she had initially submitted for the position.
She said she has been subjected to verbal abuse several times, and that one supervisor pushed her against the wall three times.
"That's when I thought that the reason she is acting this way is because of the way the president speaks on TV," Morales said in Spanish, with Romero translating. "There are a lot of people who want to speak, but I'm sure they are afraid because there were a lot of threats.
"If someone filed a lawsuit, they would call immigration," she added.
Leopold said the allegations emphasize the need for comprehensive immigration reform.
"This case underscores not only the criminal activity of the president of the United States and his businesses and his family, but underscores a problem in this country that in a way we are all complicit in," he said, "and that is allowing a permanent underclass of worker to go on, and that needs to stop."

Texto completo: Polar vortex will put millions into deep freeze
Record-smashing cold is expected across a wide swath of the USA beginning Tuesday as the polar vortex sweeps Arctic air across the Great Lakes. Low temperatures Tuesday night will dip to 30 below zero across much of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, AccuWeather warned. Temperatures in Chicago could drop to 25 below zero for the first time since the mid-1980s. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, warned that "this is the coldest air many of us will have ever experienced" and that folks outside should "avoid taking deep breaths, and minimize talking. " Some schools, zoos and businesses will be closed due to the weather, which has already forced airlines to cancel more than 900 Tuesday flights. To make matters worse, a snowstorm will also wreak havoc across the Deep South. If you're planning to brave the elements, make sure to stay warm by choosing a weather-appropriate outfit and knowing the signs of hypothermia and frostbite.

Smithsonian museums reopen
In one of the more visible signs of a fully operational government since the Jan. 25 end of the partial shutdown, Smithsonian museums in Washington and elsewhere reopen Tuesday. Beside the Air and Space and other major museums along the Mall as well as such institutions as Hazy Center at Dulles Airport and New York City's American Indian Museum, the openings also include another Smithsonian D. C. favorite, the National Zoo. One institution, the Renwick Gallery, won't open till Saturday. In lamenting the shutdown last week, Smithsonian Secretary David J. Skorton reminded USA TODAY readers of the cultural importance of the world’s largest museum, research and education complex.
PG&E files for bankruptcy amid California wildfire suits
Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. , America's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday, as it faces billions in potential damages from wildfires in California. It came after company officials said the utility company cannot afford an estimated $30 billion in costs related to the state's deadly 2017 and 2018 wildfires. California law makes utilities entirely liable for damage from wildfires sparked by their equipment, regardless of whether they are found to be negligent. On Monday, officials said that insurance claims from the November 2018 wildfires topped $11. 4 billion, making the series of fires some of the most expensive in state history. More than $8 billion losses stem from the fire that leveled the town of Paradise, killing 86 people and destroying roughly 15,000 homes — the other $3 billion are from two Southern California wildfires that ignited the same week in November. The PG&E bankruptcy would consolidate victims’ lawsuits and could potentially leave thousands of wildfire victims without compensation.
New book by Christie takes Trump team to task
A new memoir by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will contain "startling insights" about President Donald Trump and his administration, according to publisher Hachette Books. "Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics," is scheduled to hit bookstores Tuesday. In a New York Times report based on an advance copy of the book, Christie says Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner believed firing former national security adviser Michael Flynn would resolve the "Russia thing. " While Christie described Flynn as "a train wreck from beginning to end," according to the Times, he says he was sure Trump was wrong about the Russia probe. "'Sir,' I said, 'This Russia thing is far from over,'" Christie wrote.

Texto completo: At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices.
The story behind the photo essay in this week's issue of The Times Magazine starts in the 1980s, when a young Irish man named John Burke immigrated to London from Clonmel, Ireland, after the death of his mother. Struggling to adjust, Burke found himself drawn to a local mosque in his neighborhood that preached a radical interpretation of Islam. He soon changed his name to Muhammad Omar and followed the call of jihad to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan to fight the Soviet-backed Afghan government with the mujahedeen. Burke's life ended in April 1989, shortly after he arrived in the country, most likely after he accidentally stepped on a land mine. (There are varying accounts of how he died.) His full story was recorded in a 2010 profile written by Mary Fitzgerald for The Irish Times.
In 2012, Ross McDonnell, an Irish filmmaker and photographer who had traveled to Afghanistan to produce a documentary about Burke's life and death, heard about the "gallery of legs" that hung in an International Committee of the Red Cross clinic in Jalalabad, a city in the eastern part of Afghanistan -- the same place where Burke's remains were said to be buried.
What McDonnell found were the homemade prosthetics left behind by Afghans who received new limbs from the I.C.R.C.'s orthopedic clinic when it first opened in 1995. The relics stood out to McDonnell as symbols of the country's national identity that has been transformed by 40 years of war. "In every part of the room patients were being treated for their various stages of limblessness," McDonnell said. "Some in wheelchairs, some on crutches. An old Afghan man with his long, groomed beard walked around on his new leg. Rested. Watched television. Walked around some more. A proper veteran."
I.C.R.C. is one of the few organizations that offer Afghans cost-free and sustainable medical treatment for amputations and other injuries. It has been working in the country for 30 years and has provided more than 109,000 prosthetics to Afghans since the orthopedic program started. Many of the people who seek assistance were injured by roadside bombs, airstrikes or undetonated bomblets leftover from American cluster munitions dropped after the initial U.S.-backed invasion in 2001. In 2017, a third of the clinic's patients were children, who are often taken on field trips to learn how to recognize and avoid stray ordnance. In a recent profile written by Mujib Mashal for The Times, Alberto Cairo, the head of I.C.R.C.'s physical rehabilitation program, described how these injuries are about more than physical loss. "When you lose a leg, you don't just lose a leg -- you lose a piece of heart, you lose a piece of mind, you lose a piece of self-confidence."

Despite the grim reality that McDonnell's photos depict, they also demonstrate the resourcefulness of a people who once relied on clothing, scrap metal and tape to build and maintain their own artificial appendages. It's this intimate sense of survival that makes McDonnell's photos stand out and that reminds us of a past era of a war that has yet to end.

TIMES EVENT: Civilian Casualties of the War on Terror
Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019 | New York City
A rare convergence of experts on the human costs of war will discuss the often-ignored outgrowth of the global war on terror: two decades of civilian casualties. Times journalist and Marine Corps infantry veteran C. J. Chivers, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his 2016 story about an Afghan war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, will moderate the discussion. The panelists are Alissa J. Rubin, the Times Paris bureau chief who won a Pulitzer Prize for foreign reporting on Afghanistan in 2015; Azmat Khan, an investigative reporter and New York Times Magazine contributor, who uncovered civilian casualties among nearly 150 airstrike sites across northern Iraq; and writer Brian Castner, a veteran of the Iraq war and weapons expert for Amnesty International's crisis team, who also investigates war crimes and human rights violations.

5G networks, the Trump administration, and Beijing's delicious fear

Texto completo: On Monday, Chinese state media published a new editorial of great importance to U.S. interests. The Global Times declared that "referring to 5G competition as an arms race and attaching so much importance to the dominance of the technology is typical American thinking."

It isn't that hard to understand why President Xi Jinping is so mad about 5G. To achieve that which drives his global hegemonic ambition, Xi must usurp U.S. trading relationships, undercut U.S. alliances, and, most relevant here, steal U.S. intellectual property.

But that task is a lot harder if the U.S. limits China's appropriation of technology and hacking of global information flows. And that's exactly what the Trump administration is now doing. The U.S. issued new sanctions against Huawei on Monday. That adds to the motivation for the Global Times editorial.

What prompted the Global Times' editorial was a New York Times report from Saturday, describing U.S. efforts to lobby foreign governments to stop Huawei and other Chinese technology firms from building 5G data networks. This shows, the Global Times says, that the U.S. is "completely ignoring business rules and savagely suppressing Huawei ... But Washington has no evidence of Huawei espionage, only imaginary accusations. Washington wants to deprive Chinese companies of their right to lead 5G technology. The U.S. is using geopolitics rather than market rules in 5G construction."

Coming from a government that treats business rules as a joke, that capriciously uses its technology firms as intelligence service cutouts, and that denies foreign companies any fair competition in China, this lament is the very summit of hypocrisy. Still, it targets a specific audience. Aware that its best strategy here is to manipulate global anti-American sentiments, the Global Times presents its argument as a moral narrative for global political equality: "Globalization greatly promoted the integration of all countries' interests and brought about a great evolution in distribution of profits. In the future, the power of a few select countries can no longer dominate the whole world."

No one should take China at its word. Instead, we should unequivocally endorse Trump administration and congressional action to restrain China's 5G activity. The simple point is that when it comes to international order, China is a master at saying the right thing and doing the opposite. In the New York Times report, for example, we see a reference to Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei's recent declaration that "I support the Communist Party of China. But I will never do anything to harm any other nation."

It sounds good, and alongside vast Chinese investments, these words are very tempting for many nations. But like those party elites he serves, Ren is a liar. This is an increasingly understood truth among U.S. and allied governments. The New York Times hints at it, but the U.S. and British intelligence communities have excelled in identifying the truly vast scale of Chinese cyber-espionage. It must be said here that Prime Minister Theresa May's support for the U.S. on China is far greater than that of her predecessor, David Cameron.

So where does all this leave Xi? With an understandable sense of fear. The Global Times shows Xi's fear that America that is slowly waking up to his game. If so, its editorial ends with a rather pathetic rejoinder. "The U.S. strategic vision for 5G," it says, "is lame and runs counter to the spirit of the times."

Wrong. This U.S. strategic vision is critical toward protecting free markets and preserving liberal democratic order in the 21st century. Accepting China's lie would be to kneel to a dragon that is determined to burn our better future.

Anthony Davis requests a trade from New Orleans, giving the Lakers an opportunity

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

I loved Facebook; after 12 years of daily use, here's why I'm unfriending it for good

Texto completo: It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook. It's not easy. We had a long, meaningful connection — my avatar had more than 1,200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.
Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value. For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.
I was an enthusiastic early adapter. I joined in early 2006, when there were fewer than 12 million members. So intriguing was the prospect of a world wide Rolodex, I forged an email address with an . edu suffix in order to qualify.
More: I deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.
Though well into my 50’s when Mark Zuckerberg launched his online club, I considered myself internet literate. I wrote for an online magazine, comfortably searched on Google, banked online and bought bargains on eBay. I used email daily and instant messaged my children.
Online becomes real life
But Facebook, guiding my idea of friendship from analog affection to digital distraction, became my entry into social media. Before joining, friendship had been an analog connection, exclusively three-dimensional, and suddenly it was accessible through another, limitless portal.
Social scientist Robin Dunbar holds that humans have a social connection capacity of roughly 150 individuals — (although I doubt marketing algorithms drive his research). But, in the beginning of Facebook, there were literally millions of additional friends to choose from.
In real life, I know when I’ve been unfriended and feel sadness with such a loss. But, recognizing the difference between human and avatar, I’d hardly notice falling off with a fair-weather Facebook friend.
My timeline was stacked with my Generation X, millennial colleagues and some childhood friends of my grown-up children. In the days before everyone had a Twitter game, The New York Times Magazine had an item about the most entertaining status updates on Facebook. A week or two later, one of these cyber celebrities requested my friendship. Flattered, I readily accepted, years before I learned the meaning of "FOMO. "
I searched for a few familiar names from high school, but my new virtual companions skewed much younger. Around 2008 a person whose name I didn’t recognize reached across the decades to befriend me. His profile showed he attended my high school class of 1967 and my memory conjured a shy boy among the coat locker-lined hallways, just outside of my field of vision.
With the mental image of him came a sharp, unpleasant recollection of my own adolescent judging. A little shaken that my history had so abruptly caught up with me, I messaged my former classmate, apologizing for the callow, dismissive teenager I had been. He replied graciously, feigning ignorance of my prehistoric microaggression. Unfortunately, though my social skills had improved since my teenage years, my digital interface abilities were still subpar. I slighted him again by accidentally deleting his friend request.
Meantime, I cyber-gifted virtual cupcakes, posted videos, and quoted song lyrics to my new pixilated pals. I wrote often on Slate, Aol and the Washington Post about Facebook’s college-age founder’s controversies and public presence. I was solidly team Zuckerberg when Aaron Sorkin’s film "The Social Network" was released in 2010. Although I was skeptical when my new friend Mark claimed his site would soon act as a “personalized” and customized news source, I was fully committed to sharing images of my 3-year old grandson.
I dreamed Facebook and I would grow old together, anticipating applications for home-bound seniors that could help us dote on our families.
Facebook: The anti-social network
By then radio stations, super markets and members of Congress had all signed up. Persons were depersonalized and “timelines” indeed became “news feeds” with unsubstantiated opinions sponsored by unknown pulpits dotting my virtual front page.
As the club got bigger, my younger friends drifted away to other social media. Suddenly, my boomer cohort came aboard. My 50-year class reunion in 2017 was organized via a closed group on the site.
Sadly, by then, the 2016 election had negatively colored my Facebook feed. Even before I learned that ersatz engagement may have impacted its results, the division and name calling among previously pleasant posters had gotten tiresome. I found myself mollifying my conservative contacts who were insulted by the indignation of my more liberal friends.
By last March, when Cambridge Analytica was suspected to have surreptitiously affected election results using tens of millions of Facebook members’ personal data, my ardor had dimmed more definitively. The massive security breach in September was proof the site was sloppy with my secrets. The final blow to our crumbling relationship came with December’s revelations that my once beloved was cheating on me with other commercial sites. My friendship facilitator had betrayed me. I was weary of being commodified.
As 2018 came to its inauspicious end, I posted a "Dear Facebook, it’s over," status update citing our lost faith. “The trust is gone in our relationship. ”
Our separation is cordial. I have not deleted the software from my laptop despite helpful instructions online on how to archive and sever. It seems too soon to be burning portals.
I changed my status to “closed” and have gone silent, with a sentimental sigh for lost love. I like to think my contacts are continuing the conversation without me.

POWER SUITS: IS IT OK TO TALK ABOUT WHAT FEMALE POLITICIANS WEAR? IS IT FAIR TO TALK ABOUT WHAT FEMALE POLITICIANS WEAR?

Texto completo: There's a debate happening these days in politics and it has nothing to do with the federal government shutdown.
Since members of the 116th U.S. Congress were sworn in earlier this month, there's been a lot of talk about what some of them wore - particularly women - and whether it should even be a subject of discussion.
The hot pink pantsuit that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wore was a "beacon of fuchsia in a sea of blue," wrote Harper's Bazaar when she was shown seated alongside new Democratic committee chairmen earlier this month.
The California U.S. representative also turned heads in a vibrant pink dress at the Capitol as she once again became House speaker. She took "back her power looking both fierce and feminine," according to a column on The Washington Post's website.
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York showed up for her first day on the job in a white pantsuit accented with oversized gold hoop earrings and red lipstick.
"I wore all white today to honor the women who paved the path before me and for all the women yet to come," she shared on Twitter. "From suffragettes to Shirley Chisholm, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the mothers of the movement."
The press and public pontificating on politicians' clothes is nothing new. Even male lawmakers have been called out for the fit of their suits and choice of tie color (or tie length in President Donald Trump's case). But the record number of women who won seats in Congress this term has put the topic back on the table.
Is that fair? It depends on whom you ask. Vanessa Friedman, The New York Times' chief fashion critic, argued in a column that it's not sexist for her to dissect the way Ms. Pelosi dresses after the newspaper received letters to the editor and comments on social media that suggested otherwise.
"For starters, dress is, without question, an important part of a politician's tool kit," Ms. Friedman wrote, adding that she's also written about Mr. Trump's suits, Jeb Bush's shirt sleeves and Marco Rubio's shoes. "In an increasingly visual age, how you look is part of the message you are communicating."
Do local women in politics agree? The Post-Gazette asked a couple of them to weigh in on the subject of politics, gender and personal style.
Marita Garrett
Ms. Garrett, the mayor of Wilkinsburg, says personal style can be a way to send a message. That's why she often sports an "Unbought & Unbossed" pin on her lapel. It's associated with Ms. Chisholm, a New York Democrat who became the first black woman elected to Congress in 1968.
"Her legacy [had an] impact on me," Ms. Garrett said. "For those unfamiliar with Congresswoman Chisolm, it provides an opportunity to share about her significance."
As more women become involved in politics, they're "changing the narrative" of what a politician looks like, Ms. Garrett said. She credits former first lady Michelle Obama as a personal inspiration.
"To me, she is the trailblazer [for] why you see more women in politics making bold, bright statements with their clothing choices," she said.
Ms. Garrett typically wears blazers; some are more colorful, some more conservative. "I want to stand out so it helps people remember who you are and whom you represent."
She sees both sides of the argument over what politicians wear and whether it matters. What's also interesting to her is who does most of the commentary.
"Most of the criticism I see in the media comes from other women," she said. "I believe the definition of professional attire is changing."
Gisele Fetterman
When former Braddock Mayor John Fetterman was sworn in earlier this month as Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, his wife saw it as an opportunity to tell the story of her own journey from undocumented immigrant from Brazil to a U.S. citizen and the state's second lady. She commissioned a custom-made pin by Studebaker Metals, a metalsmith company in Braddock, that read "Immigrant."
"I'm not sure if a formerly undocumented person ever stood on that stage before, but I sure hope others stand there again," she said.
Even before her husband's political rise, Ms. Fetterman said she was thoughtful about her fashion choices.
"I'm usually overdressed, if that's possible. Part of it has been compensating for John's casual style," she said.
When he was Braddock's mayor, Mr. Fetterman often appeared in shorts and short-sleeved shirts that showed his tattoos. For his inauguration in Harrisburg, he wore a suit and tie.
Ms. Fetterman's personal style also is a way for her to convey her social and economic values.
"One of the papers asked if they could interview the designer of my inaugural dress. I said they would have to call the mall because it was a 70 percent clearance markdown at Macy's," she said. "I love accessible and affordable clothes."
When it comes to discussing what people in politics wear, she recognizes that it comes with the territory.
"As long as the discussing and analyzing does not lead to policing," she said.

Texto completo: Louisiana Shooting Leaves Five Dead

New Orleans (ap) — Authorities in Louisiana said separate but related shootings on Saturday in two different parishes have left five people dead, and they’re searching for a 21-year-old man who they said is “armed and dangerous.”
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the “prime suspect” in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
They were shot in their trailer on Saturday morning. Deputies arrived at the scene and were able to interview one of the victims before both died. Webre said that information led authorities to zero in on the couple’s son as a suspect.
Dakota Theriot was being sought on first-degree murder and other charges. He was believed to be driving a stolen 2004 Dodge Ram pickup, gray and silver in color.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred on Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
Iowa Rep. King Applauded At First Event Since House Rebuke
Primghar, Iowa (ap) — Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman’s first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn’t adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he’s not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
12 Immigrant Workers at Trump Golf Course Fired, Lawyer Says
New York (ap) — A dozen immigrant workers at one of President Donald Trump’s golf clubs in New York who are in the U.S. illegally were fired this month, even though managers knew about their legal status for years, a lawyer for the workers said on Saturday.
As the president railed against immigrants coming into the country illegally during the government shutdown, a manager at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County called a dozen immigrant workers into a room, one by one, Jan. 18 and fired them, said lawyer Anibal Romero.
Many of them had worked at the club for a dozen or more years, he said, and managers knew they had submitted phony documents but looked the other way.
The firings come after workers at another Trump club in New Jersey came forward last month to say managers there had hired them knowing they were in the country illegally, and had even helped one obtain phony documents.
Canadian AmbassadorTo China Dismissed

Ottawa, Ontario (Bloomberg) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ousted his ambassador to China in the middle of a diplomatic feud with Beijing after a string of public remarks drew criticism.
Trudeau asked for, and got, the resignation of John McCallum on Friday, according to a statement from his office issued Saturday. The ousting came during the fallout from Canada’s arrest in December of Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the U.S., which has angered China.
China has since seized two Canadians and sentenced a third to death.
Trudeau’s announcement of McCallum’s departure did not mention the controversy.

Spanish Toddler Who Fell Down Well Found Dead

Andalusia, Spain (Washington Post) — In the predawn hours of Saturday morning, a gargantuan search-and-rescue operation in Spain came to a tragic end as workers discovered the body of Julen Rosello, a 2-year-old boy who had fallen more than 30 stories down a narrow borehole nearly two weeks ago.
“At 1:25 a.m., Julen was found dead, unfortunately,” Alfonso Rodríguez, a government representative in Andalusia, told reporters later, his eyes brimming with tears as he gave details of the discovery.
Julen had been found by two miners and an officer on duty from the national Civil Guard. The toddler’s body was retrieved from the hole at 4 a.m., Rodriguez said.
Julen’s fate had captivated the country ever since Jan. 13, when he had tumbled into a narrow, unmarked hole — 15 inches at its widest spot — that had been drilled for a possible well on private property in Totalan, a small town on the southern coast of Spain.
Taking Tune From ‘The Office,’ Man Helps Save Woman’s Life
Tucson, Ariz. (ap) — A classic scene from a decade-old episode of The Office helped an Arizona mechanic save an unconscious woman’s life.
The Arizona Daily Star reported that 21-year-old Cross Scott found a woman locked in her car this month and broke in, finding she wasn’t breathing.
He doesn’t have any emergency training, but thought of the show where Steve Carell’s character does CPR to the tune of the Bee Gees’ song Stayin’ Alive. The song has the correct tempo for chest compressions.
Within a minute, the woman was breathing, and she was taken to a hospital and later released.
Scott, who shares the last name of Carell’s character, Michael Scott, had help from two women who also stopped when they saw the car and called 911.

Texto completo: The author of a book that led a British newspaper to issue an apology and pay “substantial damages" to first lady Melania Trump is standing behind her reporting.

Nina Burleigh authored the cover story “The mystery of Melania,” which appeared in The Daily Telegraph’s Jan. 19 magazine and was adapted from her October 2018 book Golden Handcuffs: The Secret History of Trump’s Women.

“The book was lawyered for months and fact checked professionally, it does not contain inaccuracies and there is nothing false in it,” Burleigh said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “ It was excerpted in Newsweek, Yahoo and on Bustle and was covered in the New York Times, New York Magazine, and People magazine and in the UK in The Daily Mail, to name just a few of the print and online outlets, as well as discussed on numerous podcasts, radio and TV, including several times on the BBC."

“Melania Trump never challenged it in the three months since it was published here,” Burleigh said of her book. “I understand it’s easier to use British law to silence criticism and shut down inquiry. I stand by the accuracy of my reporting.”

The Telegraph on Saturday issued an apology to Trump regarding Burleigh’s cover story and said it agreed to pay the first lady “substantial damages," as well as her legal costs. The story was removed from The Telegraph’s website and from others that reproduced the piece.

“We apologise unreservedly to The First Lady and her family for any embarrassment caused by our publication of these allegations,” The Telegraph said.

The newspaper said the article contained “a number of false statements which we accept should not have been published,” including that Trump cried on the night of the 2016 presidential election.

That claim was initially reported in Michael Wolff’s tell-all book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House , published last year.

Burleigh also said on Twitter the reporting in her book was accurate and said she hasn’t been asked for money.

“[B]ut I’d donate to a Trump hush money slush fund before apologizing to the family’s pet sharks for writing true things,” she tweeted Saturday.

Ashton: I got to play with a cash register and fondle yarn and then my retail job took a turn for the worse

Texto completo: So, I recently got a job in retail. It was my first such experience, unless you count the year I worked at a frozen yogurt shop when I was 15, which I’m not sure counts.
For most of the rest of my life, I’ve been a writer (and for a bit an Uber driver). I make my own schedule. I’ve never clocked in or clocked out, and I soon realized that I’ve become accustomed to this flexibility.
The new job was at a yarn shop, which I figured would be the best way to offset the huge amount of money I personally spend on yarn. I asked if they could pay me in yarn, but they just looked at me quizzically, as if yarn weren’t a valid form of currency.
The first few days were spent on training, and I have to tell you, I love cash registers. It was like I was 10 years old playing with a toy.
The woman training me was all, “So, this is how you log in, and then this is how you ring stuff up.”
As I pressed the buttons, I literally said, “Boop beep boop beep boop beep.” And then when the cash drawer sprang open, I had to stop myself from clapping my hands.
My trainer looked at me as if I didn’t get out much. I took offense. I mean, it’s true, but she doesn’t know that, and I resented the assumption.
By the way, she also said that she was happy to have me on the team, because she was tired of being the only old one with kids. Which, strangely, I didn’t take offense at. Because I was ringing people up and running credit cards and winding yarn. I was living the dream. And I got to say, “boop beep boop beep boop beep,” which I didn’t learn in training, but it was an extra thing I added all by myself.
I scanned barcodes and remarked, “Isn’t technology cool?” The cash register would do all the math, and if someone paid in dollar bills, it would tell me how much change to give.
I also got to touch yarn all day, and someone was actually paying me to do it.
And then came something bad. Nay, nefarious. Nay, the dark shadow of the hulking silhouette of something nefarious.
It was called … inventory.
We do it once a quarter. It involves counting stuff on the floor, and then counting stuff in the claustrophobic attic, and then comparing it to a printed sheet of how many stuffs we’re supposed to have.
I know, it sounds easy. But in reality, it’s sweaty, dirty, impossible work.
I did a lot of counting. A lot.
Usually I came up with the right number. Sometimes I was off by one or two. But one time, I confused the color oyster with osprey, and I was off by a lot.
It sounds like an obvious mistake. But trust me, if you’ve spent hours and hours counting and counting, and going over colors with names like ravelry red and cinnamon red and regular red and irregular red, it can be hard to keep track of everything.
Management found my mistake. I was summoned to the attic for a good old-fashioned talking to.
I apologized and attributed the mistake to my obvious extreme old age, and all of the kids I’ve birthed who have sucked my brain cells dry, and my eyesight, which is probably suffering from cataracts.
My trainer, who is literally half my age, said, “So, for every number that’s off, why don’t you recount? It will make good practice.”
She then assigned me to count notions, which were “everywhere, and nowhere, and maybe in the space-time vortex, and you have to find them yourself and decode the code names and you’ll never succeed and you suck.” I’m pretty sure that’s what she said, word for word.
To make a long story short, I am no longer working in retail. Probably much to everyone’s satisfaction, shoppers and management alike.
But I did enjoy clocking in and clocking out. So I’m applying that to my role as a mom. When my kid says, “Can you make me spaghetti?” I can simply respond, “Sorry, I’m off the clock.”

'Trump is having an impact': NATO head credits president's tough talk for $100B boost

Resumen: Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said Trump is helping the alliance adapt to "a more unpredictable world."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump "is committed to NATO" and deserves credit in obtaining $100 billion more in defense spending for the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said Sunday.
"President Trump has been very clear: He is committed to NATO. He stated that clearly just a few days ago and also at the NATO summit in July," Stoltenberg said on "Fox News Sunday. "
Stoltenberg's comment stands in contrast to Democrats who fear Trump wants to pull out of NATO, and some who have expressed concern he could be undermining the military alliance because it benefits Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A New York Times report earlier this month said Trump repeatedly told aides he wanted to pull out of the alliance. In response to the report, Democrats pushed for legislation requiring congressional approval of any move to leave NATO.
Trump has also been criticized for his aggressive approach in insisting America's "delinquent" allies pay a greater share toward the collective defense agreement. At the summit in July, he demanded the other members "immediately" increase their contributions.
Stoltenberg said the tough approach paid off.
"We agreed to do more to step up – and now we see the results. By the end of next year, NATO allies will add $100 billion extra toward defense," he said. "So we see some real money and some real results. And we see that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact. "
The president took note of Stoltenberg's interview.
"Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline," Trump tweeted. "It’s called burden sharing. Also, more united. "
The president also said Stoltenberg's interview undermined the narrative from "Dems & Fake News" who "like to portray the opposite" of his relationship with NATO.
When asked if he was concerned that Trump was "helping Putin splinter NATO," Stoltenberg said, "What I see is that actually NATO is united because we are able to adapt to deliver. North America and Europe are doing more together now than before. "
Stoltenberg said Trump is helping "us adapt the alliance, which we need, because we live in a more unpredictable world. "
"And you have to remember that the increase we now see in defense spending by European and NATO allies comes after years of decline. So before they were cutting billions. Now they're actually adding billions," he said.

Texto completo: PRIMGHAR, Iowa - Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in The New York Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said.
Trudeau fires envoy to China over U.S. extradition remarks
TORONTO - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired Canada's ambassador to China after the envoy said it would be "great" if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for a Chinese tech executive arrested in Canada. Trudeau said Saturday he had asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation Friday night.
McCallum made the remark Friday to the Toronto Star. That came a day after he issued a statement saying he misspoke about the case earlier and regretted saying Meng Wanzhou has a strong case against extradition.
The arrest of the daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Ltd. at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 damaged relations between China and Canada. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
U.S. envoy points to 'significant progress' in talks with Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan said Saturday that "significant progress" was made during lengthy talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that he was traveling to Afghanistan for more discussions aimed at ending the country's 17-year war.
Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he wants to build on six days of meetings in Doha.
Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have reached an understanding on the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops and that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks or threats against other countries.
There was also no indication that the Taliban would agree to a cease-fireor when the Taliban would hold direct talks with the Afghan government, something they have continued to reject.
Manhunt underway for suspect in 5 related killings in Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS - Authorities in Louisiana say separate but related shootings Saturday in two parishes have left five people dead, and they're searching for a 21-year-old man they say is "armed and dangerous."
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the "prime suspect" in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
"We feel that they are related," Webre said.
Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard identified the victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Summer Ernest, 20, and Tanner Ernest, 17. Two children fled. A neighbor said Theriot was the older daughter's boyfriend.
Merkel calls on each citizen to fight anti-Semitism
BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on every citizen to help fight anti-Semitism ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Merkel said Saturday in her weekly podcast: "Today we are seeing a very different kind of anti-Semitism: there's the hatred of Jews by our local people, but also by Muslim migrants."
In recent years, Germany has seen a rising number of attacks against Jews that led the government to appoint a commissioner against anti-Semitism. It's also funding the creation of a national registration office for anti-Semitic hate crimes.
On Sunday, Germany and other countries will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day - 75 years after the Soviet army liberated the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
Death toll rises to 40
in collapse at Brazil mine
BRUMADINHO, Brazil - The death toll from the collapse of a dam holding back mine waste in southeastern Brazil rose to 40 Saturday as searchers in helicopters and rescuers laboring in deep mud uncovered more bodies. More than 200 people were still missing and authorities expected the death toll to rise.
Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, warned that those responsible "would be punished."
Daily Folha de S.Paulo reported Saturday that the dam's mining complex, owned and operated by Brazilian mining company Vale, was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to "decreased risk."
Preservation groups in the area say the approval was unlawful.
In addition to the 40 bodies recovered, 23 people were hospitalized.
In Mexico: The death toll from a pipeline explosion last week in Tlahuelilpan, a town in central Mexico, has risen to 114, while 33 people remain hospitalized. Hundreds of people were in the vicinity of an illegal pipeline tap that spewed gasoline in the town Jan. 18 when the liquid caught fire and exploded into a fireball.
In France: The yellow vest movement kept pressure on President Emmanuel Macron with mainly peaceful marches and scattered skirmishes Saturday, its 11th straight weekend. Protests took place in Paris and other cities, centered on Macron policies seen as favoring the rich. France deployed 80,000 police officers.

Texto completo: Sy Oliver, who was born on Dec. 17, 1910, in Battle Creek, Michigan, (one article lists Dec. 10), moved to Zanesville at the age of 2, living with his family on Cliffwood Avenue.
Both of his parents were musicians. According to a Wikipedia article, "His mother was a piano teacher and his father was a multi-instrumentalist who made a name for himself demonstrating saxophones at a time that instrument was little used outside of marching bands."
In a Times Recorder article dated June 1, 1988, local historian Norris F. Schneider explained the nickname "Sy" was given to Oliver by high school classmates because of his interest in psychology. His actual name was Melvin James Oliver.
The same news story added: "He attended the old Columbia grade school and Grover Cleveland Junior High and was a carrier for the Times Recorder. He graduated from (Lash) high school in 1928."
A Feb. 26, 1949, TR article indicated he was a well-rounded student: "Oliver is a strong believer in education, sports and all the arts. He was a track record breaker at Zanesville high and still made the upper five percent in marks."
While still in high school he played trumpet with Cliff Barnett's Club Royal Serenaders, and at the age of 17 left home to join Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels, where he began receiving recognition as an arranger. Later he became a member of the Cincinnati-based Alphonso Trent Band.
In 1933 Oliver joined the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. Besides being one of the main solo trumpeters, his composing and arranging skills helped make the band financially successful and popular.
An article in the New York Times dated May 28, 1988, stated: "Mr. Oliver's arrangements were at the core of the band's repertory. Such Oliver compositions as "For Dancers Only," "Dream of You," "Organ Grinder Swing," "Stomp It Off" and "Taint What You Do" helped define the orchestra, and they remain some of jazz's finest arrangements and compositions."
After six years with the Lunceford Orchestra he joined the Tommy Dorsey Band as an arranger. According to a TR article from June 1988, "He arranged for Tommy Dorsey from 1939 through the late 1940s, using a powerful two-beat style. Oliver is ranked with Fletcher Henderson among the era's top arrangers. His works included "Opus I," ... "Easy Does It," "Swing High," ... and "Yes Indeed."
Between 1943 and 1945 Oliver led an Army band. With his own band he hosted a radio show, "Endorsed by Dorsey."
Oliver is credited with transitioning the Dorsey Band from Dixieland to an extremely popular big band sound. His arrangement of "On the Sunny Side of the Street" was a mega-hit for Tommy Dorsey.
For several years he served as a musical director for several record companies. A TR article dated Feb. 26, 1949, stated: "Melvin 'Sy' Oliver, Zanesville born and reared and now residing in the city, has been named musical director for Decca records. The firm has among its recording talent such stars as Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters." At the time of this announcement he was staying in Zanesville while his mother, Mrs. Oscar Loggins, underwent surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital.
Beginning in the late 1950s, he served as a freelance arranger for such stars as the Mills Brothers, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Ethel Merman, the Andrews Sisters, Louis Armstrong, Jo Stafford and Peggy Lee.
During the next several years he wrote scores for numerous TV shows and recorded several albums as he continued to arrange, compose and occasionally to perform. During the 1970s his band had two long engagements at the New York City's Rainbow Room.
His last performance in Zanesville occurred in the summer of 1973: "The Zane's Trace Commemoration has now gone down in history, with Zanesville's own Sy Oliver and his orchestra capping the three-day spectacle with a dance at Lind Arena last night."
A TR article featured a photograph of Oliver with the following caption: "Sy Oliver is shown pausing Sunday evening as his band of musical merrymakers play the final notes to a truly unforgettable weekend. Almost 500 people jammed into Lind Arena to hear Oliver's melodious melodies and most danced away the night as the sounds of the Thirties and Forties rippled through the hall."
His obituary was printed in the TR. It stated, in part: "Jazz composer-arranger-band leader Sy Oliver, one of the big band era's most influential and imitated arrangers, died Friday (May 28,1988) at Mt. Sinai Hospital of lung cancer. He was 77." Oliver was survived by his wife, Lillian Clark Oliver, and by two sons, Jeffrey and Taylor.
Lewis LeMaster is a retired teacher of the Zanesville area.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: A Trump critic leaves the field -- for now

Texto completo: One of the more important voices in the world of religious conservativism is leaving the field. At least for now.
Last week, Mark DeMoss quietly announced that he would soon close his boutique public relations firm in Buckhead, which for 28 years has told the stories of dozens of A-list conservative Christian clients.
Donald Trump isn't the reason he's calling it quits.
But it's fair to say that, for the last three years, DeMoss has exemplified one-half of the schism that has erupted within the evangelical community over a president whose personal language, conduct and history aren't endorsed by anything in the New Testament.
"My wife says I'm done with politics. And I love her enough to listen to that. I have mixed feelings about politics. There's a side of it I like, and increasingly, there's more that I hate," said DeMoss, a spare figure in a glass office. "I have a lot of concerns about where things are politically with the church and evangelicals."
"You're seeing a lot of what I would consider voices of reason being run out of the Congress and run out of government -- and certainly run out of the Republican Party," DeMoss said.
DeMoss' three-decade career has spanned the rise of religious conservative influence within the Republican Party. He has served as counselor to American evangelism's two most famous father-son teams: the Falwells and the Grahams.
Straight out of Liberty University in 1984, DeMoss became chief of staff to the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., founder of the Moral Majority, which had already helped push Ronald Reagan into the White House.
You have seen DeMoss at work, though you may not know it. In 2017, when the Museum of the Bible opened in Washington, D.C., DeMoss was in charge of the details. When the Rev. Billy Graham died last year, the official announcement came through DeMoss' office on Peachtree Road. The Atlanta publicist has continued to work with Franklin Graham.
More significantly, when Mitt Romney sought the GOP nomination for president -- in vain in 2008 but successfully in 2012 -- DeMoss served as his liaison to an evangelical community suspicious of the candidate's Mormon faith. DeMoss urged his colleagues to look past Romney's religion and judge him by his values.
But in 2016, Trump was a bridge too far. DeMoss held a prominent post on the governing board of his alma mater, Liberty University, whose president was Jerry Falwell Jr.
The university president gave a full-throated endorsement of Trump during the GOP presidential primary. In an interview with The Washington Post, DeMoss was critical of the front-running Trump, saying the candidate was a rejection of all that the university stood for.
In the end, DeMoss resigned from the board.
As a traditional Baptist, DeMoss takes our constitutional ban on religious tests for public office quite seriously. On an office wall in his 20-person firm hangs a copy of a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times a few years ago. The headline: "Burning the Qur'an does not illuminate the Bible."
But to DeMoss, it is Romney and Trump -- the latter is nominally a member of a traditional Christian denomination -- who best illuminate the current split within the evangelical world.
"What we evangelicals preached for the last 40 years really got tested with a Mitt Romney nomination. Do we, in fact, believe that family values and character and integrity matter most? And do they matter more than a candidate who shares your faith or theology?" DeMoss asked. "I'm more interested in a candidate that shares my values."
Suffice it to say that DeMoss was present in Washington this month when Romney was sworn in as the newest U.S. senator from Utah.
DeMoss would like you to know that he isn't closing his shop out of weakness. His public qualms about Trump haven't hurt his firm, which had a solid 2018. Nor is his health an issue.
A 2017 bout with cancer is in remission, but the fight did require him to focus on the basics. "I love the practice of PR. I don't even like the business of PR. I love giving advice, navigating a crisis, solving a problem, shaping a message. I don't love ownership and chasing a client," he said.
DeMoss is quite blunt about what he'll do next. "The short, immediate answer is that I honestly don't know," he said.
But he is concerned about where his world and his friends are headed. I asked DeMoss to describe the arc of the movement he helped propel.
From the early '80s, he said, he watched Falwell Sr. transform from a preacher who counseled against involvement in politics to one who encouraged Christians to dive in. "Then I watched him and countless other religious conservatives preach that our loyalties should be not to a party, but to values," DeMoss said.
Think Bill Clinton.
"Now what I think what we're seeing, in a big way, is an increasing loyalty to a party -- even if it means dispensing with certain values," DeMoss said.
"Pragmatism" was the polite description that he gave the willingness among some evangelicals to trade U.S. Supreme Court appointments for a set of blinders.
"I think there have been a lot of trade-offs that we will look back on someday and say, 'That was too high a price,'" DeMoss said.
In the meantime, DeMoss said, it's important to know that polarized politics in America doesn't just mean Democrat vs. Republican, or liberal vs. conservative.
No matter what the polls say, evangelicals are divided, too.
"I have pastor friends that had long, close relationships that have been really hurt and damaged," he said.
But DeMoss believes in the political cycle and the pendulum of civic forces. There is still time for the situation to right itself.
DeMoss will close his firm's doors in March. Perhaps by September, he'll know what comes next. The betting here is that we'll see him again.

Texto completo: Jonas Mekas did many things in his long life, but one thing he did better than almost anyone -- the last thing he did -- was model how to live as a vital New Yorker at age 95. That came to an end this week at 96, as Jonas died in his home, after months of treatment for a debilitating blood disorder. His death was peaceful, according to his son, Sebastian, as was his mind during the four years that I knew him.
"My own end will come when it's ready to come, but I never think about that," he told me in June of 2015, in his loft in Brooklyn. "I could drop next second. It's useless to think about that. You never know. You cannot protect yourself from death.
"I grew up with no radio, no electricity, no television, no music, no phonographs. I saw my first movie when I was 14. One could live to 200. But yet I see some young people, 20 years old, and they seem to be bored already with life, and some of them cannot stand it. That's something else."
Wednesday night, when I spoke at a bookstore about spending a year following Jonas and five other New Yorkers age 85 and up, I began with something he said in a Greenwich Village jazz club.
"Have you ever thought about how amazing, really amazing, life is?"
Jonas was 92 at the time, reading from an unpublished novella called "Requiem for a Manual Typewriter." I was in the back, at a table of Lithuanian opera singers. Had I ever thought about life that way? Probably a couple of times over the years.
But by this time I had been following Jonas for three months, and I realized that that was how he saw life all the time. Maybe not when he was younger, when he was put in a series of Nazi forced labor camps and then United Nations displaced persons camps, but Jonas was still growing, and when we last talked, on New Year's Day, he was still amazed by his journey.
His only problem, he said, was that he had developed acid reflux, which meant he no longer enjoyed his food.
Jonas loved his food.
And his wine.
I never knew the Jonas Mekas who pioneered avant-garde film in America, befriended Andy Warhol and Yoko Ono, built Anthology Film Archives, created "diaristic" films that anticipated Instagram and Facebook and stood as one of Lithuania's premier poets. But I knew the Jonas he added on top of all those other identities.
I love writing about that Jonas, who said things like:
"I'm very, very open to possibilities, not forgetting any dream of myself. I'm open always to what's coming. Farmers cultivate different things. I cultivate poetry and the saints, history, beauty, art. That's what I chose."
And: "You have to trust your angels."
And I recently learned, from an interview that he recorded for the National Holocaust Memorial Museum, that the proper pronunciation of his last name was not MEEK-us, as the people who didn't know him said, or MECK-us, as those who considered ourselves in the know said, but MACK-us. Who knew?
Strange relationship. Somebody you know dies, you think about all your old conversations. What did you both say, really? But with Jonas all my conversations are recorded and transcribed, searchable. What did he say about wine? Oh, yeah, from an email dated Dec. 15, 2016:
"What keeps you young? they ask me. And I say, it's wine, women and song. But at the same time I am a monk, I live like a monk."
So his death is different. It's not loss, because our conversations are still there; it's a door closed on future gain -- the talks we will not have, the guidance he will not give. The magnitude of this change is a measure of the man at 96.
We were not friends. Jonas had a close inner circle but was remarkable for being present to countless outer circles. On the other hand, he did not distinguish between work and life. I was documenting a part of his life that a real biographer would condense or skip, his life after he had done all the things that made him a subject for biography.
But what a life.
You see this photo?
That's Madame Blavatsky, the 19th-century Russian theosophist. Jonas brought out that photo in December 2017 to explain something: when he saw Greta Gerwig in New York magazine, he thought, aha, same person!
"You cannot miss it," he said.
I don't see it, myself.
But as Jonas explained to a writer from The New York Review of Books, who accused him of distorting his past, some of the things he says, he says "poetically."
Jonas loved Gerwig's movie "Lady Bird." This year he was too tired to watch most of the DVDs sent to him for Oscar consideration. He was sure that would pass. His doctors were so good. He'd been dying since he was 7, when doctors told his parents that their sickly son would not live long (a story that rings apocryphal, but not for lack of repetition).
He would have died to see the obituaries calling him an "experimental" filmmaker.
"That's nonsense," he once scolded a young woman at a gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, who said she studied experimental film and was honored to meet him. Scientists experiment, he said. Filmmakers film, and the results are always film. "Creatives, those are my enemies. All the corporations and designers and billboards, they are my enemies."
That night, Jonas delivered a critique of the art world while wearing a rubber mask of a dog's head. He was not angry enough for such a critique himself, he told the audience, so he had to channel an angry dog.
He'd done the angry dog before. People loved it.
Jonas often insisted that he came to the United States at age 27, even though he was actually 26, and he held firm even after I showed him that the dates didn't back him up. Poetically he was 27.
I worked all my life to become young --
no, you can't persuade me to get old
I will die twenty seven ---
(from an unpublished poem)
It had something to do with Joseph Conrad's novella "The Shadow-Line," and everything to do with the poetry of being Jonas Mekas.
The last time I asked him about being 27 was at Anthology Film Archives in October, when we spoke at a conference called "Reimagine End of Life," so death was prominent in our conversation.
Jonas had recently come out of the hospital, which at his age made the topic especially concrete. The conversation felt like one of our interviews, but with 150 or so of his fans hanging on his every word.
Did he feel an urgency to finish projects?
He did not, he said. There was just work, as always.
"The doctors told me, Do you know that you are very sick?" he said. "Yes. So I know that I am very sick, and when one is very sick, it can be next minute. But that's O.K. I think I had my share, 95. Thanks to the angels, I'm very happy. I'm lucky. I trust them completely. If they tell me to finish what I'm doing, I will finish it. "
About his own end he brought up his rural childhood and said: "On a farm you watch the animals die so you can eat. So it's not anything very special. It's part of the cycle. I never think about it. I'm doing things that interest me. But that I accept as fact. I know we all die and it's normal. Why think about it? Why worry about it?"
His last major project was to raise money to build a cafe and library for Anthology Film Archives, to secure its financial survival. Each year he raised a few million, and each year the price tag rose by a slightly bigger sum. And each year he projected success in the coming months.
Maybe this year. The building could bear his name. It would be poetic.
Because have you ever thought about how amazing, really amazing, life is?

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

How the Dems came to love ‘co-equal’

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
Now, Democrats have been saying it every day. There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president.
But that doesn’t make it true.

Texto completo: OUR MOVIE RATINGS: * Skip it; **So-so; ***Good; **** Excellent
'Aquaman' **
PG-13 - 2:22 - Jason Momoa's charisma is as formidable as his brawn, but this movie about the long-haired, shirtless superhero is soggy with Atlantis mythology and drowns in special effects. Associated Press
'Bohemian Rhapsody' **½
PG-13 - 2:15 - As Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek delivers a committed, thoroughly inhabited performance, which winds up transcending the regrettably thin material at hand. Washington Post
'Bumblebee' ***
PG-13 - 1:53 - While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save "Transformers." This charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot flips the script on the tired, bloated franchise. Associated Press
'Creed II' **½
PG-13 - 2:08 - In this superior "Rocky" sequel, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), son of the late Apollo, sets out to avenge his father's death in the boxing ring. Also starring Sylvester Stallone. Chicago Tribune
'Destroyer' **½
R - 2:03 - A barely recognizable Nicole Kidman stars as a terrible cop in a terrible cop movie. Director Karyn Kusama, originally from St. Louis, keeps the pace slow and our interest fairly low. Daniel Neman
'Dr. Seuss'
The Grinch' **½
PG - 1:30 - Benedict Cumberbatch voices the green Christmas grouch in this adaptation (the third) of Dr. Seuss' 1957 children's book. This computer-animated version is beautiful to look at, but the new material doesn't resonate. Tribune News Service
'Escape Room'
PG-13 - 1:40 - Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control and must use their wits to find the clues or die. Directed by Adam Robitel. Not reviewed.
'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' ***
PG-13 - 2:14 - The nifflers are cute. But there's something far less adorable that has also escaped in this Harry Potter prequel, which takes a turn for the dark side that will satisfy adult fans. Washington Post
'The Favourite' ***½
R - 2:01 - Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play a pair of women sucking up to England's Queen Anne in the 18th century. You'd swear they have paid staffs of comedy writers hidden beneath their voluminous skirts. Star Tribune
'Glass' **
PG-13 - 2:09 - Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan reminds us he is the ultimate mastermind, the king of the twists. But the true master at work is James McAvoy, who reprises his role from "Split." Tribune News Service
'Green Book' ***½
PG-13 - 2:10 - Movie based on a true story recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx-bred Italian-American (Viggo Mortensen) was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to concert engagements across the Deep South. Directed by Peter Farrelly. Associated Press
'The House With a Clock in Its Walls' Zero stars
PG - 1:39 - Supernatural thriller manages to find the perfect un-sweet spot -- it's too scary for little kids, not scary enough for older ones, not funny or clever enough for their parents, and too redundant for everyone. Associated Press
'If Beale Street Could Talk' ***½
R - 1:59 - Director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") delivers a heartbreaking story of obstacles and injustices in 1970s Harlem. Associated Press
'Instant Family' **½
PG-13 - 2:00 - Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a couple who are unable to conceive children of their own and who choose to adopt -- not just one child, but three siblings. Based on co-writer/director Sean Anders' own experience. Washington Post
'Mary Poppins Returns' *½
PG - 1:11 - Disney's sequel starring Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda works hard to evoke the undeniable charms of the original 1964 film, but without the spoonful of sugar to help it all go down. Directed by Rob Marshall. Washington Post
'Mary Queen of Scots' **
R - 1:57 - The story of the conflicted relationship between Mary, the queen of Scotland (Saoirse Ronan), and her cousin Elizabeth, queen of England (Margot Robbie), has been told many times. This version succeeds only in conveying the most basic elements of their story. Daniel Neman
'Mortal Engines'
PG-13 - 2:08 - Centuries after civilization collapsed, an enigmatic woman, an outcast and an outlaw unite to try to stop London, now a dangerous metropolis on wheels. With Hugo Weaving, Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Jihae. Written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson. Directed by Christian Rivers. Not reviewed. Los Angeles Times
'The Mule' *
R - 1:56 - The film is a fairly straightforward adaptation of a true story from the New York Times Magazine, but the racist cultural stereotypes and appalling treatment of women are all thanks to screenwriter Nick Schenk and director Clint Eastwood. Tribune News Service
'Night School' **½
PG-13 - 1:51 - Kevin Hart is funny as a night-school student in a class led by a shockingly violent teacher (Tiffany Haddish). But it's the group of beloved comic character actors surrounding them who carry the movie through its bumpy patches. Tribune News Service
'On the Basis of Sex' ***
PG-13 - 2:00 - Felicity Jones plays feminist icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an adoring biography that ends well before she's sworn in as a Supreme Court justice. The wonderful Armie Hammer plays her husband. Associated Press
'Ralph Breaks
the Internet' **½
PG - 1:54 - Having liberated arcade game characters in "Wreck-it Ralph" (2012), its sequel sends the hulking, big-fisted Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and the glitchy candy-colored racer Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) into that expansive internet. Associated Press
'Roma' ****
R - 2:15 - Masterful drama by Alfonso CuarÃ³n is based on his memories of growing up in a bourgeois Mexico City household in the 1970s, shot through with vivid sensory cues that pulse with delight, sensuality and sadness. Washington Post
'Second Act' **
PG-13 - 1:43 - In a mashup of "Working Girl" and "Maid in Manhattan," Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who's passed over for a promotion at a big-box store and lands an interview at a multinational cosmetics firm -- thanks to an impressive resume cooked up by her teenage godson. Good cast; nearly hopeless script. Chicago Tribune
'Shoplifters' ****
R - 2:01 - The impoverished but happy Shibata family survives by stealing from Tokyo grocery stores. When they find a tiny girl, shivering and neglected, they take her, too. As filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda slowly and deliberately reveals, much of this isn't quite what it seems. Seattle Times
'Smallfoot' **½
PG - 1:36 - In a reverse-Bigfoot tale, a happy-go-lucky Himalayan Yeti (voiced by Channing Tatum) finds evidence of humans. It's predictable, but the journey is worth watching. Tribune News Service
'Spider-Man: Into
the Spider-Verse' ****
PG - 2:00 - A biracial kid (voiced by Shameik Moore) takes up a legendary superhero mantle in this multidimensional mind-trip from Sony Pictures Animation. The seventh Spider-Man movie to hit the big screen feels more like a one-of-a-kind, wall-crawling experience. Washington Post
'A Star Is Born' ***½
R - 2:17 - Bradley Cooper makes his directorial debut with a lavishly delightful remake that stars Lady Gaga as an unknown singer who becomes a pop sensation. Washington Post
'The Upside' One-half star
PG-13 - 2:06 - A lazy, skirt-chasing ex-con (Kevin Hart) accidentally gets a job taking care of a wealthy businessman who became a paraplegic (Bryan Cranston). It's based on a true story, but it's predictable and lacking in drama and laugh-out-loud moments. Associated Press
'Vice' *½
R - 2:12 - Christian Bale nails it as Dick Cheney, plotting his rise from a misdirected young man in Wyoming to one of the most notorious gray eminences in American politics. But the rest of the movie, written and directed by Adam McKay, is an absurd mess. Washington Post
'Welcome to Marwen' **½
PG-13 - 1:56 - Steve Carell stars as a man who survived a vicious beating and turns to art -- creating strange and strangely moving dioramas -- as therapy. Based on a true, if fictionalized, story. Washington Post
'Widows' ***
R - 2:09 - Wives and girlfriends of criminals and mobsters are usually secondary characters. In Steve McQueen's thriller, they're in the spotlight. Viola Davis steals the show. Associated Press

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ANIMATION FIRST at the French Institute Alliance Française (Jan. 25-27). The French filmmaker Michel Ocelot has modestly compared himself to "an apple tree bearing apples." This festival, which features Ocelot as a guest of honor, presents a rare opportunity to taste some of his finest fruit. Celebrating French animation, the programs begin on Friday evening with Ocelot's "Kirikou and the Sorceress," inspired by African folklore, followed by an all-ages opening party. On Saturday the festival will also screen his "Ivan Tsarevitch and the Changing Princess," a fairy tale anthology. On Sunday children can enjoy Jacques Colombat's "Robinson & Compagnie" (a version of "Robinson Crusoe") and Alexandre Espigares's "White Fang," an adaptation of Jack London's novel that is dubbed in English. (The other films are in French with English subtitles.) Although not all the screenings are suitable for young audiences, the lineup offers several options for teenagers, as well as virtual-reality experiences and video games throughout the festival. (A full schedule is on the website.)

ARTSEE: PAPERCUTTING at the Museum at Eldridge Street (Jan. 27, 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m.). Artists don't draw with just pencils, pens and charcoal; some do it with blades. Housed within the landmark 19th-century Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, this museum is highlighting the work of one such expert in its exhibition "Releasing Words: The Cut Paper Art of Deborah Ugoretz." Geared toward children 5 and older, this workshop will begin with an examination of Ugoretz's technique, an age-old Jewish craft that she has used to create a kind of visual poetry. After considering her inspirations, which include Jewish texts and Pablo Neruda's verse, children will express their own tales and ideas in cut-paper art. (Space is limited, and reservations are required.)

'GENERATION NYZ' at La MaMa (Jan. 25, 26 and 31, 7 p.m.; Jan. 27, 3 p.m.; through Feb. 3). Growing up is rarely easy, but it can be especially hard on the gritty streets of New York. Conceived by Ping Chong and written by Sara Zatz and Kirya Traber in collaboration with the cast, this 75-minute play tells the stories of its seven young performers, all city residents ages 19 through 23. The production, which was commissioned last year by the New Victory Theater, grapples with issues like homelessness, sexuality, gender identity, immigration and domestic violence. Recommended for audiences 12 and older, it is a "gentle, humane, powerfully moving work of documentary theater," Laura Collins-Hughes, the New York Times reviewer, said in 2018. The actors, the creative team and local youth advocates will host post-show discussions on Saturday and Feb. 3; Ping Chong & Company will also offer a workshop about the production's creative methods on Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

KIDS 'N COMEDY: 'THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION SHOW' at Gotham Comedy Club (Jan. 27, 1 p.m.). Promising to face life with a sense of humor is always a good New Year's resolution, and it will be even easier to keep with the help of these talented young stand-ups. All tweens and teenagers, the comics here have studied with professional comedians and graduates of the Kids 'N Comedy programs, so they know how to make adolescence funny (even if it has never seemed that way to you). At this show, for audiences 9 and older, the group will tackle hopes and dreams for 2019 with cleverness but no crudeness. You can also buy lunch -- there's a kids' menu -- while enjoying the laughs.

MIL'S TRILLS NINTH ANNUAL WINTER BASH at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 27, 3-4 p.m.). Concerts presented by Amelia Robinson, a.k.a. Mil, are among the few at which children can expect to perform almost as much as the headliner. Robinson, who plays an electric ukulele and leads a band, habitually invites young listeners to bring their own instruments to her events. This time, though, the kids will do more than jam; working with 7- to 9-year-olds who have participated in her Musical Playdates web series, audience members will improvise original songs. Robinson's concerts are also unusual for offering the crowd a yoga warm-up; Bend & Bloom will do the honors on Sunday in Brooklyn.

'THE PAPER BAG PLAYERS: STAND UP AND CHEER, WE'RE 60 THIS YEAR!' at the Kaye Playhouse (Jan. 27, 2 p.m.). Elementary school students at a recent performance of this show needed no prompting to follow the directions in the title. Then again, the Paper Bag Players -- Ted Brackett, Marisa LaRuffa, Lily Emilia Smith, Kevin Richard Woodall and their composer and keyboard player, John Stone -- always encourage children to shout, jump, dance and sing during their hourlong musical revues. This latest celebrates their 60th anniversary with 12 vignettes in which the sets, props and sometimes even the characters are made of the troupe's signature paper and cardboard. (Jonathan Peck is the scenic designer.) The sketches include such classic hits as "The Cactus and the Balloon" and "Lost in the Mall," as well as inspired new works like "Shipwreck Island," in which a brave female pirate outwits bumbling men. Another fresh standout, "Mister Mix-Up," features a magician who puts ordinary things (e.g., a rain cloud, a hair bow) into a hat and extracts a lovely result (a rainbow). The piece captures this wonderful company's whole aesthetic: transforming the mundane into the marvelous.

SPOOKTACULAR: BONEYARD BOOGIE at the Queens Museum (Jan. 26, 2-4 p.m.). If you can have Christmas in July, why not Halloween in January? That's essentially what you can expect at this annual winter fund-raiser, which supports the museum's education department. Featuring designs by the artist and museum educator Gregory Corbino, the frolic will turn the building's second floor into a haunted cityscape inspired by the disco era. Children are encouraged to come in costume, ready to dance, bowl, make art, go on a scavenger hunt and play tick-tack-toe on a life-size board. The Circus Amok band and the Savvy Soul Line Dancers will also perform.

Texto completo: Each month, (at least) dozens of these stories are published — in The New Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, Outside, Texas Monthly, California Sunday, ProPublica, The New York Times, National Geographic and more. In fact, you could start today and read nothing but exceptional longform journalism for the rest of your life, without risking running out.
Now that we're more than three weeks into the new year, is it too late to come up with a resolution?
I mean — as I've stated before, I'm not really big on resolutions. In fact, I abhor them — as nature does a vacuum. And yet, year after year, I do find myself setting goals when the calendar changes, adjusting course, entertaining thoughts of doing more of this and less of that. I'm only human.
Last year, in an attempt to bring a little diversity to my reading list, I made a dedicated effort to not read any books by straight, white males. (I took some heat over that one, but stuck with it throughout 2018. I never regretted it for a moment.)
This year, I'm considering rekindling my longtime love affair with longform journalism.
It's unusual for me to make it this far into a year without starting a new book — yet I haven't.
And now, I'm seriously considering giving my nine six-foot bookshelves, replete with unread books, the year off. That's because the world is full of great, longform reporting. I don't know that I've ever mentioned it, but Thomas French's "Angels and Demons" — which earned French the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing — is an excellent example. The story, originally published by the St. Petersburg Times, weighs in at a hefty 54,000 words, which would take the average reader about four hours to read — and much longer to digest.
The story covers the manhunt for the person who killed Jo Rogers and her two daughters, found floating in Tampa Bay — a family from southern Ohio, murdered while visiting Florida on vacation.
Each month, (at least) dozens of these stories are published — in The New Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, Outside, Texas Monthly, California Sunday, ProPublica, The New York Times, National Geographic and more. In fact, you could start today and read nothing but exceptional longform journalism for the rest of your life, without risking running out.
There's Texas Monthly's piece on a specific Martin guitar — "serial number 242830" — better known as Willie Nelson's beloved "Trigger." There's Vanity Fair's story about a 2006 airline collision, 37,000 feet about the Amazon. And who could ever forget "What Bullets Do To Bodies," Jason Fagone's article for The Huffington Post in which he profiles trauma surgeons who all-too-regularly see the effects of gun violence. Or The Boston Globe's 2011 piece, "Whitey Bulger's Life in Exile."
And there are so many that I haven't read — like Gay Talese's "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold," ProPublica's "Blood Will Tell," and Michael Paterniti's story about the Khmer Rouge genocide for GQ. The list is literally endless.
Hundreds of these stories are waiting for me, unread, in my Pocket app. Thousands more are waiting to be read at Longform.org.
This year, I'm hoping to resist the temptation of all of those unread books and spend more time with my Kindle. The world is full of extraordinary storytelling; it's up to us to find it.

Texto completo: The Oscar nominations get all the attention, but Tuesday was a busy day for literary honors as well. Yale University awarded the $165,000 Bollingen Prize in American Poetry to Charles Bernstein, while the Mystery Writers of America announced their nominees for the annual Edgar Allan Poe Awards and the National Book Critics Circle named the finalists for their prestigious N.B.C.C. Awards.
The Bollingen Prize, administered through the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, is awarded every two years to recognize a recent book or a lifetime body of work. In choosing Bernstein as the 51st winner, this year's judges -- Ange Mlinko, Claudia Rankine and Evie Shockley -- said that throughout his career Bernstein "has shaped and questioned, defined and dismantled ideas and assumptions in order to reveal poetry's widest and most profound capabilities."
They singled out his most recent book, "Near/Miss," published in October by the University of Chicago Press, for particular praise.
"I am overwhelmed at being in the company of my fellow Bollingen winners," Bernstein said in a statement. "How great that 'Near/Miss' has been so warmly welcomed into the world."
Finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Awards include 31 books across six categories: autobiography, biography, criticism, fiction, nonfiction and poetry. Notably, the poet Terrance Hayes was nominated in two different categories for two different books. His collection "American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin" is a poetry finalist, and his book "To Float in the Space Between: A Life and Work in Conversation With the Life and Work of Etheridge Knight" is a finalist for criticism.
The 24 directors of the National Book Critics Circle typically name five finalists per category, but they cited an especially strong year for autobiography in naming six to that category this year. Those nominees include a graphic memoir (Nora Krug's "Belonging: A German Reckons With History and Home") and Tara Westover's "Educated," which The New York Times Book Review selected as one of its 10 Best Books of 2018.
The organization's lifetime achievement award will go to the independent publisher Arte Público Press, which specializes in Hispanic literature. The John Leonard Prize, for the best first book in any genre, will be awarded to Tommy Orange for his debut novel, "There There" (also one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books), which centers on a Native American gathering in Oakland, Calif. The NPR book critic Maureen Corrigan will receive a citation for excellence in reviewing.
The complete list of contenders across all six categories is here.
The awards will be presented on March 14 at the New School in New York City.
The Mystery Writers of America will present the Edgar Awards on April 25 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Prizes are awarded in 11 categories covering crime fiction, nonfiction and television. Finalists for best novel include Walter Mosley's "Down the River Unto the Sea" and Lawrence Osborne's "Only to Sleep," while Delia Owens is a finalist in the first novel category for "Where the Crawdads Sing" and Leila Slimani was nominated in the paperback category for another of the Book Review's 10 Best, "The Perfect Nanny."
The complete list of categories and nominees is here.

Trump deserves more credit for health policy improvements

Texto completo: The Trump administration is finally getting well-deserved credit, but still not enough, for its efforts to improve healthcare policy.

Even the liberal New York Times has published a column praising one of the improvements — one on which people of all ideological stripes should agree. Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent and now the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News, wrote on Jan. 21 in praise of Trump’s new order compelling hospitals to reveal publicly their master price lists.

Rosenthal acknowledges that the lists are complicated and full of obscure medical abbreviations that most patients won’t easily understand. Still, she writes, “don’t dismiss the lists as useless. Think of them as raw material to be mined for billing transparency and patient rights.”

And: “While the lists are far from user-friendly, researchers and entrepreneurs can now create apps to make it easier for patients to match procedures to their codes and crunch the numbers. With access to list prices on your phone, you could reject the $300 sling in the emergency room and instead order one for one-tenth of the price on Amazon.”

What also is likely is that once patients begin to make use of these rights to price transparency, they will use market pressure to demand that the lists become more comprehensible. And as that happens, demand for less expensive options surely will rein in the prices that prove needlessly exorbitant.

Rosenthal’s compliments for Trump’s action here are right on target. Even better, the price-transparency order is only one of several Trump administration actions that are making, or will make, healthcare more affordable, efficient, or available. For example, a Trump executive order reviving so-called “association health plans (AHPs)” already is seeing success in helping small businesses and individuals secure insurance coverage similar to option-filled plans offered by large corporations. Moreover, in at least partial fulfillment of a Trump campaign promise, the AHPs will be allowed to operate across state lines, thus giving even more leverage to insurance purchasers to find the best deals.

Trump also has used executive authority to expand access to short-term, limited-duration insurance, and health reimbursement arrangements. The name of the former is rather self-explanatory, with the result that less expensive plans will be available for consumers who don’t want or need all the bells and whistles mandates by Obamacare. The latter are defined as “tax-advantaged, account-based arrangements that employers can establish for employees to give employees more flexibility and choices regarding their healthcare.”

At least partly due to these policies and other Trump administration management changes, health insurance premiums in the past year leveled off after several straight years of outlandish increases, and in some categories even appear to be dropping. This welcome news comes as dozens more insurers, reacting to the new policies, are now offering plans on the federal exchanges, so consumers will have more options. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Last year, consumers in 56 percent of counties had only one carrier participating, CMS officials said, and next year that will drop to 39 percent.”

Yes, conservatives wisely want to repeal and replace Obamacare as a whole, expand health savings accounts, and encourage market reforms that do even more to expand choices and reduce prices. Until they do, though, the Trump administration is doing what it can to make the existing system more transparent, rational, and affordable. Kudos are due.

Nautilus CEO Bruce Cazenave, left, speaks with Amy Scharnhorst as she exercises on a StairMaster during her break on July 23, 2013, at Nautilus' headquarters

Nautilus Inc., just days removed from a precipitous plunge in its stock price, appeared to have found level ground Tuesday.
The Vancouver-based exercise equipment brand ended the day on the New York Stock Exchange at $6.86 per share.
While that was nearly 42 percent lower than its $11.79 closing price Thursday, it was just two-tenths of a percentage point below its opening price of $7.07 Tuesday morning, the week's first day of trading after markets were closed in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
One stock analyst believes the company's early warning could presage a challenging year for Nautilus. And a competitor called Peloton threatens the Nautilus bottom line.
The stock price drop-off followed Nautilus' pre-released fourth quarter and full-year results on Thursday that warned investors that earnings would fall below the company's previous predictions made in October.
Instead of annual revenue of $431 million to $440 million, profit of $42 million to $45 million, and earnings per share of $1.01, the company said to expect $395 million to $397 million in revenue; $20 million to $21 million in profit and 40 cents to 50 cents per share profit. Audited results are expected in late February.
The company said sales of $114 million to $116 million are expected for the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2017, the company reported fourth-quarter sales of $127.8 million.
In its release Thursday, the Nautilus statement said it “expected significantly stronger sales” in direct sales to consumers, “driven by the introduction of the new digital platform Max Intelligence. We expect that as consumers are further exposed to (Max Intelligence), this unique product will help to accelerate sales across a number of our products and brands in the future starting in 2019.”
Introduced in November in time for the holidays and New Year's resolutions, the Max platform is an app that costs $14.95 a month or $149 per year. It works in tandem with the Bowflex Max Trainer M6 and M8 cardio machines, offering personalized — yet computer generated — coaching tips based on past performance on the machine as well as other factors. The Max Trainer M6 costs about $1,699; the M8, $2,299.
In response to the company's announcement Thursday, asset manager D.A. Davidson & Co. lowered its rating from buy to neutral for Nautilus.
“We fear the initial 2019 guide that will be announced on the call in late February will most likely reflect a continuation of several of these trends,” says the research note Davidson analyst Michael Kawamoto issued last week.
“We are encouraged to hear that responses from people who have used the Max Intelligence platform have been positive overall,” Kawamoto wrote, “but the company's marketing efforts have not been resonating with consumers like Nautilus had expected.”
Breaking from the pack
In its annual report for 2017, Nautilus mentioned six principal competitors. But only one of those six set the exercise equipment world on its ear in 2018.
Peloton, the privately held company based in New York, broke from the pack in 2018.
The company announced in August a $550 million round of funding, for a total of $1 billion raised with a $4 billion valuation. Peloton has captured an audience with this lure: A consumer buys one of the company's $1,995 bikes then pays $39 a month for live video spin classes.
Also last year, the company began selling a treadmill called Peloton Tread for $3,995.
Peloton is on track to bring in $700 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in February, Jessica Kleiman, vice president of global communications for Peloton, told The New York Times. It plans to go public this year.
While Kawamoto says in his investor note that it's unclear why Nautilus' Max Intelligence did not immediately catch on with consumers, Peloton may play a role.
Nautilus “has a tough road ahead while they figure out a messaging strategy that can cut through the noise from Peloton,” Kawamoto wrote in an email Tuesday, “as well as fears from a slowing economy (hous

Will helping fix the teachers strike help Eric Garcetti become president?

Texto completo: In some potentially important ways, Eric Garcetti’s presidential hopes got a lift Tuesday morning when the Los Angeles mayor helped end the teachers strike in the nation’s second-largest school district.
But Garcetti’s role in the settlement between officials of Los Angeles Unified and the teachers union is hardly a springboard to the White House — and it might even have a downside, political observers said in interviews.
The pluses are clear for Garcetti, who is thought to be preparing to launch what would be a long-shot campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
First, it lends credence to the claim that a big-city mayor would make a good president because he or she has dealt with tangible problems. That’s a theme that might resonate well with voters frustrated by ideological battles and partisan standoffs in Washington, D.C., including the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
Also, to the extent that United Teachers Los Angeles is happy with the settlement, Garcetti’s involvement in the agreement might appeal to Democratic activists who generally support unions and teachers.
At the very least, the teachers’ likely return to work Wednesday after a nine-day strike clears the way for Garcetti to embark on a national campaign without being accused of ignoring a crisis at home.
“It plays into a message that the mayor is someone who brings people together and gets the job done,” said Jeffrey Hernandez, a political science professor at East L.A. College. “The only negative is if people felt it (the strike) went on too long. I don’t see that happening. It wasn’t really his ballgame (when the strike started).”
“Voters sometimes look for a contrast with the current incumbent,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the election forecasting site run by University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. “An accomplished manager (of a major city) would present a nice contrast with the current president (Donald Trump).”
But analysts saw reasons that Garcetti’s star turn Tuesday morning — standing at a City Hall lectern and announcing the strike settlement following all-night talks — won’t instantly turn his image from mayoral to presidential:
• The more that Garcetti supporters portray the settlement as a major problem solved by the 47-year-old second-term mayor, the more opponents will point to other problems that remain unsolved, most notably the L.A. homelessness crisis. Garcetti was instrumental in passing city and county ballot measures to fund anti-homelessness projects, but the effects are years away. (The same goes for Garcetti’s successes in passing mass-transit ballot measures and bringing the 2028 Summer Olympics to L.A.)
“It was a big coup for him to get that stage,” said California Republican Party treasurer and former Downey mayor Mario Guerra, referring to the strike-ending announcement. “But there are a lot of things that need fixing here in Los Angeles. Everybody’s always looking for the next ladder up (to higher office). I think he should keep his campaign promises and fix the city first.”
• The apparent triumph for Garcetti, who publicly became involved in the negotiations shortly after the strike began Jan. 14, could blow up in his face if he overplays his hand by trying to overstate his role or the significance of the achievement.
• Even if he plays the deal-maker card right, Garcetti’s presidential bid won’t get a boost unless the rest of America notices. As of Tuesday afternoon the end of the L.A. teachers strike wasn’t a prominent headline on the Associated Press, New York Times or Washington Post websites.
In any case, Garcetti’s successful intervention in the standoff over teachers’ pay, class sizes and charter schools doesn’t remove other obstacles to a successful campaign for the Democratic nomination. Nobody has ever vaulted directly from mayor to president. (At least three other mayors have entered or are considering the 2020 race: Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.) And Garcetti would start the campaign less well-known than the acknowledged leading contenders, who come mostly from the ranks of U.S. Senate and state governors.
“Ultimately, he’s someone who’s going to have to establish himself on the national stage,” said Kondik, the elections analyst from Virginia.
Garcetti wouldn’t even begin as the best-known Californian. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris announced her candidacy Monday.
But Hernandez, the East L.A. College political scientist, didn’t think Harris’ prominence changes the calculus for Garcetti.
“I don’t think he has to worry about another Californian in the field,” Hernandez said. “He has to worry about whether his personality will excite voters.”
Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb responded to a reporter’s question about a potential Garcetti announcement with an email Tuesday saying: “We’ll update you when there’s an update!”
Hernandez called the teachers-strike settlement a net plus for Garcetti’s presidential hopes.
“It makes him look a little more productive than would otherwise be the case.”

Giuliani, trying to walk back comments about Trump and Moscow, muddies the waters. Again.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani once again appeared to muddy the waters around special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in an interview in which he ostensibly intended to clear things up.
On Sunday, Giuliani made headlines when he said that Trump may have been involved in conversations about the efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow up until Election Day 2016. He even told The New York Times that the president said talks about the project were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won. "
Since then, Giuliani has been trying to walk back his assertions. In a three-sentence statement on Monday, he said his comments were "hypothetical," not "based on conversations" and "did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any discussions. "
"I did not say that," Giuliani told The New Yorker when asked about the quote in a phone interview on Monday. He accused the paper of "deliberately" misunderstanding his remarks.
"I don’t know if they made it up. What I was talking about was, if he had those conversations, they would not be criminal," Giuliani said.
"Mr. Giuliani was quoted fairly and accurately in our story. We stand by our reporting," the Times said in a statement responding to Giuliani's allegation.
Giuliani, in his interview with The New Yorker, explained that "lawyers argue in the alternative" and that was why people are so often confused by his statements.
"I was pointing out how you would deal with it in court if we were going to trial, and how, even if there were such conversations, which there weren’t, they would be completely innocent," he said. "Whenever you do that, you always run the risk someone is going to report just the first part of your conversation. "
He told The New Yorker that Trump had "a few conversations" about the project when it was an "early-stage proposal that he ended somewhere in early 2016. " He said the president "doesn’t have a recollection of anything else, and there is nothing to support anything else. "
Giuliani said the project never moved beyond an October 2015 letter of intent, which was signed by Trump (Giuliani reportedly initially denied the letter had ever been signed, then denied saying that when CNN obtained a signed copy of the document).
More: Trump signed letter of intent for Moscow project in Oct. 2015, report says
Despite the furor on Sunday over the revelations about the timeline for the Trump Tower Moscow project, Giuliani actually first made the admission more than a month ago. He said during an interview with New York Daily News on Dec. 18 that the talks might have continued up until November 2016.
"Trump doesn’t remember exactly when the discussions stopped," Giuliani said in that interview, adding that the president's written answers to questions from Mueller "made sure it could cover up until November 2016. "
Giuliani clarifies comments: 'Not based on conversations'
More: Rudy Giuliani says he is '100% certain' Trump did not tell Cohen to lie to Congress
The revelation of the Moscow project came in December when Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the proposed deal. The news appeared to contradict Trump's repeated statements on the campaign trail that he "had nothing to do with Russia. "
Trump, whose 2016 campaign is being investigated by Mueller for conspiring with Russians to sway the election, defended the negotiations as "very legal" and "very cool" and falsely claimed to have been open about the project during the campaign.
Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that the special counsel had evidence Trump had directed Cohen to lie about the Moscow project in his congressional testimony. Mueller's office then issued a rare public statement denying the report.
On Sunday, Giuliani said BuzzFeed "should be under investigation" for the report, which the news site has not retracted. He said that even if Trump spoke to Cohen about his testimony – which he claimed would be "perfectly normal" – he was "100 percent certain" the president did not tell Cohen to lie.
He told the New Yorker that "from the moment I read the story, I knew the story was false. "
"I have been through all the tapes, I have been through all the texts, I have been through all the e-mails, and I knew none existed" that would support the BuzzFeed story, he said.
When asked what tapes he was referring to, Giuliani said, "I shouldn’t have said tapes. They alleged there were texts and e-mails that corroborated that Cohen was saying the president told him to lie. There were no texts, there were no e-mails, and the president never told him to lie. "
"Well, I have listened to tapes, but none of them concern this," he added.
The kerfuffle over the Moscow timeline is not the first time Giuliani has appeared to reveal more than he intended in an interview. In May while speaking with Fox News host Sean Hannity, he revealed that Trump had repaid Cohen for $130,000 in hush money the president's former fixer had given to porn star Stormy Daniels. And last week, he denied ever saying "there was no collusion" between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The New York Times reported on Monday that "several people close to Mr. Trump have grown exasperated with Mr. Giuliani’s public appearances. They also expressed concern that he is increasing prosecutors’ anger with the president and potentially creating a misimpression about the Trump Tower project in Moscow. "
Giuliani, who as Trump's attorney has said "truth isn't truth" and facts are "in the eye of the beholder," joked to The New Yorker that he fears his tombstone will read, "Rudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump. "
"Somehow, I don’t think that will be it. But, if it is, so what do I care? I’ll be dead. I figure I can explain it to St. Peter," he said.

Texto completo: Reading the Northwest
When Pam Houston was 31, fresh off the success of her first book, "Cowboys are my Weakness," she drove across the American West, giving readings, living out of her car "and looking for a place to call home."
She drove north from San Francisco, all the way to Bellingham, before heading east across Washington, Idaho and Montana. She seriously considered a 44-acre plot in Winthrop, Washington, before finally settling on a rugged 120-acre Colorado ranch near the headwaters of the Rio Grande, which she bought for 5 percent down plus a signed copy of her book.
The story of how she learned to take care of the ranch - and how the ranch took care of her - forms the basis of Houston's new book "Deep Creek: Finding Hope in the High Country." The book is an elegy to the disappearing wild places on Earth, including her pocket of paradise, where cellphone towers are banned, developers are persona non grata and the pantry is always stocked against the next three-day snowstorm.
Houston, will share her story in Spokane when the Northwest Passages Book Club gathers on Feb. 12.
Houston says she set down roots almost impulsively after a traumatic childhood followed by years of thrill-seeking - from whitewater rafting and backcountry skiing to guiding big-game hunters deep into the Alaskan wilderness. Buying the $400,000 ranch with her $21,000 in book royalties was another adrenaline rush, and Houston was fairly sure she would eventually default on the note and lose the property.
"I don't think it was exactly a thought-through moment of wisdom and clarity," she said in an interview. "I just fell instantly in love with it when I saw it, and some part of me that I previously had no access to reared up and said: You could make a home here."
Houston grew up in New Jersey and Pennsylvania but made her way west after college and never looked back. She spent time in Colorado and Utah as well as Alaska, often in wilderness settings that form the background for her highly autobiographical fiction - she now calls it "autofiction." And it's not just any part of the West that draws her in - it's the "high and dry" country east of the Pacific range.
Asked to explain the attraction, Houston can veer into the mystical, describing her physical reaction to the rugged landscape of jagged peaks and open valleys.
"The same thing happened the first time I went to the Himalayas," she said. "Is that past-life stuff? Was I a Buddhist monk on a mountain in Tibet? I mean, who knows? But I have a natural reaction to that set of circumstances."
That attraction to high desert country is probably why she put down earnest money on the spread in Winthrop as she was driving up the coast so long ago. "It was the first place where there weren't so many trees," she said, laughing. "It was the first place on my trek that I got out of that coastal climate and back into the high, dry mountain basin-and-range climate."
Houston's essays glow with love and humor as she describes her life with horses, wolfhounds, sheep, two mini-donkeys and a cat, Mr. Kitty. "I don't ever underestimate the importance of animals in my life," she said. "Because of the way I was raised, because of the trouble in my household, I trust animals automatically in a way that I don't ever trust people right off the bat.  For me, so many of my lessons have come not just from my dogs and my horses, who I'm super emotionally close to, but also from the sheep and the chickens. There's something to be learned even from the animals who aren't cuddly."
Houston writes movingly about her love for the land and this "dying planet," rejecting the ironic eye-rolls and "hollow chuckles" she sometimes gets from colleagues at the University of California, Davis, where she lives half the year teaching English.
"One of the things living in the West - what I'll call the real West - has done for me is made me see it's OK to be sincere," she said. "It's OK to be earnest. It's OK to have gratitude and compassion." When she's not tramping across her meadows at 9,000 feet, Houston teaches at the university and at fabulous-sounding writing conferences in Santa Fe, Mallorca and Big Sur. But sometimes, she says, the academic life makes her want to just "go back to my ranch and praise the grasses."
"Deep Creek" is a love story that tells how Houston found salvation through the hard work of maintaining the ranch and the joy of hiking through the aspen and spruce forests that cover the mountainsides around her pasture. (Or did, until a massive wildfire tore through the area in 2013, sparing her home but blackening more than 110,000 acres.)
As readers of Houston's fiction and nonfiction know, her relationship with men has often been complicated, to say the least. Buying the ranch helped steady her, she says. After years of chasing "nasty cowboys," Houston realized "I could make my own life  . I could have my own ranch. I finally realized I could be the cowboy."
Along the way she found love with her new husband, Mike Blakeman, a Forest Service worker who she calls "even more dedicated to the Upper Rio Grande Valley than I am.
"I'm letting myself be loved by a man in a way I haven't ever, and it's terrific," she says. "I'm just really happy."

Texto completo: Noah, 6, knelt on a chair, hunching over a sheet of pale blue construction paper. Brown crayon in hand, he frowned in concentration as he drew stick figures and wobbly shapes.
His sister, Skyler, 3, bumped into elbows and chattered as she ran around the Casita Maria Center for Arts and Education in the South Bronx. When she climbed up beside Noah, he scooted over to make room, never looking up from his picture.
"Noah's lovable. Always smiling, always dancing, always hugging," their mother, Rosemary Cruz, 36, said on a recent afternoon at the center. "He loves to give big hugs. Right, Noah?"
Noah dropped his crayon, scrambled off his chair, and in two leaps landed in his mother's lap. They wrapped their arms around each other tightly, and Noah beamed, revealing a prominent underbite, a physical sign of his disabilities.
For Ms. Cruz and her children (she has four), the Casita Maria Center, an 85-year-old charitable organization for the local Latino community, is like a second home. In fact, it has been a part of Ms. Cruz's life since she was a teenager.
Looking to earn money in her youth, Ms. Cruz heard about a local Beacon Youth Program that matched teenagers to jobs. She received a selective semester-long business internship at the Casita Maria Center, which has a wide variety of arts offerings, in addition to academic-based programs.
After Ms. Cruz graduated from high school, she got her first job at the center as a group leader. She worked one session, September to June, and was offered one of the limited positions available for the summer session. "It was a privilege," she said, to be chosen even once. Ms. Cruz worked every fall and summer session for 12 years.
Along the way, she had her first two children -- Neven, 13, and Serenity, 11 -- and they sampled piano, chorus, violin, dancing and more at the center. Ms. Cruz saw her children flourish in programs that would have been otherwise unaffordable.
Ms. Cruz picked up additional part-time employment, eventually juggling jobs at Kmart and an Olan Mills photography studio while continuing to work at Casita Maria. She often had to leave her children with her grandmother.
In 2012, Ms. Cruz was unable to work the summer session at Casita Maria for the first time; she was in the final stages of her pregnancy with Noah. She left Olan Mills and took maternity leave from Kmart, returning when Noah was a couple of months old.
As Noah grew, Ms. Cruz noticed some unusual symptoms when he tried to speak.
"I thought he would learn, that eventually he would get to it," Ms. Cruz said. But "because he had the underbite, every time he would try to talk, I couldn't hear him."
She took him to see several doctors; by his third birthday, he had regular speech and occupational therapy appointments, while she continued to try to find specialists who could help.
Amid managing his appointments, Ms. Cruz left Kmart in 2013 and worked in the city's Environmental Protection Department as part of New York's back-to-work program. The next year, she worked at a supermarket until Skyler's birth.
To monitor Skyler's early developmental progress, Ms. Cruz stopped working briefly and received public assistance. "Family is time," said Ms. Cruz. "You need to give your family time."
In 2016, once again, Ms. Cruz prepared to go back to work regularly. She took classes and earned a certificate to become a home attendant; she found work earning $9 an hour. However, lengthy commutes to other boroughs had Ms. Cruz searching for employment closer to home.
Her persistence was rewarded on Noah's 4th birthday, when she was offered a school crossing guard position near their home. She now works five days a week, five hours a day, earning $13.50 an hour.
With this income, $400 a month in child support, and $426 a month in food stamps, Ms. Cruz can pay $700 a month for her three-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment and support her children.
Instead of commuting, Ms. Cruz is more active in her children's lives, even volunteering at Noah's school, where she is secretary of the parents association.
"Because I'm in the school," she said, "I'm able to speak to them personally and talk about Noah and how he's doing."
From Noah's teachers, she learns what exercises, sounds and words he is struggling with, then works with him on those lessons at home.
"You can't rush things with him. You have to do it step by step," said Ms. Cruz. She said she truly feels as though she is on a team with his teacher and paraprofessional. "If we work together," she added, "I know that eventually he'll go above and beyond."
Money is tight, so in November, Ms. Cruz reached out to her friends at Casita Maria, where Serenity and Noah had just completed a summer session. Working with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Casita Maria awarded Ms. Cruz a Neediest Cases grant of $370 to buy educational toys for Noah and Skyler, and winter coats, gloves and boots for Neven and Serenity.
For Skyler, who likes listening to heartbeats, Ms. Cruz chose a doll with a toy doctor's set. She bought Noah magnet toys and puzzles to help develop his fine motor skills.
At Casita Maria, Serenity, a shy honor student, tried dance class for the first time, and now she dreams of becoming a professional hip-hop or salsa dancer.
Next semester Neven, through a collaboration between Casita Maria and his school, the Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists, will participate in an after-school clinic to keep his grades strong in preparation for his ambition to become a police officer.
"We are a Casita family," Ms. Cruz said. "I want my children to finish college and get a career. If that's not what they want to do, then I want them to do something that they love."

A conspiracy of dunces

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: In case you missed Ronald C. Todd's name among the flurry of cabinet-level appointments by Gov. Mike DeWine, not to worry.
You'll probably see him soon. When you do, you'll remember him. Six feet three. Bowtie. Baritone voice and megawatt smile to go with it. Looks like he could have played a little football back in the day.
Finally, you'll probably leave thinking Todd is the most optimistic person you've ever met.
Meet the governor's new minority affairs liaison. Todd, 51, lives in Roselawn with his wife, Janice, and daughter, Kendall. He will be the point person on things like minority business development, faith-based initiatives and government access.
He served in a similar role as a consultant in Jon Husted's secretary of state's office. Husted is now lieutenant governor. The two met 30 years ago while they were working out at the University of Dayton, where Husted was a defensive back. Todd was thinking about going to UD. A lifelong friendship ensued.
Todd wants to use his new role to inspire and connect diverse Ohioans to a government that works for them, he told me.
"If you look at the inauguration, Gov. DeWine's theme was faith, family and friends. To me, that's so important. What we've got to do is empower the folks who think they are powerless, who don't have any hope," Todd said. "I have always had a burning desire to make a difference, so kids who come from where I come from can believe they can make it."
Where he came from was west Dayton, which never fully recovered from the deadly riots of 1966. He learned the value of hard work and sacrifice from mom and dad. He is a third-generation Republican.
"I was taught that nobody owes you anything. You work for that. As I got involved in the business community, I began to understand relationships. This job is all about how to develop relationships so that people get to know each other," Todd said.
Sports initially brought Todd success. And, yes, he did play a little football. He was an all-city lineman at Belmont High School in Dayton, good enough to earn a scholarship to Bowling Green State University as a 275-pound, offensive tackle.
He later earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Ohio Dominican University in Columbus.
Todd's appointment fulfills a DeWine campaign promise to hire a diverse staff with the best people. He has appointed 13 women and five African Americans to cabinet-level positions. Nationally, the Republican party continues to struggle to attract ethnically diverse supporters and continues to be its own worst enemy. This week, lawmakers stripped Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, of all his committee assignments. He expressed support for the concept of white supremacy in a New York Times story.
For the first 16 years of his career, Todd was a sports agent. An ESPN writer once dubbed him "the people's champion" who represented the "athletic working class." He taught his clients that faith, education and character matter, something he learned from his parents.
He also sought to help his clients prepare for solid financial future after sports.
At 27, he became the youngest African-American agent to negotiate a first-round draft pick. His client was the great Hugh Douglas, a defensive end out of Central State University. Douglas became rookie of the year for the New York Jets and later a standout for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Later, he founded an insurance brokerage business and consulting firm in Dayton.
As a 17-year-old college freshman, Todd had a short bio in Bowling Green's 1985 team marketing literature. He said he wanted to own a public relations firm and become governor of Ohio one day.
"I'm a testament to having faith and having patience. You have to believe in the American dream. The American dream is real. I know right now it seems cloudy, but I'm a testimony that it does work," he said.
Looks like Todd is working his way back to those goals.

Gillette commercial controversy: Give men credit instead of painting masculinity as poison

Texto completo: When I viewed Gillette’s “toxic masculinity” TV ad — the one that portrays a line of men shrugging, “Boys will be boys,” while their fellows bully the weak, help themselves to unwanted sexual contact, and shut up their female colleagues at work — my first, admittedly tongue-in-cheek thought was: how clever.
Let’s see, I reasoned: Gillette’s specialty is shaving equipment, and ever increasing numbers of men, especially beard-crazy millennials, aren’t shaving these days. Gillette is simply repositioning itself from a marketer to men into a marketer to women.
And what sells better to women than male-bashing? From “doofus Dad” commercials hawking laundry detergent, to a #MeToo movement that mushroomed overnight from allegations of sexual exploitation in the entertainment industry to complaints about bad dates with guys with crude foreplay skills, women make a ready audience for material that tells them that there’s something fundamentally wrong — maybe it’s patriarchal cultural conditioning — with the other half of the human race.
Read more commentary:
Gillette commercial controversy: Men should just get over it and adapt to #MeToo era
If you're mad at Gillette's toxic masculinity commercial, maybe you're the problem
Why did it take Susan Zirinsky 46 years to become president of CBS News?
New York Times best-selling author Jessica Valenti writes: “It’s true that women are fed up with sexual violence and harassment; but it’s also true that what this culture considers ‘normal’ sexual behavior is often harmful to women, and that we want that to stop, too. ” In other words, normal maleness is bad and needs to be changed — and that’s why Jessica Valenti is a New York Times best-selling author.
Gillette's male-bashing ploy as marketing
There is some irony here. A leading study involving 8,520 women published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology in 2016 suggests that men are growing facial hair, and eschewing shaving, because women like it that way. The study concludes that women prefer men with beards because they view beards — from stubble to the full-blown thing — "as a signal of intrasexual formidability," that is, of being tough and aggressive and masculine, which women view as valuable traits for protecting themselves and their children.
In short, women may say masculinity is toxic, but they go for toxic every time. You might conclude that Gillette, by invoking every cliché in the male-bashing handbook, lets women have their masculinity cake and eat it, too — and also pick up one of Gillette’s Venus line of razors for females while they’re at it.
That was my tongue-in-cheek take on the ad. Now for my serious take. Many people might ask: What’s wrong with telling men not to bully each other or harass women? After all, males commit the overwhelming majority of violent crimes — a byproduct of the physical aggressiveness that goes with testosterone.
Men deserve more credit than Gillette gives
The problem with the Gillette ad isn’t that it points out that males commit antisocial acts. It’s its blithe assumption that other males routinely let them get away with it. This is what has infuriated hundreds of thousands of men to the point of threatening to boycott Gillette.
They rightfully point out that supposedly patriarchal Western culture (which, by the way, treats women more respectfully than any other culture humans have ever invented) doesn’t “normalize” male acts that harm others, but, rather, quite the opposite. Men might say “boys will be boys” when their son breaks a lamp playing fetch with the dog in the living room. They don’t say it when their son joins a gang that beats up other boys in the schoolyard. This is not to say such activity, along with its adult equivalents, isn’t uncommon, or that there isn’t often peer pressure for men, especially young men, to misbehave. But men have devised institutions — called civilization — designed to channel male aggression in positive directions, such as heroism that saves lives or hard work that supports families. They deserve credit for that.
One of those institutions is fatherhood. It’s fathers who are chiefly responsible for turning young male barbarians into gentlemen instead of rapists, boors and bullies. Right now, one out of every four boys in America grows up in a home without a father and pays a price in the well-documented social disorder that has ensued. If Gillette wants to get into the preaching business, it might want to focus on that problem instead of tarring men in general as violence-enablers in need of re-education and their very masculinity as a kind of poison.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: (GPS) Navigating Healthy Families will present: Enough as They Are: Helping Teens Move Beyond the Impossible Standards of Success.
Teens may seem more successful today, yet they’ve also never struggled more with anxiety, stress and depression. Rachel Simmons will tackle these topics during two presentations: one at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 29, at the College of DuPage McAninch Center in Glen Ellyn and the second at noon Wednesday, Jan. 30, at the Marquardt School District 15 administration center, 1860 Glen Ellyn Road in Glendale Heights.
Simmons translates the toxic messages about achievement that teens have internalized and teaches parents how to help young people practice self-compassion, redefine success, pursue purpose, and most importantly, let them know they are enough as they are.
Simmons, who has been researching and inspiring young women for two decades, is the author of "Enough as She Is" and the New York Times bestsellers "Odd Girl Out" and "The Curse of the Good Girl."
Simmons will share the strategies to help girls and boys overcome brutal self-criticism, an acute fear of failure and feelings that they will never be smart enough, successful enough, attractive enough, thin enough or popular enough. She will share practical parenting wisdom, including teaching teens how to manage overthinking, resist the constant urge to compare themselves to peers, take healthy risks, navigate negative elements of social media, prioritize self-care and seek support when needed to not just survive but thrive.
Students are encouraged to attend.

This 'Pelléas' Shows Who's in Charge Here

Texto completo: Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the new music director of the Metropolitan Opera, may not have many appearances with the company this season. But conducting the opening of Debussy's "Pelléas et Mélisande" on Tuesday night, he seemed fully in charge.
The 43-year-old conductor captured the hushed eeriness of the work's first few measures, in which the orchestra suggests the somber, mysterious mood that pervades the entire opera. But that's not all.
What also came through immediately was that, still fresh in his new role at the Met, Mr. Nézet-Séguin has arrived with bold interpretive ideas and the determination to carry them out. He took a daringly slow tempo in this opening passage, a solemn, low theme in chords that hints at modal plainchant. The restrained sound of the strings was deep and dark, yet resonant and slightly tremulous. The theme that immediately follows -- a nervous, oscillating two-note motif -- was all the more ominous for his subdued, weighty rendering.
[Video: Pelléas et Mélisande: Orchestral Introduction Watch on YouTube.]
[Why it matters that the Met's music director is openly gay]
Throughout this long work, Mr. Nézet-Séguin conveyed the subliminal intensity that courses through even the most seemingly languid and diaphanous passages. The fraught eruptions had shattering impact. During whole stretches, the orchestra enshrouds the vocal lines with sonorities that give lift and clarity to the sung words, while tapping into the psychological undertow of the emotions. All this came through in the performances Mr. Nézet-Séguin drew from the inspired orchestra and admirable cast.
In a revealing interview with The New York Times published this week, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said that the "basic presence of the orchestral sound" at the Met is not exactly what he imagines it could be. With his elegant, vibrant performances of Verdi's "La Traviata" in December, he worked to bring out what he called a richer, more resonant and bass-oriented sound.
Though his comments were a little vague, what he is describing generally characterized this "Pelléas." He emphasized the Wagnerian elements that seeped into Debussy's score, especially with the orchestra's deep-set, warm sound -- which did seem different from the lighter textures favored by his predecessor, James Levine. (Mr. Levine was fired last year over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied.) Yet, the weightiness was balanced by French-styled radiance in the opera's many iridescent passages.
[Video: Pelléas et Mélisande: Orchestral Interlude Watch on YouTube.]
This "Pelléas" is the first revival in nearly a decade of Jonathan Miller's 1995 production, which metaphorically sets the story of an ill-fated family in a Gothic 19th-century castle where outdoor forests and chalky inner sanctums seem to merge. The sense of doom that runs through this opera, with a libretto Debussy adapted from Maeterlinck's Symbolist play, came through in the opening scene between Prince Golaud, a grandson of King Arkel of Allemonde, and Mélisande, the frightened, secretive young woman Golaud encounters weeping by a fountain in the forest. The bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen commanded the stage as Golaud, his voice robust and strong, yet grave.
A lonely widower, Golaud is at once drawn to and protective of Mélisande. He knows not to press her immediately with questions about where she has come from, who has harmed her, and how. The mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard brought a melting sound to Mélisande while suggesting the character's fears and volatility. Yet, she intriguingly tapped into this fragile young woman's willfulness. After all, it takes control to maintain secrets (and to downright lie) as Mélisande does. You understand why she almost passively, as we soon learn, marries Golaud. What other course is there? In a way, what does it matter?
[Video: Pelléas et Mélisande: Act IV Excerpt Watch on YouTube.]
The tenor Paul Appleby brought youthful impulsiveness and sweetness to Pelléas, Golaud's impressionable younger half brother, who falls uncontrollably in love with Mélisande. But on Tuesday, he seemed vocally underpowered, especially in his lower register. The role has been sung both by light baritones and tenors. Mr. Appleby's voice had more presence when the music took him into his bright, upper range.
The veteran bass Ferruccio Furlanetto, singing with earthy sound and aching sadness, was magnificent as the old, nearly-blind Arkel, who seems to accept that all people, even the members of his sullen family, are guided by fates we can only guess at. The plush-voiced contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux had a notable Met debut in the small but crucial role of Geneviève, the wistful mother to both Golaud and Pelléas. A. Jesse Schopflocher, an impressive treble, made an endearing Yniold, Golaud's young son, who is baffled by the adults and turns fearful when his father is seized with violent jealousy of his wife.
Alas, there are only four remaining performances, with Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducting just three. It will take time for him to fill out his schedule at the Met. But it's worth the wait.

Texto completo: In the old days (meaning pre-Trump), the op-ed pages of the New York Times and Washington Post were dominated by liberals but always included brilliant conservative columnists (for example, William Safire in the Times and George Will in the Post) as part of the mix. Safire has died, but been replaced by Times conservatives like Ross Douthat and David Brooks. But it’s awkward, if that’s the word I want, that none of the designated conservatives will defend Donald Trump. In fact, they pretty much detest him. Will, for example, referred to Trump as “our child president” in a 2018 post-Helsinki-summit column headlined “This sad, embarrassing wreck of a man.”
The other leading righty (her column is titled “Right Turn”) among the Post’s regulars is Jennifer Rubin who, likewise, can’t stand Trump and now goes on MSNBC, for example, to denounce Trump and often Republicans in general.
I long since got over my shock at Rubin’s willingness to slam Trump, but sometimes she hits him harder than the lefties do, as in Tuesday’s column, headlined: “Trump’s pitiful powerlessness,” hitting the power-loving Trump where it hurt, with lines like this (Rubin’s full first paragraph):
The full impact of divided government, improved media coverage, the departure of any competent staff and President Trump’s fecklessness have transformed him into a floundering lame duck. His Oval Office address, immediately fact-checked, persuaded no one. Without a Republican-majority House or a visible Senate majority leader (we’ll need one of those bloodhounds to track down Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell), Trump flails against reality. The lies (terrorists are coming over the border!) are harder to sustain, a useful target is not readily available (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has tied him up in knots), and he has done something so stupid and harmful to his own voters (who are among those not getting paid and not getting government services) that even the illusion of “winning” cannot be sustained.
Rubin’s second paragraph ends with three words. Well actually one word, three times:
“Weak, weak, weak.”
I won’t say I felt sorry for the guy, but it’s pertnear the closest I’ve come to it.
The full “Right Turn” “pitiful powerlessness” Rubin column is here.

Media’s bias should be toward democracy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The belief that constitutional democracy is superior to other forms of government rests in part on its capacity to encourage open debate and thus social learning.


Social learning is underrated. Citizens can and do learn together and from each other. They pick up tidbits and cues from the public debate and then argue over back fences or kitchen tables, in their houses of worship or at their favorite bars and restaurants.


True, this is an idealized view. In the Trump era, many people avoid political talk with neighbors or family members they disagree with for fear of igniting bitter shouting matches.


And social learning is problematic when we only hang around with people who reinforce our own views and prejudices, as Bill Bishop suggested in his revelatory book, “The Big Sort.” Social media pushes us further into ideological silos, something Russian hackers understood in 2016.


It ought to be the job of traditional media to help break this cycle. As Matthew Pressman shows in his recent history of journalism, “On Press,” there was a purpose behind the old ideas of “objectivity” and “fairness.” At their best, journalists examine questions of genuine importance and offer citizens a chance to hear competing arguments on various sides of the issues at stake. This task includes pointing out when claims are at odds with the facts.


Now only a naive rationalist would claim that politics is purely cerebral. It’s also about passion, self-interest and the foibles of would-be political leaders. But for democracy to work well, we need a balance among reason, emotion and interest. When reason is in retreat and when candidates are given strong incentives to stir up ugly passions, we have a problem.


This is where we are now, and President Trump is both the product of this crisis and its apotheosis. He brought home just how nonsensical and dishonest our politics have become with his assertion last Thursday about Mexico paying for his border wall: “Obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they’re going to write out a check.”


This was shocking, even from an unrepentant liar. Trump denied ever saying something that, as David Nakamura reported in The Washington Post, he did say “at least 212 times during his campaign and dozens more since he took office.”


This points to the media’s major shortcoming in 2016: its continuing commitment to “both sides are equally flawed” journalism, which led to its failure to portray Trump as the moral aberration he is. As Frank Bruni recently noted in The New York Times (citing the research of Harvard professor Thomas Patterson), treating Trump and Hillary Clinton “identically” in terms of their “fitness for office” was “madness.”


And as the Post’s media critic Margaret Sullivan noted, journalism needs to pull back from a “focus on personalities and electability” and on blowing gaffes “way out of proportion.” She endorsed New York University professor Jay Rosen’s idea that the press follow a “citizens agenda” in 2020. Why not more reporting on the problems voters care about and how candidates propose to solve them?


There are obvious responses to all this: Many voters knew who Trump was and voted for him anyway because they disliked Clinton even more; the critics just don’t like the way the election turned out; and many of our fellow citizens are so stuck in “media bubbles” that what mainstream journalism does won’t matter.


But whatever their merits, these assertions come down to a denial of responsibility. The mainstream media still greatly influence how we talk to each other about politics and should take this responsibility seriously.


Consider just two examples. A video of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s collegiate dancing made for fun stories, but it’s far less important than the New York Democrat’s proposal for a 70 percent tax rate on incomes of over $10 million. Coverage of Trump’s 2016 attacks on Jeb Bush for his “low energy” were a successful distraction from a serious conversation about Bush’s prophetic assertion that Trump would be a “chaos president.”


None of this takes away from the fact that journalists still provide an abundance of accurate information. This includes, thank goodness, smart and tough coverage of Trump.


But Bruni, Sullivan, Patterson and Rosen are right to ask the media to ponder what role it has played in bringing our democracy to its current state. The arbiters of the news should be encouraging better conversations over those back fences — and doing a better job of warning us early on about politicians who lie even about their lies.

I survived combat in Iraq and a suicide attempt at home. But many veterans aren't so lucky.

Texto completo: I'm supposed to be a statistic.
On July 14, 2012, drowning in grief and guilt, I tried to kill myself. Like so many veterans, I had found civilian life desperately difficult. War had drained me of joy. The sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield had been relentlessly looping in my head. The suffering seemed endless. And so, thinking there were no other options of escape, I turned to suicide.
Luckily, I survived. I avoided becoming one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves every day in this country. But I also witnessed firsthand all the ways that our nation's mental health resources fail our fighting men and women. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and the military simply aren't equipped to properly treat sick vets. We must do better.
Read more commentary:
My husband lost a limb in Afghanistan. Now, as his caregiver, I'm on the front lines.
My partner died by suicide. He doesn't know the damage he left behind.
I lost my job because of the government shutdown, and my family isn't the only one at risk
I enlisted in the military on Sept. 11, 2001. My first major combat experience came on a deployment to Sadr City, Iraq, in the winter of 2005, the apex of the insurgency.
War inflicts permanent psychic scars on survivors. Scrubbing a friend's flesh out of a Bradley reconnaissance vehicle, packing up the cold clothes of a new dad to ship home to his family, pulling tortured corpses out of a water treatment facility — the trauma from these experiences is deep and lasting.
Veterans lost to trauma, rather than combat
That trauma can be more deadly than war itself. More of my brothers from that deployment have died from suicide than combat: Nine were killed in Iraq; 15 have killed themselves back at home.
Our company commander, a decorated vet boasting four Meritorious Service Medals, shot himself on Jan. 16, 2016. He was just 44 years old. Readers of his obituary in the local newspaper might have recognized his face; two years earlier, he had appeared in a photo story about a local military appreciation fish fry, grinning from ear-to-ear and playing with his beloved dogs.
My grandfather, a World War II veteran, committed suicide when my father was sent to Vietnam.
And just last month, decorated Navy Vice Adm. Scott Stearney's body was found in his Bahrain residence after an apparent suicide. During his life, Vice Adm. Stearney was awarded the Air Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Superior Service Medal.
Many vets feel ashamed that they're suffering and work to hide their pain, even from their closest friends and family. When a universally respected officer takes his life, the despair trickles down the chain of command.
Vets shouldn't be dying in a VA parking lot
Existing mental health services for vets are clearly insufficient. From 2001 to 2014, vet suicides have jumped 32 percent. The problem is only going to get worse.
Too many VA facilities simply don't have enough staff to provide personalized care. Therapists are badly outnumbered and vets are hurried through their offices.
Sometimes, staffing shortages force facilities to simply turn vets away, leading to the grotesque phenomenon of desperate soldiers killing themselves on VA grounds.
One 51-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran set himself on fire in front of a New Jersey VA clinic after a canceled appointment. Another veteran shot himself in the waiting room of a VA medical center. A 76-year-old vet shot himself in the parking lot of his Long Island VA facility because "he went to the ER and was denied service," as a hospital employee explained to The New York Times.
But improving treatment requires more than new resources. Our mental health system must also evolve its therapeutic paradigms to be more proactive, treating the root causes of mental illness. Too often, VA facilities are purely reactive, only kicking into action once a vet is suffering a crisis. Proactively addressing the precursors to suicidal ideation can prevent the crisis in the first place.
One of those key precursors is isolation. We go to war with our brothers — but we're left to fight demons at home by ourselves. The VA mental health system needs to create more opportunities for vets to meet each other, share their stories, break that isolation, and process their pain. This is battle-forged trust and understanding. We need our battle buddies to survive post-combat as much as we need them to survive during it. Picnics, afternoon runs, bowling tournaments — simple gatherings can work wonders.
That's why my organization, the Independence Fund, is teaming up with the VA to carry out Operation Resiliency. The just launched partnership provides mental health training retreats for vets and their families, and encourages camaraderie among vets through adaptive sports.
Our military should have a role in prevention as well. Americans are expertly trained to go into battle but receive virtually zero training on what comes next. Each branch of the military should work with vets and their families to develop a personalized mental health plan for when they get home.
Veteran suicide is a national scandal. We must repair and expand the mental health system for our fighting men and women. We must win the war at home.
Danny O'Neel, an Iraq War veteran, is a speaker on suicide prevention, PTSD and mental health for the Independence Fund.

In this Cleveland hall, classical music is king; In a city renowned for rock, a grand symphonic venue

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip.
"This is going to be something," said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra's viola players. "This is a freight train."
Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America's most admired classical music venues.
This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.
Conductor Franz Welser-Most raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.
Inside the hall
When the orchestra's leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America built skyscrapers, Cleveland's steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.
The city's population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.
Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.
As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.
A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall, which didn't quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall's Georgian neoclassical exterior is "Pomp and Circumstance" at 23 beats a minute.
But inside, it's "Rhapsody in Blue" meets "King Tut." Once you step into the grand foyer, you're swallowed by a mashup of art deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.
It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm. Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in California, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929.
Yet John didn't hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth's personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today. It opened in 1931.
The intricate, lacelike aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth's wedding dress.
"He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from," Hoy told me.
The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.
As for Cleveland's orchestra, the musicians never relinquished the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January last year a New York Times headline proclaimed that "At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America's Best." (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)
Bela Bartok, Leonard Bernstein, Benny Goodman, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich - all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.
It remains the orchestra's home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, Cleveland Pops Orchestra concerts and other events.
The legacy
On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue's fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.
The music began with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I'm no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.
The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.
The next piece was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 - a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.
After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, composed in 1928.
Before beginning, Welser-Most addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us "to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath."
Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming timpani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending - a beginning as dark and alarming as the night's first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.
From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.
At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.
At Cleveland's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.

Carol Channing, the raspy-voiced star who created two of Broadway’s unforgettable characters and songs, in Hello, Dolly! and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, has died. She was 97.
She died on Tuesday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., according to the New York Times, citing her publicist, B. Harlan Boll. She had two strokes in the past year.
Channing’s five-decade career included cabaret, film and television as well as the theater, where she won her greatest acclaim with a gravelly voice, wide smile and platinum blond bouffant — which she achieved through wigs, as she was allergic to bleach.
She starred as Arkansas gold digger Lorelei Lee in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, which opened on Broadway in 1949. She popularized the song Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend along with Marilyn Monroe, who played Lorelei in the 1953 film version.
In Hello, Dolly!, Jerry Herman’s musical version of the Thornton Wilder play The Matchmaker, Channing used her bubbly wit to play the gaudy, self-assured title role of Dolly Gallagher Levi. New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson hailed her “shrewdly mischievous performance.”
All told, on Broadway and off, she played Dolly in 5,000 performances over 30 years, earning $5 million in her last tour, a 30th-anniversary production that began on Broadway in 1995.
Carol Elaine Channing was born on Jan. 31, 1921, in Seattle, the only child of George Channing, a newspaper editor, and the former Adelaide Glaser. It wasn’t until she wrote her 2002 autobiography that she disclosed the family secret that her father’s mother had been black.
“I was 16 years old and my mother told me,” she said on CNN’s Larry King Live.
She grew up in San Francisco and briefly studied theater at Bennington College in Vermont. Her first stage appearance was in 1941 as a singer in No for an Answer, a play that ran three performances.
In 1949, she got her first starring role, as Lorelei Lee in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes on Broadway, and went on its national tour from 1951 to 1953.
She went on to star in dozens of Broadway and touring plays, including Pygmalion and Wonderful Town.
Channing won Tony and New York Drama Critics awards for best actress in a musical and was given a Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 1995.

Texto completo: Adam Moss's decision to step down after 15 years as editor in chief of New York sent ripples through the magazine world. The New York Times spoke with peers and colleagues about his career and influence. Their remarks have been edited for length and clarity.
Graydon Carter
Former editor, Vanity Fair
"Adam was, and is, one of the giants. He had the instincts for a good story. He found and kept a great staff. And he knew that magazines had to surprise you visually on top of everything else."
Janice Min
Former editor, Us Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter
"I found him to be a really good example of what an editor can be, which is to try not to turn into a celebrity himself. I had lunch with him and -- I always laugh about this -- we were talking about people who go out too much, and I said, 'Do you just not go out?' He said, very dryly: 'The closer I get to death, the less I want to hang out with people I can't stand.' I just thought, 'I'm adopting that for the rest of my life.' Every time I turn down something, I think about that quote. Life becomes much clearer if you abide by that."
Frank Rich
Writer at large, New York; former Op-Ed columnist and theater critic, The New York Times
"I'm sitting in my office in the mid-1980s and someone who I didn't know calls me, says: 'I'm an editor at Esquire. I want to talk to you about a piece.' He said, 'Can I buy you a drink at Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle hotel?' As I later learned from him, he'd never been there before in his life. He was 29. I was halfway into my 10 years as drama critic. I eventually wrote a 10,000-word piece for him when I had a full-time demanding job -- that's how persuasive he was and creative as an editor. It planted the idea at The Times of me becoming an Op-Ed columnist. It completely changed my career."

Max Frankel
Former executive editor, The New York Times
"He had published that terrific little sheet called 7 Days. It was terrific. It had a great sense of both service and a feel for the city. And that was exactly the sensibility we wanted. We brought him in to help advise us on various projects, we got to know him, and we hired him."
Lynn Hirschberg
Editor at large, W; former contributor, The New York Times Magazine
"One of the things people don't say enough about him is what a great teacher he is. He would suggest something completely impossible, and I would say, 'Sure, Adam, I will do that completely impossible thing you have in mind, because I want you to be happy.' He has a gift for setting the bar very, very high and making you work over the level you thought you were capable of. He invests so much time in the process that you feel you have to live up to that investment."
"I'm happy for my friend, but I'm very sad for journalism, and I'm very sad especially for magazines, because I feel like it's very much the end of something. He's the best, he's the best, he's the best."
Olivia Nuzzi
Washington correspondent, New York
"More than anything else, what Adam's taught me -- and I'm not sure he knows he taught me this -- is how simple it should be to tell a story. It should be simple even if the story seems complicated. A few months ago, I was reporting on some palace intrigue in the West Wing, and Trump pulled me into the Oval Office to try to dissuade me from writing about it. Over the course of 20 minutes, we were joined by the vice president, the secretary of state and the president's chief of staff. I was agonizing about how to explain in writing what had happened; I didn't know where to even start. But Adam had the obvious answer: You just start where the story starts, and you tell it honestly, just as it happened and as you experienced it. Once I understood that, saw what he meant, it was easy."

Vanessa Grigoriadis
Contributor, The New York Times Magazine and Vanity Fair; former contributing editor, New York
"Most of us didn't know Adam when he came to New York. We knew The New York Times Magazine was incredible and that he had put Ecstasy on the cover, which we all thought was really cool."
"He's hands-on; I think everybody will tell you that. He just seems to know everything. In the old New York magazine, there was this idea that the more moguls you knew, the more important you were to the magazine. He really got rid of that. It became really about how smart you are, how quick you are and how much you can identify the zeitgeist. He's a workaholic, menschy, wry person. I wrote this story about Martha Stewart and her comeback from prison, and he said, 'You are some kind of genius.' And I said, 'I feel like the emphasis was just on some, not genius, but I'll take it.' He doesn't have a good poker face. You know exactly what he thinks of your story. Sometimes you think, 'Jeez, I didn't need to know that.' It feels like graduate school. We're all learning under this professor, and we want to impress him. He's the sensei, or something like that."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In 1896, Adolph S. Ochs, the 38-year-old publisher of what is now The Chattanooga Times Free Press, was wrestling with a problem. That March, he had received a telegram from Harry Alloway, an acquaintance and reporter for The New York Times, a paper in decay. Mr. Alloway wrote that after years of struggling, The Times could be bought for a relatively small amount of money. It was in desperate need of rescue, but Mr. Ochs didn't think he was capable of taking on such a challenge.
Herman H. Kohlsaat, the owner of The Chicago Times-Herald, gave Mr. Ochs some advice over dinner: "Don't tell anybody, and they'll never find out."
Eventually he was persuaded. A day after assuming the role of publisher of The Times, Mr. Ochs made a promise in the pages of the paper, under the headline "Business Announcement": "to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved." Those few words, it turned out, would help bring the paper back from the brink.
Impartiality, in which a clear distinction is drawn between the editorial section and the news report, is a cornerstone of newspapers today. But in the late 19th century, it was somewhat unusual. Papers openly aligned with political parties, and journalists often wove their opinions into their articles. New York tabloids known as penny presses thrived in such an environment; during the Spanish-American War, for example, William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer's New York World made a killing providing so-called "yellow journalism" to readers -- exaggerated and sometimes fantastical accounts of the war, available for just 1 cent.
Mr. Ochs had faced a similar situation in Chattanooga. The population there, torn apart in previous decades by the Civil War, was mistrustful; he revitalized the declining and mismanaged paper by developing its reputation for reliable and dispassionate coverage.
In 1896, The Times was the fourth-largest of the serious newspapers in New York City. There was The New York Sun, which, in Mr. Ochs's opinion, was weak in reporting; The New York Herald, which catered to high society; and The New York Tribune, which made no secret of its Republican leanings. (The Times itself had demonstrated both Republican and Democratic political biases at different times over its five-decade existence, and leaned Democrat since the election of Grover Cleveland in 1884.) In other words, there was room in the market for a paper readers could trust.
The Times needed some fixing up in other ways as well. The paper was difficult to read and lacked the necessary funds to produce regular photography, which Mr. Ochs immediately addressed by changing the type and improving the presses. Cuts were made -- including serial fiction -- as well as additions, some of which remain to this day: Mr. Ochs's wife, Effie Wise Ochs, loved literature and persuaded him to add a book review.
Under new management, advertisers called more, and The Times earned back much of its former respect from readers. But by the beginning of the Spanish-American War in 1898, it was still in debt, and its long-term viability was still in doubt. While The New York Journal and The New York World were able to use the profits reaped from selling sensationalized reports to send boats full of correspondents to the conflict, The Times published Associated Press articles because of a lack of funds.
After the war, struggling circulation drove Mr. Ochs to execute one of the riskiest business decisions of his career: He lowered the cost of the paper to 1 cent, from 3 cents.
Some of the paper's staff at the time argued that the new price would place The Times in the same disreputable category as the yellow papers. Unrelenting, Mr. Ochs insisted that the paper would remain committed to the standards he had set a few years earlier -- no fear, no favor -- and said he believed a large number of potential readers in the penny market would gladly switch over.
He was right. By the turn of the 20th century, circulation was almost 91,000, up from 9,000 when the paper was bought just four years earlier. Andrew Carnegie, one of the richest men alive, called the paper "the best cent's worth" in the world.

Cuomo's L-Train Save Resembles Plan Rejected Earlier by the M.T.A.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
The key to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's surprise decision this month to call off the L-train shutdown is a new repair plan that relies on a less disruptive approach to fixing the tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn, allowing work to be done on nights and weekends.
But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considered a similar idea nearly five years ago and determined that it raised serious safety concerns, including the potential for the spread of cancer-causing dust that could harm commuters and workers, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.
Both plans call for mounting heavy cables to the wall of a nearly century-old tunnel under the East River, rather than burying the cables in the wall.
But engineers warned in 2014 that the technique could harm the wall's lining, according to the documents obtained by The Times.
"Excessive anchor bolt penetrations for installing critical cables may damage the concrete lining and induce leakages," according to a report by the transit agency and Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering consultant now known as WSP that is leading planning for Mr. Cuomo's alternate plan.
Instead of closing the subway tunnel for 15 months, the new plan would limit construction work to one tube at a time on nights and weekends over a longer period of time.
But the earlier report raised concerns that the construction work could create silica dust, a hazardous mineral that would be difficult to remove during a short weekend closing. Exposure to silica dust can damage the lungs.
The engineers also said there was a "high risk" of not being able to restore train service on time every Monday morning.
On Tuesday, the authority's board was briefed on the new repair plan by WSP -- a meeting that turned into a lively debate over its merits. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, had called for the "emergency meeting."
A spokesman for the authority, Shams Tarek, defended the new repair plan and said it was "significantly different" from the 2014 approach. The new plan would hang the cables on racks, instead of affixing them directly to the tunnel wall, requiring 60 percent fewer bolts to hang the cables.
"The M.T.A. and WSP would never recommend a project that poses any risk to public safety," Mr. Tarek said in a statement.
Jerry Jannetti, a senior vice president at WSP, said the firm stood behind its new approach.
"We are confident that the frequency and depth of the bolt penetration will pose no risk to the tunnel lining," Mr. Jannetti said in a statement.
The new plan also removes a smaller amount of the concrete bench walls that can release silica dust, Mr. Jannetti said.
"Any issues related to silica dust will be managed by the contractor and overseen by an independent consultant, and will be safe for both workers and riders," he said.
Some board members have criticized Mr. Cuomo's secrecy in announcing the new approach without their input. The board must eventually approve the new plan, though no vote was taken on Tuesday.
A spokeswoman for the governor, Dani Lever, said in a statement: "The same consultant studied both options and said again today at a public hearing that this is a different design than the first option they studied, and hence they have a different opinion, just like an apple is not an orange."
At the board meeting, Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner, asked how the agency would handle silica dust and how long the construction work would last. Leaders on the project said efforts to contain the silica dust would depend on how much concrete is removed. The work could last 15 to 20 months, though the schedule is still being determined.
Ms. Trottenberg, who is also a board member, criticized the agency's decision to announce "shutdown averted" before talking to the board.
"Is the decision made?" she asked. "Do we have any actual role here?"
The authority's chairman, Fernando Ferrer, dared board members to express support for a full shutdown -- an option that has outraged L-train riders.
"Look, if you're for inconveniencing 275,000 people, say so!" Mr. Ferrer said.
The M.T.A. has become a punching bag over the last two weeks. Mr. Cuomo, complaining of its stodgy bureaucracy, said he wanted to "blow up the M.T.A." A piece on New York Magazine's website asked: "Is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority staffed by idiots?"
But the documents show that the agency, which had come under intense criticism for not thinking of the approach sooner, had considered other options and determined that a full shutdown was best.
In February 2015, a report by Jacobs, an engineering consultant, warned that "weekend construction is not acceptable," listing concerns over silica dust control and reliability. A chart showed the downsides of weekend closures, including higher labor costs and a longer construction period.
A final version of the Jacobs report released the next year changed how "silica dust control" during weekend work was rated from "not desirable" to "satisfactory."
Former subway leaders have criticized Mr. Cuomo's plan as being just a temporary fix for the tunnel, which was built in 1924 and damaged by floodwaters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
The new plan, developed by a team of engineers from Columbia and Cornell Universities, would hang the cables from the wall, instead of encasing them in a structure known as a bench wall.
Workers would remove damaged parts of the bench wall and secure other parts with a substance known as fiber reinforced polymer that could last 40 years. Rebuilding the bench walls, as the original plan called for, could last more than 80 years.
Carmen Bianco, the former president of New York City Transit, said he recalled attending meetings to discuss different approaches for the repairs, but the idea of hanging the cables was ruled out "very quickly" because of the tunnel's age. Mr. Bianco did not provide the documents to The Times.
"We all knew the worst thing we could do was a complete shutdown," Mr. Bianco said. "We knew what that would do to the neighborhoods and to the economy and to people trying to get to work. We couldn't find another scenario that was really safe and made sense."
Mr. Bianco, who argued in an Op-Ed in The Times last week that the revised plan had not been properly vetted, said Mr. Cuomo's plan could still be very disruptive since the L train is popular on nights and weekends. Trains would run every 20 minutes.
"If people continue to use it as normal, then it's going to be very crowded," he said.
The shutdown was set to begin on April 27. It is not clear when the work will begin now. Andy Byford, the subway's leader, supports Mr. Cuomo's plan, but called for an independent review and said he would not be "steamrolled" if that process takes a while.
Silica dust has emerged as a central concern. Removing parts of the concrete bench wall could create silica, a mineral that can cause an incurable lung disease or lung cancer if inhaled, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
The transit agency learned how to contain silica from rebuilding the Montague tunnel in 2014, according to the 2014 report on the L train. It requires "isolation of the work area," which is difficult during a weekend closing, the report said. One approach of wetting the dust to remove it was not foolproof, the report said.
"Mister and water-spray systems reduce airborne dust by about 50 percent" but do "not eliminate the hazard," the report said.
The debate over the L train also comes at a critical time for the transit agency. Mr. Byford introduced a plan to save the subway last May, but he needs Mr. Cuomo's help to pay for it. Mr. Cuomo has urged state lawmakers to pay for it by approving congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan.
Switching to a less ambitious plan in order to avoid having to shut down the L train would be a missed opportunity to fix the tunnel for the long haul, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.
"This is like delaying open-heart surgery," Mr. Moss said. "We don't know how long the stent is going to last."

Texto completo: Carol Channing, the raspy-voiced, saucer-eyed, wide-smiling actress who played lead roles in the original Broadway musical productions of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and "Hello, Dolly!" and delivered an Oscar-nominated performance in the 1967 movie musical "Thoroughly Modern Millie," died Jan. 15 at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 97.
Her publicist, B. Harlan Boll, announced the death and said she'd had two strokes in the past year.
Miss Channing was a gangly, dynamic, irrepressible presence on Broadway for more than seven decades. Platinum blond and standing 6 feet tall, she made her breakthrough impression on audiences and critics as the beguiling gold digger from Little Rock, Lorelei Lee, in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949).
Her rendition of two of the show's most memorable songs, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" and "A Little Girl From Little Rock," launched her career. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times called her portrait of Lee a "most fabulous comic creation."
The production ran for two years on Broadway and was followed by an extensive national tour. It was based on a 1920s book by Anita Loos, who wrote the play with Joseph Fields, and featured music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Leo Robin.
Miss Channing later told an interviewer that, given her unconventional look and voice, she was a nontraditional choice to play Lee.
"Anita Loos, who picked me when she wrote 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' for Broadway, said, 'Either get the cutest, prettiest little girl in town as Lorelei, or someone who can do a terrific satire,' " she said.
Miss Channing so seamlessly disappeared into the character of Lee that some of her collaborators questioned whether she could ever play another part as convincingly.
The role continued to dominate her career long after she appeared, to much praise, in musicals such as "Wonderful Town" (as a replacement for Rosalind Russell in 1954) and "The Vamp" (1955), a satire about a farm girl who becomes a silent-era screen star. She also was a frequent collaborator onstage with George Burns in an act that combined comedy, song and dance.
Then, in 1964, Miss Channing largely managed to wipe away the memory of Lorelei Lee with her starring role in "Hello, Dolly!" as an aggressive, shrewd, ever-optimistic matchmaker. Based on a Thornton Wilder play, "Hello, Dolly!" featured music and lyrics by Jerry Herman and a title song that became a pop standard. But it was Miss Channing who defined the show's spirit.
Playing Dolly Gallagher Levi, a life-embracing widow determined to remarry into money, she imbued the show with a depth of warmth and personality. Critic Walter Kerr, writing in the New York Herald Tribune, called her "glorious." Miss Channing triumphed over Barbra Streisand, then appearing on Broadway in the musical "Funny Girl," to win the Tony Award for best actress.
Her electric stage personality did not translate to a notable screen career. Her best-remembered Hollywood performance was in "Thoroughly Modern Millie," a musical set in the Roaring Twenties and starring Julie Andrews and Mary Tyler Moore. Miss Channing played an eccentric widow named Muzzy Van Hossmere.
Despite acclaim for her work in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and "Hello, Dolly!," Miss Channing was not asked to reprise either of the signature roles in the film versions. Marilyn Monroe was given Miss Channing's role in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," which was filmed in 1953; Streisand starred in the 1969 film production of "Hello, Dolly!"
Miss Channing resented being overlooked for the Hollywood productions and was particularly critical of having Streisand "steal" the role of Levi for the much-hyped film version. She was gleeful when the film tanked, later telling one interviewer, "Barbra is one of our great creative forces, but a barrel of laughs she ain't."
In 1974, she received another Tony nomination when she reprised the role of Lorelei Lee for the musical "Lorelei," which featured updated songs and a revised script from the earlier source material.
She was honored in 1995 for her work on Broadway with a Tony for lifetime achievement. About that time, she embarked on a worldwide tour of "Hello, Dolly!" - still in the leading role.
Washington Post culture critic Tom Shales wrote that Miss Channing's revival was not just a sentimental revisiting of bygone talent.
At 74, she was still captivating as Dolly, Shales wrote, and "seeing her do it with such grace and grandeur and pizazz is an exalting experience, sort of like witnessing Cal Ripken's shattering of Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game record or a phenomenal last-second swish by Michael Jordan."
Carol Elaine Channing was born in Seattle on Jan. 31, 1921, and grew up in San Francisco. Her father, a journalist and Christian Science lecturer, was a strong influence on her life. Miss Channing, who remained committed to Christian Science beliefs throughout her life, never drank or smoked. According to her 2002 autobiography, "Just Lucky I Guess," her mother revealed to her at 16 that her father was half black and warned her to keep the family racial heritage a secret.
Miss Channing's interest in the stage evolved from a bid for the student council when she was 7. Instead of giving a speech, she got up and did impressions of the teachers. Making students laugh convinced her of her talent for performing. She briefly attended Bennington College in Vermont before heading to New York to pursue acting.
In her memoir, she wrote of auditioning for Abe Lastfogel, president of the William Morris talent agency, and trying to impress him with "a simple ancient Gallic dirge, in obsolete Vercingetorix French," sung to the beat of a Haitian drum she brought along.
She added: "I sensed I was losing the great man's attention, so I said, 'Wait, Mr. Lastfogel, please. I have another song here that the girls at Bennington just love. It's a Haitian corn-grinding song rendered by the natives as they stomp out the kernels with their feet."
As he was rushing her to the door, she wrote, she broke into a Yiddish melody that convinced him of her promise. Lastfogel became her agent.
She first made a critical impression in the 1948 musical revue "Lend an Ear." One of her numbers, a satire of 1920s musicals, was praised as a highlight of the show and helped propel her to stardom. The production also introduced Miss Channing to choreographer Gower Champion, who as a director later cast her as Dolly Levi.
Miss Channing wrote in her memoir that Broadway producer David Merrick also played a role in snagging her the lead in "Dolly." Although the mercurial Merrick was a feared presence in the industry, Miss Channing said she was fond of him, to a point.
"He was darling," she once said of Merrick. "He was a great showman. He just wanted to be able to say 'I hate you' first."
Miss Channing's first two marriages, to writer Theodore Naidish and Canadian football player Alexander Carson, ended in divorce. She had a son from her second marriage, Channing Lowe, who became the political cartoonist for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.
Lowe took the last name of his mother's third husband, Charles Lowe, whom Miss Channing wed in 1956. Charles Lowe worked as his wife's manager and publicist, and he became known for conspicuous bursts of applause and laughter at every Channing performance. The pair were married for 42 years before a bitter split in 1998.
She publicly accused him of being physically abusive, misappropriating her money and having sex with her just twice during the marriage. He denied the charges and sued Miss Channing, alleging defamation, but he died the next year before they formally divorced.
In 2003, she married her childhood sweetheart, Harry Kullijian. He died in 2011. Survivors include her son.
Throughout her career, Miss Channing was known for her grit and commitment to her craft. When she developed an allergy to hair dye in the early 1960s, she began donning wigs to retain her blond bob. She also glued spiky fake lashes to her eyelids - so frequently, she said, it caused all of her natural eyelashes to fall out.
She played Dolly Levi more than 5,000 times and rarely missed a performance. Over the years, she reportedly performed the show with her arm in a sling, a patch over her eye and even with her foot in a cast.
"Performing is the only excuse for my existence," she told the Times in 1995. "What can be better than this?"

Texto completo: What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, Republican of Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn’t the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King’s words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said King’s argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has (vaguely) promised that disciplinary "action will be taken." If King is not at least censured, it will mean the House has no standards at all. And this, unfortunately, would be no surprise at all.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Donald Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn’t be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing. Add to this Trump’s attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "(expletive) countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Iowa Rep. Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments by fellow Republicans for questioning what was wrong with white supremacy in the U.S., and House Democrats took steps to admonish him.
House Republican leaders made the decision Monday night. He had previously sat on the Judiciary panel and Agriculture Committee, an important position for an Iowan.
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Monday that Mr. King's language has no place in the Republican Party and the decision by GOP leaders was unanimous.
Mr. King said his words were taken out of context in a newspaper interview, and argued that he was defending western civilization and not white supremacy or nationalism.
"Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," Mr. King said in a statement.
In an article published last week , the New York Times reported Mr. King said in an interview that he supports legal immigrants who fully assimilate to " 'the culture of America' based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe."
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization--how did that language become offensive?" Mr. King said in the newspaper interview. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
Two resolutions introduced separately by Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush of Illinois and Tim Ryan of Ohio would censure the lawmaker for the comments he made in the recent interview questioning why "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" are considered offensive. Mr. Rush's resolution would censure Mr. King for previous comments as well.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Democratic leadership decided Monday night to move forward with a resolution by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D., S.C.) that would formally disapprove of Mr. King's comments, but at a lower level than censure. The vote is likely Tuesday, a Democratic leadership aide said.
If one of the censure resolutions is passed by a simple majority, Mr. King would be forced to present himself at the front of the House Chamber for the pronouncement of the censure, which would be read out loud by Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr. King has a long history of criticizing immigrants and supporting white supremacists. His latest comments come as the new Democratic majority is focused on President Trump's comments about immigrants.
"It's perpetuating this division in the country that we don't need," said Mr. Ryan. "We need to start healing our country. He's done it enough times, in enough places, that I feel like it rises to the level of the House having to address it."
President Trump on Monday evening ignored questions about whether he thinks Mr. King should resign, according to a White House pool report. Earlier, he said he hadn't been following the story.
Ohio Republican Rep. Dave Joyce signed on to Mr. Ryan's censure.
Mr. King had previously faced little pushback from his fellow Republican lawmakers and leadership. GOP presidential candidates often seek his endorsement and Mr. Trump invited Mr. King to the Oval Office early in his presidency.
Mr. King was re-elected in November to a ninth term in his toughest fight in his stronghold Republican district, after top donors dropped him and Democrats put up a formidable opponent. He has already drawn a 2020 primary challenger, state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who cited Mr. King's "caustic nature" as a reason for his run.
Twenty-three members of the House have been censured for various forms of misconduct, including for using insulting language on the floor, assaulting other members and financial improprieties. No lawmaker has been censured for comments made to a newspaper.

CAN WOMEN'S MARCH SURVIVE DIVISION?

Texto completo: When the story spread last month that charges of anti-Semitism were behind a split at the top of the national Women's March, chapter leaders and activists across the country were so shocked they wondered if it was fake news fabricated to discredit their movement.
It wasn't. One of the national march's original organizers, Vanessa Wruble, claimed she had been forced out after the group's co-founders treated her with hostility because of her Jewish heritage a charge the others insisted was not true.
"It went through my head, we don't need this now, but at the same time, I did want to know if this was a serious allegation," said Kristen Podulka, a Palo Alto activist who attended the first Women's March on Washington in 2017 protesting newly-elected President Donald Trump.
With local Women's March chapters across the Bay Area and beyond gearing up for the third annual march Saturday, the rift is roiling the ranks and frustrating feminists who fear it could derail their momentum: A record 117 women were elected to Congress in November, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is taking star turns in the Oval Office during showdowns with Trump, and a record number of women are considering runs at the White House.
But suddenly, the organizers of the Women's March in San Jose were inundated with inquiries from women who weren't sure they were comfortable to march this year.
"It fractures the women's movement, and it plays to stereotypes for sure," said Jenny Higgins Bradanini, the lead organizer of the Women's March San Jose who said her "stomach sunk" when she first read the stories about the accusations. "Unfortunately, I think it had a big impact for a while. We would receive email messages from women asking if we are supporting anti-Semitic remarks."
At least one chapter, in New Orleans, canceled its event. Chicago also canceled its march, blaming financial concerns and a lack of volunteers, but said the conflict made the decision easier. And in New York, where the national leaders broke apart, two marches will go forward Saturday, one ostensibly celebrating diversity and the other led by Wruble's new group, March On, denouncing anti-Semitism.
Adding another layer of intrigue was the announcement this month that the official march in Humboldt County where more than 70 percent of the population is white was canceled when organizers said the group's leadership was "too white."
The conflicts are especially sensitive to feminists who remember the downfall of the women's liberation movement of the 1970s, dominated by white women who were criticized for alienating minority women with other viewpoints.
"When we look back, by silencing people, by making it a professional white women's movement, that weakened the movement profoundly," said Doreen Mattingly, San Diego State University's chair of the women's studies department.
The causes of the recent schism among the Women's March co-leaders in New York were more nuanced than this headline in the conservative Washington Times: "Mean girls: Farrakhan's influence tarnishes Women's March leadership team," referring to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
Wruble, a Brooklyn activist, said her Jewish heritage played a role when she was ousted by co-leaders Tamika Mallory, an African-American gun control activist, and Carmen Perez, a Latina who advocates criminal justice reform. Wruble told The New York Times that Mallory and Perez confronted her at the first organizing meeting by insisting that Jews played a role in the slave trade something the women deny and made offensive comments about the privilege of wealthy Jews.
Mallory and Perez have both denounced anti-Semitism, created a list of "unity principles" for the organization and apologized for the way they handled the conflict. Still, it didn't help when Mallory attended an event with Farrakhan, a divisive figure who is admired for his role in rehabilitating black men in prison but who has made numerous anti-Semitic remarks and whose Nation of Islam is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
In Oakland, Alison Mata, director of the Women's March there, said that in such a large movement, "there are going to be people who don't agree with one another. We really have to see the women's movement as being inclusive, that there are going to be some bumps in the road, but it's going to make us stronger and better together."
At each of the Bay Area marches, speakers from diverse backgrounds, including Jews, blacks and Latinos, will take the stage. More than 150,000 people are expected to march at events throughout the Bay Area, including as many as 70,000 in both San Francisco and Oakland and about 25,000 in San Jose.
In San Jose, Higgins Bradanini said march organizers have been reassuring participants that the group represents all women and condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and anti-Semitism.
"We're working hard to create an empowering, safe and impactful march for everyone January 19," Women's March San Jose organizers said in an email blast. "We've sought the advice and input of diverse community organizations for our programming and we hope you will join us."
In San Francisco, volunteers Martha Shaughnessy and Sophia Andary say stories that amplify conflicts within the organization make it seem that there are forces that want the women's movement to fail.
"People don't want this to work," Shaughnessy said, "and it makes for better news if women are in a cat fight" rather than putting together a broad coalition around social justice issues, from gender identity to immigration and housing costs.
Podulka, who wondered if the conflict was a "smear campaign," said she had considered joining the Washington march again, but the conflict "made me take pause," and for a variety of other reasons as well, she decided to attend the San Jose event instead.
"I'm not abandoning them in that sense. I'm still participating," she said. "Focusing on the bumps in the road hurts us more than the bumps themselves. We have to keep our momentum and keep our eye on the bigger picture."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump went to "extraordinary lengths" to keep details from his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin secret – even from officials within his own administration, The Washington Post reported this weekend, citing unnamed sources.
After meeting with Putin at the 2017 Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Trump took his interpreter's notes and told him not to discuss the meeting with anyone, including other U. S. officials, the Post reported.
The paper said Trump's handling of the Hamburg meeting was "part of a broader pattern by the president of shielding his communications with Putin from public scrutiny and preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States’ main adversaries. "
No detailed record exists from five of Trump's interactions with the Russian leader since taking office, the Post reported. It was unclear if that was the only time Trump took his interpreters' notes, but the paper said several administration officials have been unable to obtain a readout from his meeting last year with Putin in Helsinki.
New York Times: FBI investigated President Trump for possible secret Russian favors
Trump: NYT report on FBI fear that he worked for Russia is 'most insulting article' ever
Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was present at the meeting in Hamburg. The Post said Tillerson did not answer questions about Trump asking the interpreter to keep details of the meeting quiet, or if Trump took the interpreter's notes.
Fiona Hill, a senior Russia adviser on the National Security Council, and former State Department official John Heffern asked Trump's interpreter for more information about the Hamburg meeting, which is how they learned of the president's request to keep the details under wraps, the Post reported.
In a news conference after the meeting, Tillerson said Putin denied interfering in the 2016 election, but refused to say how Trump responded to the denial, per the Post. Officials told the Post that the only detail from the meeting that the interpreter did share was that Trump told Putin, "I believe you. "
Trump denied the report during an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on Saturday. He called the Post "basically the lobbyist for Amazon," because it is owned by the tech giant's CEO Jeff Bezos, a Trump critic.
"I’m not keeping anything under wraps," Trump said. "I couldn't care less. "
"I have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader. I have many one-on-one, nobody ever says anything about it," Trump told Pirro. "But with Putin, they say, 'Oh, what did they talk about?'"
"I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal. Anybody could have listened to that meeting. that meeting is up for grabs," Trump said, adding that he and Putin spoke about Israel and "lots of other things. "
Trump dismissed the "whole Russia thing" as a "terrible hoax" and said he won in 2016 because he "was a better candidate than Hillary Clinton," not because of collusion with Russian efforts to undermine her campaign.
"The fact is, I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily – 306-223, I believe," Trump said, referring to his performance in the Electoral College.
Democrats were alarmed by The Washington Post report.
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N. H. , has sought details from Trump's meetings with Putin and, after the 2018 Helsinki meeting, called for the president's interpreter to testify before Congress.
Trump's interpreter: Should she be compelled to tell what she heard during private meeting with Putin?
In August, she and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N. J. , sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter requesting records from that meeting, including the interpreter's notes. They cited the "extraordinary and, to our knowledge, unprecedented circumstances of President Trump’s two hour, one-on-one meeting with a leader identified as a threat to the United States by President Trump’s own National Security Strategy. "
"When he takes the interpreter's notes and wants to destroy them so no one can see what was said in written transcript, you know it raises serious questions about the relationship between this president and Putin," Sen. Dick Durbin said Sunday on ABC's "This Week. "
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. , said if the Post's report is accurate, Trump "broke all protocol. "
"The American government does not know what was discussed between Trump and Vladimir Putin in that, frankly, pathetic, embarrassing encounter where Trump was kowtowing on the world stage to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki," Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's "State of the Union. "
Analysis: Friends or foes? Trump's embrace of Putin prompts backlash
Helsinki transcript: White House says it was not 'malicious'
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. , plans to seek more information about Trump's meetings with Putin.
"It’s been several months since Helsinki and we still don’t know what went on in that meeting," Engel told the Post. "It’s appalling. It just makes you want to scratch your head. "
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said Sunday that he accepted Trump's denial and said those one-on-one meetings are part of the president's personal style.
"He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around," McCarthy said on "Face the Nation. "
When asked if thought Trump's interpreter should be asked to testify, McCarthy said, "I want this president to be able to build the relationship, even on a personal level, with all the world leaders. "

Iowan applauds Trump for bump stock ban

Texto completo: I opened my Jan. 3 issue of The Des Moines Register, flipped back to the opinion section and nearly fainted: The lead editorial was titled [Trump's bump stock ban a good start].
A mention of President Donald Trump in a positive light is rare; making it the first article on the opinion page even more atypical, and the headline was but the half of it. Toward the closing portion of the article, the authors wrote: "Now Trump has opened the door for common-sense reforms. Banning bump stocks is the most significant gun-control measure to come out of Washington in recent years."
That is worth pondering: "the most significant gun-control measure in recent years" and "opened the door for common-sense reforms," credited to President Donald Trump.
A rose to the Des Moines Register's editorial staff, and another to President Trump.
— Bill Shackelford, Des Moines
House Democrats should model respect The most important thing our new Democratic House of Representatives has to offer is to model respect. Members should model what it can look like when people work together for the common good, especially when they are in a majority. This is an opportunity to demonstrate what can happen when there is respect and thoughtfulness — even when it's not returned.
If our congressional representatives can rise above name-calling and shouting and disrespectful language, they will have given us a vision far greater than any legislation.
They will have given us back the best of who we can be, and the hope that we can solve problems together.
— Julie Powell-Mohr, Des Moines
King should look to WWII and Nazis' defeat In a recent interview with the New York Times, Rep. Steve King wonders when the phrase "white supremacist" became offensive [Rep. Steve King denies supporting white nationalism, supremacy after New York Times report].
My guess is sometime around 1945, when my father and millions of others his age defeated the Nazis.
It's hard to believe that a member of Congress supports the very beliefs that once threatened to take over the world. Our country fought against that fascist, white supremacist ideology in order to preserve our freedoms.
Thank goodness Republican challengers are stepping forward to replace this pathetic embarrassment of a politician.
— Jerry DenHartog, Clear Lake

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Hal Davis of Minneapolis:
1 "Marie and Rosetta," Park Square Theatre. Sister Rosetta Tharpe -- the gospel shouter and "godmother of rock 'n' roll" whose crackling guitar influenced Elvis, Little Richard and Johnny Cash -- got a rousing portrayal by Jamecia Bennett (with Michael May on guitar) in an electric performance of George Brandt's play with music.
2 "Envy," Joyann Parker. She has a Patsy Cline tribute show and, with her own blues band, echoes Janis Joplin. But Parker sounds best as herself. "Envy" captures the agony of sharing a lover: "Does her soul burn when she hears you sing? Does she feel her body ache when you leave?"
3 Amy Rigby, Minneapolis house concert. The queen of mod angst sang "Bob," a thank you to a mentor: "He taught me about Lou Reed/And the key of E." The most fun: "Keep It to Yourself," a sly, delicious ex-lover revenge fantasy.
Jon Bream of the Star Tribune:
1 Chance the Rapper apologizes for working with R. Kelly in 2015. After Lifetime's airing of "Surviving R. Kelly" discussing the singer's alleged abuse of women, and an article in Rolling Stone, Chance tweeted in part: "Any of us who ever ignored the R Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls. … I apologize to all of his survivors."
2 City Pages music editor Keith Harris ranks all 39 albums that landed at No. 1 in Billboard in 2018. With the flair of rock-critic dean Robert Christgau, Harris completed this daunting task with dedication, wit and enthusiasm.
3 Let Lady Gaga portray Freddie Mercury on film. That's what critic Wesley Morris proposed in the New York Times because she could truly channel the Queen star's flamboyant stage manner. And she can act (see "A Star Is Born").

Texto completo: As a percentage of its population, Iowa sent more troops to fight in the Civil War than any other state. Iowans fought on the side of the Union against the Confederate South. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States and the commander in chief of Union forces, was the first Republican president.
So it seems odd (to me, at least) that a Republican congressman from Iowa would display a Confederate flag on his desk. But that's what Rep. Steve King did as recently as 2016. (He removed it only after it was revealed that a cop killer had waved a Confederate flag at an Iowa high school football game.)
I'm not one of those people who think everyone who displays a Confederate flag is necessarily a racist or a bigot. But I usually reserve the benefit of the doubt for actual Southerners who are nodding to tradition or nostalgia.
If there's one thing King has not earned it's the benefit of the doubt. Even accounting for an IQ that seems to be in conflict with the idea that white people are superior, the man understands what he's up to.
In an interview with the New York Times published Thursday, King asked: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
The obvious answer is because he needed an education -- and still does.
At the 2016 Republican National Convention, King responded to the suggestion that the GOP needs to appeal to Americans other than old white people: "I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"
Contrary to the prattle of white nationalists and supremacists (and, interestingly, various left-wing theorists and black nationalists such as Louis Farrakhan), Western civilization is not synonymous with whiteness. Many of the people King would count as white today were not considered white by various giants of American white nationalism and white supremacy. Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, Greeks et al. weren't "whites" at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Steve Kings of that era were terrified of non-white immigrants.
In 1911, the joint congressional Immigration Commission completed a 41-volume report that included the Dictionary of Races or Peoples, a pseudoscientific grab bag containing "a motley compendium of ethnic stereotypes, skin complexion, head shape, and other hardy perennials of the race science literature," according to Princeton historian Thomas Leonard in his vital book "Illiberal Reformers."
Bohemians had heavy brains. Southern Italians were too "excitable" and "impulsive" to adapt to organized society. Slavs were overly prone to "periods of besotted drunkenness" and "unexpected cruelty." Germans from the Tyrol region were too broad-headed to be of desirable stock.
In fairness, "white" wasn't a term of art back then, so white supremacists were actually Aryan or Nordic or English (not Irish!) supremacists. But you get the point.
Then there's the notion that non-whites haven't made worthy contributions to civilization. Leave aside that by not counting Italians (sorry, Galileo and Da Vinci!), East Europeans (sucks for you, Copernicus!) or Jews (Einstein? Good riddance) as white, you're bequeathing many of the glories of civilization to non-whites. But even with the most expansive definition of "white" possible, how do we account for the fact that Chinese, Ottoman and Arab societies were leaps and bounds ahead of Europe for centuries? The Chinese invented the compass, paper, movable type, mechanical clocks, iron smelting and countless other innovations when "white" Europe was a barbaric backwater. And let's not forget that Christianity is a cultural import from that great melting pot that was the Middle East.
One is reminded of Benjamin Disraeli's famous retort to an Irish Catholic parliamentarian's anti-Semitic attack on his heritage: "Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon."
But this is the wrong way to respond to King's bigotry. Among the best ideas and ideals of Western, Christian and, most importantly, American civilization is that we are supposed to judge people on their individual merits, not keep score based on their ancestry.
This vision was central to the creation of the Republican Party, which is why it's so dismaying that Rep. King calls himself one.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Developer with Walton family ties plans hotel in Locust Street YMCA building

Texto completo: A Colorado developer with ties to the Walton family of Walmart has purchased the old downtown YMCA building at 1528 Locust Street and has plans to redevelop it into a hotel.
The 10-story building, built in 1926, was vacated by the athletic club when it moved to the MX building at Sixth and Locust streets in 2017. The sale, first reported by the St. Louis Business Journal, closed late last month. St. Louis property records indicate the building sold for $3.1 million. The building is not collateral for a loan, and records indicate it was purchased with cash.
The new owner last month applied for a building permit that lists the new use of the building as a hotel.
The Gateway Region YMCA owned the portion of the property where it operated. The long-vacant upper floors were owned by Sonny Property #1 LLC, which listed Frank William Bonan II, part of the family that runs Peoples National Bank, as a member.
The new owner is a Delaware limited liability company that Tina Steiner, who lists a Bentonville, Ark., address in real estate documents, signs for. She also is listed in the Colorado business registration for Nuovo RE, a Denver real estate development firm whose website says it focuses on historic restoration and describes itself as a "socially and environmentally conscious group." It says it focuses on secondary markets with "opportunities for urban revitalization."
A representative from the company did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Nuovo RE's Hotel Revival, which opened in Baltimore's Mount Vernon neighborhood last year, earned a recent mention from the New York Times. The newspaper said that the project was financed by Alice Walton Proietti, a granddaughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton.
Nuovo RE's president, Michael Everett, told the Times it was the type of market the firm targeted: "urban redevelopment space."
Already, construction fences surround St. Louis' old YMCA and indicate St. Louis-based HBD Construction is working on the building. But a timeline and the number of rooms planned is unclear.
The Italian Renaissance Revival building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, so the project could be eligible for state historic tax credits.
Designed by the once-prominent St. Louis architecture firm LaBeaume & Klein, it received a major piece of its funding from Brown Shoe founder George Warren Brown following his death, according to its National Register nomination.
The YMCA organization wanted the building to be centrally located and near working men "in need of 'character-building,'" according to its National Register report.
The report quoted a 1953 history of the YMCA organization that mentioned the Locust Street location: "It is said that when the building was dedicated, the key was thrown into the Mississippi River and that the doors have never been closed night or day."
That streak ended in later years. Though the gym and athletic facilities continued operating there until two years ago, the upper floor apartments became a major nuisance, with drugs, prostitution and burglaries plaguing residents.
In 2007, the city ordered the closure of the Centenary Towers apartment complex, as it was known. The owner of the apartments, which had acquired the upper eight floors in 1997, defaulted on a loan and the upper floors remained unused during the YMCA's last decade in the building's lower floors.
In 2014, a sprinkler burst and flooded several floors. A developer's plans to rehab the upper floors never materialized.
If the plans for a hotel do come together, it would be the latest downtown lodging project. Developer Restoration St. Louis recently opened Hotel St. Louis in the Union Trust building on Olive Street. Just to the east, an 86-room Hotel Indigo is underway, backed by Tennessee-based developer ViaNova Development . And next to City Museum on Washington Avenue, Milwaukee-based Fe Equus Development is redoing the International Shoe building .

Texto completo: Andrew Rawson's cellphone beeped as he worked on a video in Traliant's New Jersey office.
The message wasn't from a friend or a telemarketer.
It was an email from a company seeking assistance from Traliant, which offers training courses and interactive videos about harassment in the workplace.
"We serve companies with 20 people, and other companies with 100,000 people," said Rawson, co-founder and chief learning officer at Traliant, which this past spring moved from its Montclair headquarters into a larger space in East Hanover.
"A year after #MeToo, preventing sexual harassment in the workplace remains in the spotlight and one of the top priorities for human resources professionals and their organizations," said Carole Walters, an editor at Traliant.
Walters said the company offers training on preventing discrimination and harassment in office settings, and has been expanding it to include to hospitality, industrial, manufacturing and health care sectors.
At Traliant, the goal is to teach people about laws on sexual and other types of harassment and how to behave accordingly, Rawson said.
"Before Traliant, [employers] trained you on the laws but had no idea if that made a difference in anybody's behavior," Rawson said.
"Now we're showing people how they can disrupt a harassment situation," Rawson said. "We're showing them how they should report a sexual harassment situation, knowing it's not easy to do that."
CEO and co-founder Mike Pallatta said training is a way to "create the conversation and raise awareness" about what is and isn't acceptable behavior in the workplace.
"Employees are being more sensitive to bad behavior," said Pallatta. "Little comments that you'd think were fine five years ago may not be today. There are things you have to be careful talking about."
Sexual harassment is unlawfully harassing someone based on a person's sex and can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and verbal or physical harassment that has a sexual nature, Rawson explained.
Harassment is unwelcome conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability or genetic information, which are characteristics protected under federal law.
"People tend to be unclear about these definitions because legally, only members of the 'protected classes' are protected from harassment or discrimination," Rawson said in an email. "However, in practical terms, no organization wants their people to harass or discriminate against anyone for any reason."
Lauren Hersh, national director of World Without Exploitation, a movement that aims to curb sexual exploitation and human trafficking, said people today have more of an understanding about what sexual harassment is than they did five to 10 years ago.
"There's been such a transformation in our culture," Hersh said. "I don't think we're there yet but we're on our way.
"We're talking about these issues in a way we hadn't been five years ago," she noted.
It was a little over a year ago that the New York Times broke a story alleging decades of sexual harassment of multiple women by media mogul Harvey Weinstein.
A litany of cases followed. Host Matt Lauer was fired from the "Today" show amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations. Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued her boss Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and won a $20 million settlement. And former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly wrote a memoir, "Settle for More," detailing her experiences involving sexual harassment at Fox News.
Rosemarie Arnold, an attorney in Fort Lee, says the #MeToo Movement and "the Hollywood éxposé of people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby" pushed victims to come forward.
"When it happens in Hollywood, people actually believe it's real, which is interesting," said Arnold, who has worked on about 250 sexual harassment cases over the past decade.
Arnold said her experience has been that individuals often hesitate to come forward because they are told by a supervisor or their harasser that nobody will believe them.
Now, she said, "Women and men feel a lot more comfortable coming forward and making accusations. They feel they'll be believed and that action will be taken to help them out," Arnold said.
A tax law affecting settlements went into effect last year, and may be problematic for employers and employees, said Montclair-based attorney Leslie Farber.
Farber said employers can no longer deduct settlement payments in sexual harassment cases that are considered confidential. Employees must pay taxes on the full amount of the settlement, including the attorney fees, which were formerly deductible, Farber said.
Farber said New Jersey employees are pushing to get rid of forced arbitration, which limits workers' right to discovery.
"This puts the employee at a significant disadvantage because so much of the information the employee needs to prove her or his case is in the employer's hand," Farber said in an email.
There is also a bill in the state Legislature that would prohibit non-disclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases, Farber said.
For Traliant, the #MeToo movement has presented an opportunity to get a message out about prevention.
The mindset people have about sexual harassment is changing, say Traliant's co-founders.
"If someone says, 'Can I meet you for a drink?' and the person says 'Sure,' we'll train on that with a video. If the person says 'no,' we'll train on that, too," said Rawson.
Pallatta said, "We'll integrate the company's policy into the video."
"It's about coming to an understanding of what really is acceptable behavior and having an appropriate amount of sensitivity," Pallatta said.

Texto completo: At the age of 4, Lada Gaga wasn't bringing down the house for 30,000 roaring fans.
In fact, Stefani Germanotta didn't even become the Gaga we know until she'd studied and practiced music for years. Just like every other kid who picks up an instrument, she took up piano and plunked out an uneven version of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."
Pablo Picasso didn't begin crafting timeless masterpieces with his first paint set. He probably scrabbled out an uneven stick figure, as many of us did when we first attempted art.
The masters of any craft – from music to business – are not born titans. Their mastery comes through the combination of hard work, persistence, study, discipline and sacrifice. Yes, innate talent plays some role, but far less than most people believe. It's the countless hours toiling away, learning and practicing, which lead to mastery.
Why, then, do we put so much pressure on ourselves to be perfect at our early attempts at something new? Experienced pros at the top of their game make it look easy and natural, but that only comes as the result of years of effort and refinement.
Stumbling early is part of the process. As I learned jazz guitar, I devoted hundreds of hours and made countless mistakes. There were many days I wanted to quit; many times I felt I had no talent. But it was the persistent force of will and the tenacity to succeed that allowed me to eventually make it look easy. It was a 20-year journey, not an overnight success.
As you embark upon a new path, or work to elevate an existing skill, keep in mind that persistence and grit will play a far greater role in your eventual success than any raw talent you possess.
We've all felt discouraged when not progressing as fast as we'd like, but let's flip that story. Those moments of doubt are merely signals that a breakthrough is near.
Forge ahead and learn through the frustration. Before you know it, people will point to you as the master, exclaiming how easy you make it look and what a natural you are. Your first, second, or fifteenth attempts aren't what you'll be remembered for. Press on, and your defining moment will be revealed in conjunction with your consistent pursuit.

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip.
"This is going to be something," said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra's viola players. "This is a freight train."
Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America's most admired classical music venues.
This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.
Conductor Franz Welser-Most raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.
Inside the hall
When the orchestra's leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America built skyscrapers, Cleveland's steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.
The city's population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.
Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.
As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.
A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall, which didn't quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall's Georgian neoclassical exterior is "Pomp and Circumstance" at 23 beats a minute.
But inside, it's "Rhapsody in Blue" meets "King Tut." Once you step into the grand foyer, you're swallowed by a mashup of art deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.
It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm. Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in California, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929.
Yet John didn't hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth's personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today. It opened in 1931.
The intricate, lacelike aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth's wedding dress.
"He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from," Hoy told me.
The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.
As for Cleveland's orchestra, the musicians never relinquished the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January last year a New York Times headline proclaimed that "At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America's Best." (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)
Bela Bartok, Leonard Bernstein, Benny Goodman, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich - all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.
It remains the orchestra's home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, Cleveland Pops Orchestra concerts and other events.
The legacy
On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue's fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.
The music began with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I'm no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.
The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.
The next piece was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 - a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.
After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, composed in 1928.
Before beginning, Welser-Most addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us "to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath."
Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming timpani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending - a beginning as dark and alarming as the night's first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.
From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.
At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.
At Cleveland's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.
If you go

Texto completo: New York City during World War II was an island of intrigue: It had spy rings, fascist sympathizers, U-boats lurking offshore. The most populous and diverse metropolis on the planet, it was home to more Jews than any other city in the world, more Germans than anywhere else outside Germany, nearly as many Italians as Rome and more African Americans than any other U.S. city. It also virtually ran the federal government, thanks to Franklin D. Roosevelt's practice of filling his administration and the numerous agencies he created with New York's best and brightest. The city also contributed and trained more servicemen and women than any other American metropolis and was home to the world's busiest port, the nation's major media outlets and the early headquarters of the Manhattan Project, which would finally bring the war to its horrific conclusion.
In "Victory City: A History of New York and New Yorkers During World War II," John Stausbaugh delivers both a macro- and microhistory of a city at war. Strausbaugh, the author of "The Village: 400 Years of Beats and Bohemians, Radicals and Rogues, a History of Greenwich Village" and "City of Sedition: The History of New York City During the Civil War," provides not only a broad social and cultural portrait of World War II New York but also
a sweeping panorama of close-up scenes, short profiles and mini-narratives. He begins at the World's Fair in Flushing Meadows in 1939 and ends with the building of the United Nations headquarters on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in 1948. In between, we witness tens of thousands gathering at Madison Square Garden for the largest pro-Nazi rally in the United States, Madison Avenue's admen shifting from selling cars to selling the war, Wall Street banks funding the Nazi war machine and an off-course B-25 bomber crashing into the Empire State Building. Even the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), forerunner to the CIA, grew out of a secret New York espionage unit composed of FDR's buddies.
On his radio program, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia gave conservation tips to New Yorkers hoping to make their sacrifices a model for the rest of the country, the New York Times ran full-page ads of Ben Hecht lambasting U.S. inaction in the face of Nazi atrocities against Jews, and the New York Daily News spread vicious rumors about members of the Women's Army Corps (WACS) and Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) spreading venereal disease. As Strausbaugh puts it, "The hysteria about sexualized females spreading physical and moral corruption would play a large hand in the country's wholesale retreat to 'traditional,' desexualized feminine ideals after the war."
Strausbaugh brings a dizzying array of events to life through the individuals at their heart. We meet a zoot-suited Malcolm Little, who later changed his name to Malcolm X, creatively avoiding the draft and witnessing the 1943 Harlem riots;
and cartoonist Theodor Geisel, better known later as Dr. Seuss, relying on racial stereotypes to depict war-time Japanese for the New York newspaper PM. We follow the life of Dorothy Thompson, the first American journalist expelled from Nazi Germany, who became one of the loudest anti-fascist voices of the era. There's Fritz Kuhn, who led the largest pro-Nazi group in the United States and built a Hitler-inspired Aryan community on Long Island; and Irish Catholic Father Coughlin, who spread pro-fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-communist conspiracy theories in his nationally syndicated radio sermons. We encounter William Patrick Hitler (one of the Führer's nephews), who came to the United States, served in the Navy, then virtually disappeared. Strausbaugh explains, "He moved to Patchogue out on Long Island under the assumed name William Stuart-Houston, married a German woman, quietly raised a family, and died in 1987." There are also the hapless German would-be saboteurs who were dropped off by a U-boat, then went on a shopping spree at Macy's, and the slew of spies (not only the Rosenbergs) passing atomic secrets to the Soviets. The parade of New York's wartime characters seems unending and always fascinating.
Any one of the vignettes or mini-bios Strausbaugh presents could provide the material for an entire book - or a Hollywood film. Indeed, most already have. The profiles and stories in "Victory City" mostly have already been told. No matter. The book will delight armchair historians, providing an entertaining overview of the era and a gateway to more in-depth studies of the intriguing figures and stories. (The bibliography provides a useful list of such works.) Strausbaugh's galloping prose makes "Victory City" a compulsively engaging read. If his attention to detail occasionally slows things down, never fear: The pace picks up again on this compelling ride through wartime New York and beyond.
Anne Boyd Rioux is the author of three books, most recently "Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of 'Little Women' and Why It Still Matters."

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand
Nov. 8, 2018, on CBS' The Late Show With Stephen Colbert
ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appears all but certain to launch a 2020 presidential campaign soon.
Gillibrand, a Democrat, has keyed in on the Rensselaer County city of Troy as a potential headquarters for a 2020 campaign, not far from her home in Brunswick, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Next weekend, Politico reports, Gillibrand plans on traveling to Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are a key first step in the primary season.
And she has been staffing up for a potential bid, selecting a campaign manager, communications directors and other key positions for the coming campaign, according to various reports.
A spokesman for Gillibrand did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Mulling a run for months Gillibrand has been publicly mulling a presidential run since cruising to reelection in November.
She is expected to formally announce her run in the coming days or weeks.
Long rumored to have aspirations for higher office, she first publicly confirmed she was considering a 2020 bid on Nov. 8, two days after winning reelection in New York.
"I believe right now that every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans, so I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought of consideration," Gillibrand said then on CBS' The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.
Gillibrand, 52, has been New York's junior senator since 2009, when she was selected by then-Gov. David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had become secretary of state.
She's been easily reelected three times since then — in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Prior to that, she was a congresswoman representing an Albany-area district from 2007 until she was appointed senator.
Pledged to serve a full Senate term Gillibrand's apparent run comes despite repeatedly pledging to serve a full six-year term in the Senate, which would run through 2024.
Her most public pledge came during an October 2018 debate.
"I will serve my six-year term," she said then.
That led to a quick rebuttal from Republican opponent Chele Farley: "Honestly, I don't believe that."
The New York Times reported Friday that Gillibrand had hired Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as her 2020 communications director.
Her campaign staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her chief of staff in the Senate, and Dan McNally, who worked for Senate Democrats, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Both reports cited unnamed people who were familiar with the hirings.

Free Credit 'Lock' Is Ending. What Now?

Texto completo: Consumers affected by Equifax's huge data breach in 2017 may need to re-establish protections on their credit report if they "locked" their files as part of the company's free credit-monitoring offer.
People who accepted Equifax's offer after the breach have been notified that the free service, TrustedID Premier, will expire at the end of January.
If subscribers locked their Equifax credit files using the service to prevent the opening of fraudulent accounts, the locks will automatically lift when TrustedID expires, according to Equifax. The locks will also end if, before Jan. 31, the consumer enrolls in a similar service that breach victims are being offered as an alternative.
The upshot? Consumers who want to keep the lock on their Equifax credit files have to use a different product -- like the company's free "lock & alert" service, the company suggests.
Perplexed? You're not alone. Several people contacted The New York Times about the change. Notices emailed to Equifax subscribers do explain the lock issue, if readers click through to a question-and-answer page. But some subscribers and consumer advocates worry that people may not absorb the details and remain unaware that they have to relock their Equifax credit report. Credit locks are marketed by credit bureaus as a convenient way to prevent lenders and others from obtaining your credit report without your knowledge.
"There's an opportunity for consumers to be confused," said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. If consumers don't relock their files -- and if they haven't used another option, known as a security freeze -- "they're still going to be very vulnerable," he said.
Christina Tetreault, a staff attorney at Consumers Union who specializes in financial services, said the situation illustrated why the best way to guard against account fraud is to place a security freeze -- not a lock -- on your files at all three credit bureaus.
Federal law now requires credit bureaus to offer security freezes free of charge, and they're much simpler to set up than in the past, Ms. Tetreault said. A freeze accomplishes the same thing as a lock, she said, but with a freeze, your rights are defined by law. With credit locks, she said, the bureaus set the rules.
"With a freeze," she said, "the power belongs to the consumer."
Equifax initially told at least some subscribers that it would extend free credit monitoring through TrustedID Premier, according to emails shared with The Times. But later, it switched to an offer of a second year through the credit bureau Experian, a competitor. Some subscribers may already have switched, but the deadline to enroll for the free extra year is Jan. 31, according to a notice Equifax sent to subscribers. (Experian normally charges a monthly fee for its service, called IDnotify.)
An Equifax spokeswoman, Nancy Bistritz-Balkan, said Equifax would continue to offer credit monitoring tools to consumers, but had a "strategic relationship" with Experian to provide a year of free credit monitoring to breach victims through IDnotify.
It's unclear how many people may be affected by the lock issue. Ms. Bistritz-Balkan declined to say how many consumers had enrolled in free credit monitoring after the breach, which compromised the personal information, including Social Security numbers, birth dates and other sensitive details, of more than 145 million people.
Edward Steen, a retired patent lawyer in New York, said he had subscribed to the free credit monitoring after the Equifax breach, and had started to fill out an online form to get the extra free year from Experian. But since he and his wife had each placed security freezes on their credit files, he decided he didn't need it. "What's the point?" he asked.
Credit monitoring services notify subscribers of activity in their credit files, which are maintained by the three big credit bureaus (the third is TransUnion), as a way to flag possible fraud or identity theft. The services may also offer a package of other related features.
Mr. Stephens said he was puzzled by Equifax's move to offer consumers credit monitoring from a competitor. Still, he said he saw no harm in using free credit monitoring -- as long as it covered all three bureaus and consumers realized that it was a "reactive" service that notified them of activity in their credit file after it occurred, rather than preventing it.
Here are some questions and answers about credit protection:
What if I subscribed to TrustedID Premier but have a security freeze on my Equifax credit file, rather than a lock?
The expiration of credit monitoring from TrustedID Premier won't affect credit freezes -- just locks. "If your Equifax credit report is frozen and not locked," Equifax told subscribers, "the security freeze will stay in place."
How do I establish a credit freeze?
To freeze your credit files, visit the website of each credit bureau (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) and follow the instructions to register and apply the freeze. You'll also get instructions on how to thaw the freeze if you want to apply for a loan or a credit card; details vary by bureau.
What other steps can I take to protect myself from identity fraud?
A good practice is to check your credit file periodically for any suspicious activity. You are entitled to a free copy each year from the three credit bureaus at www.annualcreditreport.com.

What they’re saying about Gase, Jets

Texto completo: How Adam Gase’s hiring by the Jets is being received by the New York media and selected others:
Manish Mehta, New York Daily News: He’s smart, confident and doesn’t put up with any B.S. He realizes that a rotten culture will destroy everything. He’s got no time for knuckleheads. The Jets hit a home run by hiring Adam Gase to be their next coach.
… The reality from talking to people in the know is that Gase was a terrific communicator with players with a keen understanding of player psychology designed to build confidence.
Joe Benigno, WFAN: History tells you they got it wrong. Three or four years from now, maybe sooner, why would I not think we will be here in the same position, looking for a new coach? Except this time we’ll be looking for a new general manager.
Brian Costello, New York Post: It helps to have references when applying for a job. Adam Gase had an influential one. Legendary quarterback Peyton Manning called Jets CEO Christopher Johnson on Tuesday night to recommend Gase for the team’s head-coaching opening. A day later, the Jets hired him.
Al Iannazzone, Newsday: The Jets have made their coaching choice, and it’s probably not the popular one among their long-suffering fans.
Rich Cimini, ESPN: The New York Jets joined the new craze in the NFL, hiring their version of Sean McVay. Actually, their new coach is an older, dented version of the Los Angeles Rams’ so-called genius. Say hello to Adam Gase, who was McVay before McVay.
… What happened the past two seasons can’t be ignored, though, because Gase presided over 6-10 and 7-9 seasons. He’s supposed to be an offensive guru, but he didn’t do a very good job of guru-ing because the Dolphins went from 24th to 25th to 31st in total offense.
… There also are questions about Gase’s ability to interact with people. He reportedly clashed with Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, and there were reports about player dissension in the locker room. People who know Gase say he can rub people the wrong way because he’s brutally direct. He has high standards and he doesn’t compromise. He doesn’t suffer fools gladly. If you’re not on board, you’re out. That probably explains why so many high-profile players were jettisoned last offseason by the Dolphins.
Zach Schonbrun, New York Times: Gase’s résumé stands out among those of past Jets coaches. He is the franchise’s first coach to be hired with any prior head coaching experience since Bill Parcells in 1997 and the first with an offensive background since Rich Kotite in 1995.
… On Dec. 31, (chairman Christopher) Johnson said he believed the Jets’ opening was an attractive one, and not only because of (Sam) Darnold. “If you win here, you’re a freaking legend,” Johnson said. “That counts for something.”
Gase will get the chance to find out.
Michael Nania, Gang Green Nation : This is a tough hire to sell. There’s no other way to put it. However, I’ll give Gase this. I do think he has done a fairly impressive job maximizing his quarterbacks at almost every step of the way. Everywhere he went, quarterbacks either set career bests, won more often than they should have, or did both.
Has Gase developed a quality young quarterback yet? No. However, has he gotten a legitimate chance to? Who do you think he should have developed? The mediocre 28-year old in Miami who already had four seasons under his belt (and actually did progress under Gase prior to injury)? Tebow?
Will Manso, WPLG-Channel 10 in Miami (via Twitter) : Reading twitter tonight proves to me what I already knew. People outside of South Florida really haven’t watched the Dolphins in the last few years. Only in that world does, “Adam Gase: Offensive Genius” exist.
Mike Greenberg, ESPN (via Twitter): I will say, based on what I know of Adam Gase: The #Jets better win fast. Because his personality and our media and fan base are a highly combustible mix if things don’t go well.

Fed chief for Boston leans to optimistic

Texto completo: BOSTON -- The head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on Wednesday advocated for the nation's central bank to be patient and wait out some of the recent volatility in the markets before charting a new course on monetary policy.

Speaking to the Boston Economic Club to give his annual economic outlook, Boston Fed President and CEO Eric Rosengren said it is critical to determine whether recent financial market sentiment -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 12.5 percent from October to December -- is too pessimistic, too optimistic or about right. At the same time, economic forecasts are predicting growth "somewhat above potential," he said.

"My own assessment is closer to the relative optimism of many economic forecasters than it is to the more pessimistic outlook suggested by recent declines in financial markets," Rosengren said, according to his prepared remarks.

The Fed chief said he thinks the economic outlook is "actually brighter than the outlook one might infer from recent financial market movements" and that real growth will "remain solid enough to tighten the U.S. labor market somewhat" in 2019.

"Economic growth was quite strong in 2018, and some of that strength is likely to carry forward," Rosengren said. "Furthermore, the engine behind the good growth level in 2018 was the consumer. There are many reasons to believe the consumer is still engaged and willing to spend -- employment growth remains strong, wage growth rates are rising, the savings rate is high, and consumer confidence remains high by historical standards."

With the contrast between the pessimism reflected in the markets lately and mostly optimistic economic forecasts in mind, Rosengren on Wednesday argued for the Federal Reserve to hold off on adjusting monetary policy or dictating a future course until there is more available data to contribute to the decision.

"Yet given the reduced certainty I have about my forecast -- in light of the slowing abroad and volatile financial markets -- in my view, the appropriate stance for monetary policy is, for now, to not have a bias on moving policy in either direction until there is greater clarity around economic trends here and abroad," he said. "The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy seems appropriate for now, and can patiently observe future economic developments."

Rosengren's message was echoed Wednesday by Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. According to the New York Times, Evans delivered a similar speech in Illinois on Wednesday in which he said, "I feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments."

Rosengren and Evans are both current members of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on key monetary policy decisions like whether to raise or lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates.

After the committee raised the benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent at its December meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the central bank expected it would raise rates twice in 2019.

No Kevin Hart, no problem? It's been 30 years since the Oscars went without a host

Resumen: Kevin Hart says he's definitely out, but the last time the Academy Awards went host-less was 30 years ago. Can the Oscars pull it off this time?

Texto completo: Please welcome your host for this year's Academy Awards . . . Nobody?
Comedian Kevin Hart has made it clear it won't be him, saying he's "over" the drama. And now Variety is reporting that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to eschew having one host for the Feb. 24 telecast in favor of recruiting stars to introduce segments, something that hasn't happened in 30 years
USA TODAY has reached out to the Academy for comment.
First, a recap of how we got here: Hart officially stepped down Dec. 6, hours after announcing he'd landed the gig, over his past homophobic comments. Hart, 39, had initially refused to apologize, though he later relented.
The "Night School" star appeared to be reconsidering his decision after a heartfelt plea from Ellen DeGeneres last week but he officially put the idea to rest Wednesday on "Good Morning America," telling Michael Strahan, "I'm not hosting the Oscars this year. "
He continued, "It's hard to predict what can happen and I don't want people to think there's a thing between me and the Academy, because there isn't," he said. "The Academy, they're amazing people, the offer was made, it was received, I was excited, things happened, it didn't work out the way it should have. "
The Academy never confirmed DeGeneres' claim that it wanted him back as host.
Now, the Academy's reported decision to go without a host comes after several past hosts insisted they had no interest in the gig.
Chris Rock, who emceed the show in 2005 and 2016, and DeGeneres, who hosted in 2007 and 2014, indicated they didn't want to come back.
"I'm not doing that, (expletive)! You're not getting me," Rock said Monday at the New York Film Critics Circle dinner, suggesting that his favorite host, three-timer Steve Martin, come to the Academy's rescue. "You were the best. "
In mid-December, DeGeneres told USA TODAY, "I don't want to say 'no,' because I've said 'no' before and then I did. But it's probably a 99. 9 percent no. "
She added, "Look, it's a thankless job, and coming on this late, it feels like that's a really tough position to (be in). "
DeGeneres then suggested the path that the Academy has chosen.
"I think they should just have multiple hosts and multiple people introducing categories because it's not about the host anyway," she said. "No matter how well you do, it's really just about the performances and the awards. That's all anybody really cares about, so that's probably the best way to go. "
But is it? Let's review.
Choosing the show's host early to prepare movie's biggest night of the year has been a priority for the Academy. In 2011, there was mild panic when Eddie Murphy dropped out of hosting the Oscars in November, with months to go before the broadcast. Veteran Billy Crystal was quickly recruited to fill in to host his ninth Oscars.
Tom O'Neil, author of the book "Movie Awards," says putting the show together in weeks is workable in the industry town, and downplayed any panic in correcting the host situation.
"These are seasoned professionals. They know how to rise to the situation," he says, "Hollywood is all about cliffhangers. And now we have a big cliffhanger in our own awards show. "
IMDb. com correspondent Dave Karger agrees, noting the pressure modern hosts come under.
"If the telecast producers are able to come up with enough memorable moments and inspired presenter combinations, the ceremony won’t suffer without a host," Karger says. "Given the Kevin Hart drama and the fact that most Oscar hosts catch more flak than praise these days, it makes sense to go without one this time. "
Still, last time the Academy Awards went host-less was 1989. That year, the show opened with an 11-minute musical number headlined by Rob Lowe and Snow White. It's widely regarded as one of the worst openers in Oscar history. A second number, "The Stars of Tomorrow," featuring Patrick Dempsey, Blair Underwood, Corey Feldman, Ricki Lake and Christian Slater, didn't fare much better.
The next day, 17 Hollywood icons including Paul Newman and Julie Andrews signed an open letter calling the 1989 telecast "an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion-picture industry. "
Lowe himself gave an interview to The New York Times this past December, calling his opening number "a huge mistake. "
That show was also the first and last time Allan Carr produced the Oscars, though several of his other innovations remain part of the show today, including an emphasis on the red carpet (since spun off into its own pre-show), recruiting top-name designers to dress nominees and presenters, and introducing the most famous phrase uttered on the show: "And the Oscar goes to . . . "
Oh, and it was the highest-rated show in five years.

Texto completo: TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained during President Donald Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.
White's mother, Joanne White, had told The New York Times that her 46-year-old son, who lives in Imperial Beach, Calif., went to Iran to see his girlfriend and had booked a July 27 flight back home to San Diego via the United Arab Emirates. She filed a missing person report with the State Department after he did not board the flight. She added that he had been undergoing treatment for a neck tumor and has asthma.
Comatose woman who had baby is hospitalized, police say
PHOENIX - An Arizona woman in a vegetative state who was sexually assaulted at a long-term care facility and had a baby is recovering at a hospital along with her child, authorities said Wednesday.
Commenting for the first time on the investigation since the Dec. 29 birth came to light, Phoenix police said finding a suspect is a top priority. Police are gathering DNA from all male employees at the facility.
Hacienda HealthCare owns the care facility and said it welcomed the DNA testing. Authorities served a search warrant Tuesday.
Local news website Azfamily.com first reported that the woman in a vegetative state for more than 10 years after a near-drowning had given birth to a boy.
It's unclear if staff members at the facility were aware of her pregnancy until the birth.
Republican senator signals interest in Trump's tax returns
WASHINGTON - Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said he's examining his authority to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, a move to ensure he could see any forms his Democratic counterpart in the House potentially receives.
Grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. Under a decades-old law, the heads of the tax-writing committees in Congress can request the tax returns of any taxpayer, including the president, from the Treasury Department.
Still, the Iowa Republican cautioned Wednesday that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask Treasury to release the documents. Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and wife divorcing after 25 years
SEATTLE - Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.
The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on his Twitter account.
Left unanswered was how the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.
Jeff Bezos' fortune hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that he owns.
Because they married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos holds a large claim to that fortune.
Jury sees El Chapo texts sent to wife while on run
NEW YORK - Text messages exchanged between notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and his wife while he was on the run in 2012 surfaced Wednesday at his U.S. trial, evidence the FBI says it uncovered with the help of a tech for the cartel who flipped on the kingpin.
The tech, Christian Rodriguez, also testified how Guzman was obsessed with spyware he had Rodriguez install on mobile phones he gave to members of his inner circle to keep an eye on them. The software churned out reports on phone activity that are being used against Guzman.
Also saved were text messages between Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, in which they touched on logistics for drug smuggling and shared encouragement as he fled a raid by authorities on a mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Baja.
Feds: Former commander at Gitmo slowed death probe
WASHINGTON - A former commander of the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he interfered with the investigation into the death of a civilian with whom he fought after an argument over whether the officer had an affair with the man's wife.
Navy Capt. John Nettleton remains on active duty, but he was removed from command shortly after civilian Christopher Tur was found floating in January 2015 in the waters off the base on the southeastern coast of Cuba.
Nettleton denied to his superior officer and others that he had the affair, but investigators later determined that it had happened, according to a federal indictment.
Nettleton was commander of the base since June 2012, but not the prison where suspected terrorists are held.
In LA: The union representing teachers in the nation's second-largest school district postponed a strike until Monday because of the possibility of a court-ordered delay. United Teachers Los Angeles had said its 35,000 members would walk off the job Thursday if a deal wasn't reached on pay raises and smaller classes.
Seeking asylum: A Saudi woman who fled her family to Thailand, alleging abuse, moved a step closer Wednesday to her goal of gaining asylum in Australia after a U.N. agency granted her refugee status.
Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun's father denied physically abusing her or trying to force her into an arranged marriage.

Texto completo: Are doctors responsible for obesity? What about dentists, are they responsible for cavities? And why aren't the police responsible for crime?
But you tell me, the teacher is responsible for learning. I say, baloney.
I am a teacher and a good one. My wife and I combined have nearly a half-century of teaching experience — small schools, big schools, inner-city schools and rural schools. So I know what I am talking about.
Teachers are a lot of things. We are all those nice words like caring, dedicated, passionate, resourceful, etc, etc. But we are also professionals, and I expect to be treated like one.
So here is my beef with you: Just because you went to school and sat through years of lessons, does not make you knowledgeable about what we do, just as eating at a restaurant does not make you an expert on cooking.
You point your finger at me and tell me to do my job and make your kid learn. Did you spend time with them before preschool reading or did you hand them your phone to shut them up.
Did you count numbers in your house and help them color what they saw in nature?
Once they finally got into preschool did you continue reading with them each night?
Jason McCutcheon, Douglas
An open letter to Arizona's new United States senators Senators Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema, I would like to ask you where you stand on border security and the government shutdown?
You have been in Washington for a week now and all we hear is crickets from your Senate offices on these issues.
If ever there was a time for reaching across the aisle to develop solutions it is now. After all, you do represent one of the four states that make up the southern border and have many citizens that are affected by the shutdown.
I would think you might have some concerns. It's time for you to work together, stand up and be heard, present the facts of the state of the southern border as you know them, and push the Senate to work to find a solution instead of sitting back and watching the world go by.
David Brooks has an op-ed in the New York Times on the current state of the government that both of you should read and absorb. In the case of Ms Sinema, you were elected to get things done. For Ms. McSally, Sen. McCain must be rolling over in his grave.
John LeMoine, Phoenix
It is wrong and unethical to back Donald Trump's corrupt behavior I do not support a wall. Even if we do get a wall the government will still need to fund surveillance, technology and officers to patrol the area. An investment in technology and resources would be more practical.
That being said, my family is suffering a great deal from this shutdown just as we have from shutdowns in the past. We are real people with real bills to pay. We have three children, a mortgage and two car payments.
We cannot afford to be without pay. The president is flat out wrong to continue this shutdown. This is abuse of power and abuse of his people. It is wrong and unethical to support his corrupt behavior.

Morning links: Analysis on Mitchell's sophomore season offered in The Ringer and by NBA scout

Texto completo: Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell has been the subject of a lot of debate in Jazzland this year. The sophomore guard from Louisville has become the Jazz's No. 1 offensive option, like he was last season, but has become the focal point of opposing teams' defenses, which have had a full offseason to scout Mitchell. This season, Mitchell is averaging 20.4 points per game, just down from his 20.5 points per game a season ago, albeit less efficiently than last year (40.9 percent shooting compared to 43.7 percent last year). As of late, Mitchell seems to have turned a corner, averaging 22.3 points per game over the last four games. Mitchell turned in one of his best halves of basketball in Detroit on Jan. 5, scoring 24 of his 26 points in the second half to lead the Jazz to victory, but against Milwaukee, he went 0-of-5 in the fourth quarter as the Jazz lost.
Mitchell's sophomore season is the subject of a new piece by Haley O'Shaughnessy in The Ringer.
"The Jazz are in the same position the Rockets were pre-Harden explosion — stuck without options, in desperate need of a bump in shooting, waiting for someone to save them. Harden has been that savior. He is Houston’s offense without Paul in the picture. And for nearly three quarters Monday, Mitchell was Utah’s. But the sophomore slumped in the final quarter and a half of play, hitting only one of his final 10 shots, turning the ball over twice in the final three minutes, and looking less like a Hardenesque first, second, and third option and more like, well, an exhausted 22-year-old," O'Shaughnessy writes.
An Eastern Conference Scout gives his take on Mitchell
In other "opinions about Donovan Mitchell" news, an NBA Eastern Conference scout offered his analysis on Mitchell in Marc Stein's New York Times NBA newsletter.
"The league really studies you and tries to develop a book on you. It's no different than baseball. He's not the new kid on the block any more, so teams are able to guard him a little better. He's in a good situation where they have complete trust in him. They've given him the keys to the city. And if he has a bad game, they're going to go to him the next time. The Jazz are lucky to have him, but he's lucky to be there, too," the scout writes.

Violet
Rhode Island, where Emily and Matthew Hyland met in college, has inspired their sixth and most elegant restaurant. For this latest venture, the two, who were instrumental in bringing square Detroit-style pizzas to Brooklyn, Manhattan and Nashville, are focusing on grilled pizzas in the style of Al Forno in Providence -- neither round nor square but "misshapen," as Mr. Hyland put it. They're topped with clams, hoisin sauce and duck prosciutto; grilled squash, Sichuan oil and chevre; and other combinations. There are also stuffies, the fist-size baked clams loved by Rhode Islanders, though Mr. Hyland said he would use more modest littlenecks instead of quahogs. The chef on hand is Alex Ureña, whose restaurant Ureña received two stars from Frank Bruni in The New York Times in 2006. Mr. Hyland will oversee the menu, which includes varying pasta dishes and plates. All come from an open kitchen in the back of the intimate space, which has a warmly lit arched ceiling and Art Deco touches. (Opens Thursday)

Opening
La Central
In planning the menu for the restaurant in the Hôtel Americano in Chelsea, the chef Franklin Becker started to look to Mexico. (The hotel's owners are from Mexico City.) But then, he said, he spoke with members of his staff, who came from Peru, Ecuador, El Salvador, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, in addition to Mexico, and invited them to explain the dishes they like to cook. Those conversations informed the menu. Acapulco-style ceviche, Peruvian leche de tigre shrimp, Colombian potato empanadas and Salvadoran mushroom pupusas are some of the dishes. Tacos, fish or steak for two, and arbol-spiced chicken are also on the menu. Mr. Becker has come up with savory churros crullers stuffed with cheese and garlic-jalapeño butter. The room is mostly gray, with marble tables and black leather seating. (Thursday)

Gitano Jungle Room
Last summer in SoHo, palms and other greenery decorated Gitano NYC, a pop-up version of a restaurant in Tulum, Mexico. It stayed open until October, despite a couple of interruptions by the city health department. Now James Gardner, who runs Grupo Gitano, has relocated it to the nearby James Hotel. The semi-underground room that was David Burke Kitchen is thick with trees and plants. Gitano's esteemed consulting chef, Mads Refslund of Sweden, and the executive chef and partner Yvan Lemoine are overseeing the creative Mexican menu.

Fiaschetteria Pistoia
A West Village branch of this Italian restaurant with roots in Pistoia, Italy, near Florence, has opened. For fans of its mostly Tuscan menu, it's in the nick of time: A fire on Christmas morning caused the East Village location to be closed temporarily. The new restaurant seats only 20, and does not take reservations.
114 Christopher Street (Bedford Street), 646-609-2911.
Valerie
Here's a serious drinking establishment on the edge of the theater district. The design recalls Art Deco on two levels, both offering food and drinks. The Gatsby Room and Gatsby Den feature local, small-batch spirits, and pay particular attention to gin and tonics, with more than a dozen gins and a choice of assorted artisanal tonics. The two spaces serve the chef Darren Pettigrew's crisp duck wings, meat and cheese boards, tuna tartare, flatbreads with assorted toppings, Korean-style fried chicken, steak frites and a turkey burger.

The Factory 380
The timing of this Andy Warhol homage by four partners who are big fans is spot on, considering the current exhibit of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The inspiration for the space -- a combination of two bars with room for 150 and a smaller speakeasy-style lounge named Edie's (for Edie Sedgwick, a muse) -- is the Factory, Warhol's Union Square studio. There are abundant references to the artist and to Studio 54, one of his hangouts.

Closed
Talde
Dale Talde's Asian restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn, closed on Jan. 1.
Blue Water Grill
After more than 20 years, this Union Square seafood staple is no more. The sign on the door says "This Location Has Permanently Closed." Blame a rent increase.
Chef on the Move
Christina Lecki
There have been changes at Reynard in the Wythe Hotel, starting with the departure last fall of Andrew Tarlow, a founder who ran the restaurant. Now Ms. Lecki, the executive chef, has left, with no further plans announced. Charlene Santiago is the chef in charge. In announcing Ms. Lecki's departure, the hotel's owner, Peter Lawrence, said, "We are now working hard on a reimagination of the food concept at the hotel that we will share in the coming months."
Expanding
The Institute of Culinary Education and the Natural Gourmet Institute
Long before the "wellness" trend, there was the Natural Gourmet Institute, founded in 1977 in New York by Annemarie Colbin. It offered classes in plant-based cooking and nutrition for amateurs and for chefs, more than 2,600 of whom completed the institute's six-month professional program. The school will close in April, and its curriculum will be taken over by the Institute of Culinary Education in Battery Park City, where its classes in vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and therapeutic food, thought to promote healing, will be available for recreational and professional cooks. "We have always thought it important and smart to offer a plant-and nutrition-oriented culinary training program, and the opportunity to have that based on N.G.I.'s highly-respected curriculum is fantastic," said Rick Smilow, the president on the Institute of Culinary Education.
Looking Ahead
Clean Slate Café
This pop-up serving free meals will be open from Jan. 23 to 25. It's presented by Whole30, a diet program, and Applegate Farms, a manufacturer of mostly organic processed meats, and will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Seating is limited and on a first-come, first-served basis. But registration for tickets that provide preferred entry will open on Wednesday through EventBrite (eventbrite.com).

Texto completo: Flannery O'Connor once expressed a wish that a novel could be published as quietly as a short story, "without having to hear from all the bright people in the Sunday papers."
Imagine her bemusement over "Cat Person." Published in late 2017 -- in the thick of #MeToo revelations -- the viral short story by Kristen Roupenian, then an M.F.A. student, became The New Yorker's second-most-read piece of the year, and a flash point in conversations about consent, its gray areas and how men metabolize rejection into rage.
Following the story's success, Roupenian received a seven-figure, two-book deal. Her first collection, "You Know You Want This," has just been published.
"Cat Person," included in the book, is a sour romance between Margot, a college student, and Robert, older, schlubby and insecure. It's a brisk, efficient piece of storytelling with a skillfully modulated sense of vertigo as Margot begins to realize she knows next to nothing about the man she is dating. By the time she is able to see past her projections, they're in his bedroom and he is undressing. It's like sending food back to the kitchen after you've ordered it, she reasons. A skin-crawling sex scene ensues. Margot later breaks off the relationship, and Robert handles it about as well as you might expect.
Many heralded the story, when it first appeared, not as a piece of fiction but as a dispatch from the murky zones of sex and dating. "'Cat Person' is basically a documentary" is a take I remember from the time. Others sniffed, saying relatability shouldn't be embraced as an artistic criterion. Some men felt personally attacked by the description of the male character, only to carry on a bit like him online -- not least a National Review columnist who wrote an angry and wounded open letter to Margot, chiding her for her behavior.
It was the usual internet life cycle, in other words. Everyone used the story to scold everyone else -- for liking it or not liking it enough or liking it for the wrong reasons. A few people made cat memes; everyone moved on.
The 11 other stories collected in "You Know You Want This" are far more extreme. They lead with caustic opening lines ("Ellie was a biter") and scenes of gaudy violence. The friendships are treacherous, the mothers more so. The sex might kill you. The man you're in love with might turn out to be an old thigh bone tied to a mirror (an actual plot point). Pedophilia, necrophilia, child abduction, child murder, mass murder -- go down the menu of fears and outré fantasies; they're all here.
And for what? This is a dull, needy book. The desire to seem shocking -- as opposed to a curiosity about thresholds physical and ethical -- tends to produce provocation of a very plaintive sort.
How do we spot the difference between those related but very different aims? Artists who ritually engage with cruelty see that engagement as a form of truthfulness -- a way to be frank; a way to honor the reader, not to bludgeon her. Here is Flannery O'Connor again, writing to a novelist friend about his work in progress: "Isn't it arbitrary to call these images such as the cat-faced baby and the old woman that looked like a cedar fence post and the grandfather who went around with Jesus hidden in his head like a stinger -- perverse? They are right, accurate, so why perverse?" Or turn to Mary Gaitskill, whose influence can be felt on every page of Roupenian's collection, and whose fiction is full of brutality but also deep sympathy for her characters: "I'm picturing a small core place in a person's heart that is hard to touch but that everyone wants touched," she has said about her work.
With Roupenian, there is just the giddiness of her imagination, of what she can get away with. In the first story, "Bad Boy," a couple becomes fixated on having a friend overhear them having sex. After a while, they invite him to watch, and later, participate. They order him into various acts of humiliation that culminate in a gamy little climax that would be horrifying if it weren't so sudden, so random and, finally, so meaningless. When the couple taunts him -- "Look at what you've done" -- I was shaken out of my numb disdain into a kind of anger. No, it's what the author has done, and why? I wanted better for these characters -- lives with real emotional stakes, actual personalities and not just kinks.
Ellie in "Biter" bites. Ted in "The Good Guy" needs to fantasize about stabbing women to sexually perform. Laura in "The Matchbox Sign" imagines that her body is crawling with parasites -- and her boyfriend participates in the fantasy. These characters remain their pathologies; the curtain falls on them before we can ever ask: Now what?
There's none of the simmer of "Cat Person" or its attention to language in the rest of these stories. Roupenian will work a metaphor until it screams. On a walk in the woods: "The vaginal lips of a pink lady's slipper peep out from behind some bushes; a rubber shred of burst balloon, studded by a plump red navel knot, dangles from a tree branch, and the corpse of a crushed mushroom gleams sad and cold and pale."
I might stay indoors for the rest of my life.
But there might be another chance for this book's raw material. The collection will be a series on HBO. "You Know You Want This" has a quarry's worth of raw suffering; maybe in the adaptation, we won't be just shocked, but shocked into something -- into a kind of understanding or feeling. That's what I know I want.

Weather app accused of selling personal data

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - People relied on the most popular mobile weather app to track forecasts that determined whether they chose jeans over shorts and packed a parka or umbrella, but its owners used it to track their every step and profit off that information, Los Angeles prosecutors said Friday.
The operator of The Weather Channel mobile app misled users who agreed to share their location information in exchange for personalized forecasts and alerts, and they instead unwittingly surrendered personal privacy when the company sold their data to third parties, City Attorney Michael Feuer said.
Feuer sued the app's operator in Los Angeles County Superior Court to stop the practice. He said 80 percent of users agreed to allow access to their locations because disclosures on how the app uses geolocation data were buried within a 10,000-word privacy policy and not revealed when they downloaded the app.
"Think how Orwellian it feels to live in a world where a private company is tracking potentially every place you go, every minute of every day," Feuer said. "If you want to sacrifice to that company that information, you sure ought to be doing it with clear advanced notice of what's at stake."
A spokesman for IBM Corp., which owns the app, said it has always been clear about the use of location data collected from users and will vigorously defend its "fully appropriate" disclosures.
Feuer said the app's operators, TWC Product and Technology LLC, sold data to at least a dozen websites for targeted ads and to hedge funds that used the information to analyze consumer behavior.
The lawsuit seeks to stop the company from the practice it calls "unfair and fraudulent" and seeks penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation. Any court decision would apply only to California.
Marketed as the "world's most downloaded weather app," The Weather Channel app claims approximately 45 million users a month, the lawsuit said.
Users who download the free app are asked whether to allow access to their location to "get personalized local weather data, alerts and forecasts." It does not say how the company benefits from the information.
While disclosures may be included in the privacy policy, state law says "fine print alone can't make good what otherwise has been made obscure," Feuer said.
He said he learned about the sale of the private data from an article in The New York Times.
The lawsuit comes as companies, most notably Facebook and Google, are increasingly under fire for how they use people's personal data. Both companies faced congressional hearings last year on privacy issues, which are likely to remain on the minds of lawmakers and regulators both nationally and in California.
In June, California lawmakers approved what experts are calling the country's most far-reaching law to give people more control over their personal data online. That law doesn't take effect until next year.
Feuer said he hopes the case inspires other lawsuits and legislation to curb data-sharing practices. - (AP)

Texto completo: Harrington takes 'daunting' role of Europe Ryder Cup captain
Padraig Harrington barely raised a smile as he spoke for the first time as Europe's new Ryder Cup captain.
In fact, as he discussed his thought process before accepting the position, the challenge awaiting him over the next 20 months and its potential impact on his golfing legacy, the role already seemed something of a burden for the easygoing Irishman.
"It's not something I take on without a certain amount of trepidation," Harrington, a three-time major champion, said.
He used the word "daunting." He acknowledged he was putting his golfing status on the line. He questioned whether he would find the "edge" needed to lift Europe to a win over what will be a strong American team at Whistling Straits in 2020.
Harrington did say he felt it was the right time to become captain. He played in six straight Ryder Cups from 1999 and was on the winning team four times, collecting 10 1/2 points. He has served as vice-captain for the past three Ryder Cups, most recently under Thomas Bjorn last year when Europe regained the trophy outside Paris.
He has learned from some of the great European captains and golfing figures -- Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley -- and said he will take little bits from each in a bid to maintain Europe's dominance in the event.
The Europeans have won nine of the last 12 Ryder Cups.NBA looking into circumstances of McCaw signing
A person with knowledge of the situation says the NBA is looking into the circumstances surrounding Cleveland's decision to sign Patrick McCaw to an offer sheet and then waive him after three games.
The league did so at the request of the Golden State Warriors, according to the person who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity because no details of the probe have been revealed publicly.
The New York Times first reported that the NBA would review the matter.
McCaw signed a two-year, $6 million offer sheet that was not guaranteed with the Cavaliers on Dec. 28. The Warriors, who held McCaw's rights as a restricted free agent, elected not to match those terms.
So McCaw was with the Cavs, until they waived him on Jan. 6 and made him an unrestricted free agent.Mercury fire assistant coach after domestic violence charge
PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Mercury have fired assistant coach Todd Troxel following an independent investigation into alleged domestic violence.
The team issued a statement Tuesday saying it had interviewed Troxel and his fiancee and concluded that his conduct during the incident was unacceptable.
Troxel was charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct following a physical altercation on Nov. 30 at the Phoenix-area home he shares with his fiancee.
TMZ reported Troxel had to be treated at a hospital after punching through glass during the encounter and his fiancee sustained a minor injury to her hand.
Troxel had been an assistant with the Mercury for five seasons under coach Sandy Brondello. He also worked with her with the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg.
It was not clear Tuesday whether Troxel had an attorney in the case.Falcons bring back Koetter, Mularkey as offensive assistants
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- The Atlanta Falcons brought back two familiar names on Tuesday by hiring Dirk Koetter as offensive coordinator and Mike Mularkey to coach tight ends.
Koetter and Mularkey are joining coach Dan Quinn's staff following stints as NFL head coaches.
Koetter returns to Atlanta following four seasons as Tampa Bay's coach. Mularkey most recently spent two seasons as the Tennessee Titans' coach, and also has been the head coach at Buffalo and Jacksonville.
Each has had previous success running the Atlanta offense with quarterback Matt Ryan. Mularkey was Ryan's first offensive coordinator in 2008-11. Koetter directed the Falcons' offense from 2012-14.
Quinn said he was "fired up" to have Koetter take over the offense.
"His experience and familiarity with our division will also pay dividends as we move forward," Quinn said in a statement.
Koetter replaces Steve Sarkasian, who was fired following the Falcons' 7-9 season. Quinn also fired defensive coordinator Marquand Manuel, special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong and tight ends coach Wade Harman. Quinn is taking over the defense.
Koetter was fired by Tampa Bay following a 5-11 finish this season, which ended with a 34-32 loss to the Falcons. He was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach in January 2016. He led the Bucs to a 9-7 record that year before back-to-back 5-11 finishes.
Koetter continued to guide the Buccaneers' offense as coach. Tampa Bay led the league with 294.4 yards passing per game during his three seasons.
The Falcons struggled with inconsistency on offense this season, Sarkasian's second with the team, as they failed to extend a streak of two straight playoff appearances. Injuries played a role as running back Devonta Freeman and both starting guards were placed on injured reserve.
The Falcons scored no more than 20 points in a stretch of five straight losses that ended their playoff hopes. They closed the season with an offensive resurgence in three straight wins, but it wasn't enough to save Sarkasian's job.
Before his time in Atlanta, Koetter was Jacksonville's offensive coordinator from 2007-11.
In Koetter's first three-year stint in Atlanta, the Falcons averaged 24.0 points to rank 10th in the league. They were fourth in the league in passing during that span.
Mularkey led the Titans to 9-7 finishes in both 2016 and 2017. He was fired following a divisional-round playoff loss to New England.
"Mike brings over 20 years of experience in our league as a former play-caller, head coach and as a player, and we are pleased to have him join our staff," Quinn said. "He has a good feel for our offense, both in the run game and the pass game, and we feel he will be able to add to the strengths of our tight ends group as we head into 2019."

Texto completo: This column doesn't wish to seem hard-hearted but feels obliged to ask the various parties negotiating an end to the partial government shutdown why the affected agencies have been employing nearly twice as many workers as they deem necessary to fulfill their missions. Whether President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer decide to call structures at the border walls or fences, they ought to at least explain how they are managing the public payroll inside the United States.
Various media reports have noted that the temporary closure of 25% of the government has forced roughly 420,000 federal workers deemed essential to continue working while some 380,000 who are not deemed essential stay home. If it were a business, this non-essential portion of just a quarter of our government would be among the largest private employers in the country. Does this mean that non-essentials approach 1.5 million across the entire government? As American businesses scour their communities for talent during an historic worker shortage, taxpayers seem to be paying to maintain the world's largest reserve force of bureaucrats.
An incurious press corps seems largely uninterested in the appropriate size of the federal workforce. Numerous recent reports have covered the shutdown story largely as a tale of a villainous President inflicting uncertainty on civil servants who wonder when they will be able to pay their mortgages.
"As thousands of furloughed federal employees worry about when their next paycheck will arrive, their bills are piling up," writes Renata Birkenbuel in a recent Newsweek story.
"Government Shutdown Leaves Workers Reeling," reads a New York Times headline from January 3.
Government Executive magazine reported the next day on legislative efforts to ensure that federal shutdowns never again threaten federal paychecks:
Maryland's Senate delegation on Thursday reintroduced a bill to ensure that federal workers furloughed during the partial government shutdown, and any potential future shutdowns, will be promptly given back pay once federal agencies reopen.
Paid furloughs are nice. Depending on the individual employee, getting tagged non-essential can be either insulting and discouraging or a cause to celebrate an unexpected stay-cation. Still, there's no upside for people who have to wait for paychecks. Such delays can create problems with creditors--though perhaps not as many as one would think. "Servicers treating government shutdown like a natural disaster," reads the headline on a Friday report from American Banker. The trade publication notes:
As the government shutdown enters its third week, mortgage servicers are activating the response plans they normally use during hurricanes and wildfires to assist federal workers who may have trouble paying their mortgages.
...During the shutdown in 2013, the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac all called for temporary postponement on mortgage payments for furloughed workers. Lenders are offering paycheck loan assistance programs this time around.
Credit unions like Navy Federal and PenFed, are providing 0% APR loans for impacted members who have established direct deposit accounts with them.
...Mortgage servicers offer forbearance to bridge the gap.
This column doesn't wish for anyone to miss an earned paycheck. But the people who support the federal payroll deserve an explanation for why their political leaders seem to be buying almost twice as much bureaucracy as even official Washington deems necessary.

7 ways the federal shutdown is affecting Connecticut

Texto completo: The partial federal government shutdown is now in its third week, and threatens to become the longest ever in United States history.
It’s having a tangible effect in Connecticut in a variety of ways, some of them unexpected.
Here are 7 ways the federal shutdown may very soon or is already affecting Connecticut.

CT would feel aftershocks of federal government shutdown
1. Courts could stop prosecuting
The federal public defender’s office has 23 employees in Connecticut, all of whom will work without pay or refuse to work at all on Friday, should the shutdown not be resolved, the Hartford Courant reported.
But with no money flowing from Justice Department, Connecticut’s federal courts could stop prosecuting civil cases altogether and, should the shutdown continue for “months or even years,” as President Donald Trump suggested it might, criminal cases would halt as well.
The agencies whose workers are not currently being paid include the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard and Secret Service.
2. Tax refunds in question
All Internal Revenue Service operations have stopped, according to an internal memo posted on the IRS website. “An IRS-wide furlough began on December 22, 2018, for everyone except already-identified excepted employees.”
That would mean any scheduled refunds will not be issued, though your taxes will still be due on tax day.
However, on Monday, a Trump administration official taxpayers who are owed money will be paid on time. Russell Vought, acting director of the White House budget office, said customary rules will be changed to make the payments possible.
3. Passports may not get issued or renewed
The Social Security Administration will be sending out social security checks this year, but with most agency functions shuttered for the duration of the shutdown, that means no new or replacement Social Security cards.
That affects the State Department, too, meaning new and renewed passports may be in jeopardy.
“Consular operations, including visa and passport services, domestically and abroad will remain open as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations,” the U.S. State Department said in statement to Hearst. “If a domestic passport agency is located in a U.S. government building affected by a lapse in appropriations, the facility may become unsupported and therefore unavailable to the public.
4. Many national parks are closed
There are five national parks in Connecticut, some of which will remain open but have limited services for the duration.
An alert on the National Parks website reads, “Some national parks may remain accessible to visitors; however, access may change without notice. Some parks are closed completely. Some visitor services may be available when provided by concessioners or other entities.”
5. Air traffic control is affected
Air traffic controllers at Bradley International Airport are working without pay, and face losing their jobs completely if they choose to stay home, the Courant reported.
There are about 15,000 air traffic controllers in the United States — some in Connecticut — who are marked “essential.”
That means they’re working, but not getting paid.
6. Airports are less secure
Unpaid TSA workers across the country are calling in sick, many calling it a “blue flu,” according to NBC.
As of Friday, 150 TSA workers at Kennedy International Airport called out sick, The New York Times reported.
7. You can’t buy a home
The problem isn’t the loan itself — FHA loans, or any made through the VA, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are moving forward. The problem is the IRS can’t verify your income or provide key tax return documentation, according to the Connecticut Mirror.
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, won’t write the flood insurance policies needed to buy a home along the shoreline.

World News: Visit to Turkey Is Test for Bolton --- U.S. official angered Ankara by saying Syria pullout requires safety guarantee for Kurds

Texto completo: ANKARA, Turkey -- President Trump's national security adviser is likely to face an icy reception in Ankara on Tuesday over his remarks that a U.S. withdrawal from Syria is contingent on whether Turkey can guarantee the safety of the Kurdish forces across its border.
The comments by John Bolton, calling on the Turks to commit to the safety and security of U.S.-allied Kurdish rebel groups in Syria, angered the government in Ankara, which has insisted for years that Syria's Kurdish rebel groups are terrorists and pose an existential threat.
On Monday, pro-government daily newspaper Yeni Safak carried a front-page photo of Mr. Bolton with a banner headline saying: "Who are you?"
Mr. Bolton, who arrived in the Turkish capital on Monday, is scheduled to meet with top Turkish officials in the hope of laying the groundwork for America's exit from Syria.
Less than a month ago, Turkish officials thought they had struck a deal with the U.S. on Syria, which thrust Turkey into the role of Washington's indispensable partner in the Middle East -- a dramatic change of fortune after months of turbulent relations.
During a Dec. 14 phone call with President Trump, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had pledged to relieve the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State extremist group in Syria. Days later, Mr. Trump, citing Turkey's commitment, publicly announced his intention to quickly withdraw from Syria. He had promised such a withdrawal while campaigning for president, but doing so has proved difficult amid fears of a power vacuum in Syria.
Turkish officials applauded the U.S. decision to leave Syria and end its partnership with the Kurdish YPG militia, and Mr. Trump had made no mention of a requirement that Turkey protect those fighters. Only on Sunday, when Mr. Bolton spoke with journalists traveling with him to Israel and Turkey, did the condition come to light.
Now, the entire agreement could be at risk, Turkish officials and analysts said.
"There is no need to explain that a terror organization cannot be a U.S. ally," Ibrahim Kalin, an Erdogan spokesman and Mr. Bolton's counterpart in the Syrian discussions, said Sunday.
Mr. Bolton and his team of negotiators, which includes State Department envoy James Jeffrey and Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled to Turkey in hope of carving out a plan for that nation to take over the fight, as well as to discuss possible measures to ensure Ankara sticks to its pledges.
A senior administration official said the U.S. is, for example, considering maintaining control of the airspace in northern Syria to ensure that allied forces in the region aren't subjected to air attacks.
Kurdish fighters long have provided the U.S. with solid support in the campaign against Islamic State. But Turkey considers itself justified in targeting those fighters and doesn't draw distinctions between those groups and militant groups like Islamic State.
In December, Mr. Erdogan said he would launch a military intervention in northeastern Syria to combat Kurdish rebels it regards as terrorists, drawing a stern warning from the Pentagon.
"We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum," Mr. Bolton said on Sunday.
In a New York Times opinion piece on Monday, Mr. Erdogan said he intends to use a "complete vetting process" after any U.S. withdrawal from Syria to make sure fighters have "no links to terrorist organizations."
Turkey's unhappiness over the evolving U.S. position on the Syrian troop pullout came after the two capitals appeared to be renewing ties. Turkey released American pastor Andrew Brunson in October, after his two years in detention on terror charges clouded the relationship.
At the same time, Turkey was embroiled in a spat with Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who had been critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
Although Mr. Trump has dismissed a Central Intelligence Agency assessment that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, Mr. Erdogan has seized on the widespread uproar over Mr. Khashoggi's death to rebuild his standing in Washington.
Saudi officials say Prince Mohammed played no role in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.

Secret Alabama campaign used tactics of Russians

Texto completo: A secret effort to influence the 2017 Senate election in Alabama used tactics inspired by Russian disinformation teams, including the creation of fake accounts to deliver misleading messages on Facebook to hundreds of thousands of voters to help elect Democrat Doug Jones, according to a document obtained by The Washington Post.
But unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when Russians worked to help elect Donald Trump, the people behind the Alabama effort — dubbed Project Birmingham — were Americans. Now Democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in Project Birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.
Jones’ narrow upset over Republican Roy Moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, analysts say. Moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.
Recent revelations about Project Birmingham, however, have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign.
As the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and Facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the Project Birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. Those included a "false flag" effort that generated phony evidence that automated Russian accounts called bots had supported Moore on Twitter and the creation of a misleading Facebook page, aimed at Alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine Moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival Republican through a write-in campaign.
But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.
Project Birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in The New York Times and The Post.
Hoffman gave $750,000 to progressive technology startup American Engagement Technologies — founded by Mikey Dickerson, a former Obama administration official — which aimed to help Democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person said Dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire New Knowledge, a Texas-based social media research firm, to work in Alabama in support of Jones during the special election.
Dickerson — who is best known for leading the effort to fix HealthCare.gov, the glitchy portal for President Barack Obama’s signature health care initiative — said in a statement to The Post that he learned of the extent of Project Birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.
"I received the report in early 2018, which is when I first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics," Dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.
That report, he said, came from New Knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. More recently, it co-authored a report last month on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the Project Birmingham document and disputed Dickerson’s claim that New Knowledge wrote it.
What is known about Project Birmingham comes mainly from the 12-page memo labeled "Project Birmingham Debrief," which was obtained by The Post. It is dated Dec. 15, 2017, three days after the Alabama vote.
The document describes the effort as "a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the AL senate race" by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing Jones. Jones has said he had no knowledge of Project Birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.
The goal of the effort was to "radicalize Democrats, suppress unpersuadable Republicans (‘hard Rs’) and faction moderate Republicans by advocating for write-in candidates," the document states.
The document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving "enough votes to ensure a Doug Jones victory."
Political analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.
"My initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign I’ve read about would not have been enough to affect this race. Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started," said University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith.
The Post found evidence for several of the document’s claims.
For example, the document says it "planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet. We then tied that botnet to the Moore campaign digital director, making it appear as if he had purchased the accounts." Morgan denied any knowledge of the incident involving Russian bots.
During the campaign, journalists wrote stories about Twitter accounts that appeared to be Russian followers of Moore.
Those accounts were later suspended by Twitter. The Post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the Alabama election describing evidence that Russian bots were supporting Moore. The Project Birmingham document cited an article in the New York Post with the headline "Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers."
Other journalists, however, expressed skepticism at the time, noting that the supposed Russian bots made obvious mistakes, leaving profile information in some tweets in Cyrillic, the Russian-language alphabet.
Evidence also supports the document’s claims about creating a conservative Facebook page to siphon support from Moore. In a section headed "Splitting Republican votes," the document says a Facebook page created by Project Birmingham had contact with a Republican write-in candidate beginning on Nov. 18, 2017, and later endorsed this candidate, who was not named.
The description and timing fits the experience of Mac Watson, the owner of a patio supply store who ran a Republican write-in campaign and said he had communications with a Facebook page beginning on that date.
The document also describes Project Birmingham helping the unnamed write-in candidate gain new Twitter followers — something Watson recalls as well, with 10,000 suddenly appearing on his account. He also gained some exposure with the help of the operator of the Facebook page, which the document claims acted as a "media advisor" helping to arrange interviews with news organizations, including The Post.
Watson said that, in retrospect, the goals of the mysterious entity behind the Facebook page are now clear: "It was about the shifting of votes, to be honest with you," he said.

Texto completo: A former kitchen employee at one of President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.
Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident.
But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.
Torres' account, first reported by The New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.
Trump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.
The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his rhetoric against illegal immigration.
Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In fall 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it."
Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years.
Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.
Torres' experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.
Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club, cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.
"I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday. Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.
Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control."
She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.
Official pins indicating that someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.
It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.
Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.
The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.
Morales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."
"They knew I didn't have good papers," said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.
Trump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers.
Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."
A person close to the organization said an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.
Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015, doing housekeeping, then she moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.
Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.
Trump visited Bedminster at least six times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.
Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited.
At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.
Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen.
She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.

Southern bites, beer bound for Concord

Texto completo: Something's cooking at the former site of the Korner Kupboard.

Well, not yet; if you popped by, you'd find that the former market on Route 3 near the state prison is a bit of a mess right now. But Alan Natkiel – Granite State native and New York City Southern barbecue legend – has big plans for this little space.
See, back in the Big Apple, Natkiel used to run this spot called Georgia's Eastside BBQ. The name serves as both a reference to where he learned his love of Southern cooking (he went to school at Emory University in Atlanta), as well as homage to Georgia, the “coolest, most relaxed and protective” Sicilian mastiff Natkiel ever knew.
The place was a hit and attracted the attention of big-name publications, like New York Magazine, CBS News, and as of this year, The New York Times. Chef Rachael Ray, Good Morning America and Fox News also took an interest.
But constant construction next door on a new luxury condo development caused too much chaos, and Eastside closed in May.
If you're not an NYC foodie, the name Natkiel may still ring a bell. He dropped into Concord last New Year's with a pop-up restaurant in the Little Creperie to host a dinner, featuring a cashew jalapeno rice bowl.
Now, Natkiel is looking to start again in the Capital City – a new joint, named Georgia's Northside, serving up Southern bites and craft beer at 394 N State St.
This won't be your slowed-down, sit-down type of place, however. Natkiel's vision is for a take-out joint, focusing on special sides along with your traditional barbecue foods and catering to the plentiful Route 3 traffic.
It's the accouterments that really bring a Southern meal home, Natkiel says. It's just one of the ways his mother (“The best cook I know,” he'll tell you) influenced his love of food, growing up on a horse farm in the town of Hill.
“My mom eats all different types of meat, but not a lot of it,” he said. “We were heavily garden influenced.”
As of right now, Natkiel's planning to open in April. As construction continues, he's thinking about how to overcome one of his biggest challenges – finding local, talented cooks who want to put some soul into their food.
“You can't just pay somebody to care,” he said. “I'd rather have someone who never worked in a professional kitchen, but says, ‘I'm an avid home cook, you should see my Instagram, I'm posting food pics all the time.'
“I'd be like, ‘Okay, well I can teach you,' ” he continued. “But if the next person is just looking for a paycheck and to leave at quitting time, then to hell with them.”
Natkiel foresees barbecue staples like ribs and smoked brisket on the menus, along with traditional sides like red skin potato salad, sweet braised greens and homemade coleslaw. In addition, he's thinking homemade breakfast sandwiches, a variety of healthy salads and some healthy dinner specials to round it out.
Initially, Northside will only offer to-go and catering services, but Natkiel said delivery is also in the future.
If you're curious to see what kind of food Natkiel will be serving, check out Georgia's Northside on Facebook and Instagram.
Sidewalk stipulations
There will be new rules for the city's downtown sidewalks in the New Year.
The Concord City Council approved new regulations for its sidewalks in August. The regulations, part of the city's efforts to create a Main Street Design Guide, are meant to make the reconfigured downtown's sidewalks accessible and usable for pedestrians and businesses alike.
This includes formalizing the rules for outdoor dining, sidewalk signage and other amenities an owner might find useful.
Some of the rules are as follows:
Businesses must remove all encumbrances from the sidewalk when it isn't operating and clean up the sidewalk or other public property areas at the end of each day.
Tables, chairs, signs or other items can't block doors or egresses, adjoining properties, or fire-related equipment.
The sidewalk has been divided into zones: Zone A is 6 to 8 feet wide and is closest to the building and is where tables and chairs are allowed. Zone B is the main travel lane, must be at least 6 feet wide and remain unobstructed. Zone C allows for planters and the city's brick pavers.
Table awnings or umbrellas can't project further into the sidewalk than the tables.
Kiosks, benches, bike racks, waste receptacles, wayfinding signage and any other public amenities provided by the city need at least three feet of space and can't be obstructed.
A sidewalk sign can't be bigger than four feet high and three feet wide and can be placed in the city's right-of-way. They can be made of metal and wood. Nonconforming signs may be removed by city staff and will be stored on city property for up to 10 days or until the sign owner complies with the rules. After 10 days, the signs will be destroyed.
Using the sidewalk will require a “Business Use of Public Property” permit. Those permits allow for usage from April 1 to Nov. 15 of the same year. Sidewalk signs are allowed year-round.

Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Ex-Publisher of Artforum Magazine

Texto completo: A judge in New York City has dismissed a lawsuit that alleged that Knight Landesman, the former publisher of Artforum magazine, sexually harassed a former employee and at least eight other women.
The lawsuit, filed in October 2017, included accusations that Mr. Landesman -- a power broker in the art world -- had groped, attempted to kiss and sent vulgar messages to the women, and, on occasion, retaliated against them when they spurned his advances. Mr. Landesman resigned hours after the lawsuit was filed.
The former employee, Amanda Schmitt -- the plaintiff in the case -- did not sue for workplace sexual misconduct because the statute of limitations had run out; instead, she brought a retaliation claim against Mr. Landesman that alleged he had cornered her at a restaurant in May 2017 and assailed her in front of others for having accused him of harassment.
But in his order filed last month, the judge, Justice Frank P. Nervo of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, wrote that five years had passed between the time Ms. Schmitt had worked for Artforum and when the restaurant episode took place -- enough time "to eliminate any nexus between her employment and the alleged acts." He found that Mr. Landesman had spoken in a "purely social setting," that he was entitled to defend himself and that his statements were not defamatory.
Therefore, Justice Nervo reasoned, Ms. Schmitt had failed to "state a cause of action," and "there was no unlawful, retaliatory act." He also dismissed a related claim of slander against Mr. Landesman and Artforum, as well as ones claiming gross negligence and defamation. The ruling was reported by ARTnews on Thursday afternoon.
Ms. Schmitt's lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, said her team was considering an appeal.
"Our view is that Amanda has already won her case," she said. "This is a purely legal decision. It takes nothing away from the facts alleged and shown in our complaint: Knight Landesman was a serial predatory harasser harbored by Artforum."
A lawyer for Mr. Landesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening. Attempts to reach Mr. Landesman were not successful.
In a statement, Artforum's three publishers said: "While the claims against Artforum have been dismissed, we remain firm in our commitment to maintain a safe and equitable workplace for our employees and associates."
For decades, Mr. Landesman, 68, had been a pillar of the international art scene, a man-about-town known from the galleries of Manhattan to the Art Basel fair in Switzerland for his primary-colored suits and deep connections in the industry. The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell, until his resignation. It came just weeks after The New York Times and The New Yorker published articles describing decades of sexual predations by the film producer Harvey Weinstein, a catalyst for the #MeToo movement.
Ms. Schmitt, a New York curator, started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21. Shortly after she took the job, the lawsuit contended, Mr. Landesman "singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention," subjecting her to questions about her sex life while "touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck."
Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email in which he praised "brown nosing" as a sales technique before veering off into a different -- and sexually explicit -- description of the practice, according to the suit. Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, it stated.
Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending sexually explicit notes, she contended.
In June 2016, Ms. Schmitt sent Mr. Landesman a text message saying: "You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so. I want it to stop." Mr. Landesman wrote back promising "professionalism in the future," according to the suit. Ms. Schmitt also met with two of Artforum's other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent. And on June 15, 2016, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising "he was taking action to ensure that whatever may have transpired never happens again."
According to the suit, however, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events. In her lawsuit, Ms. Schmitt brought a claim against the magazine for having breeched its promise, but Justice Nervo dismissed the claim.
Then in May 2017, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic. Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had "unfairly accused" him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended. Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and "listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment."
Ms. Reisbaum noted that Mr. Landesman had continued to work at Artforum for months "after we made our allegations privately."
"It was only after we made our allegations public that Landesman resigned," she said, "and still, Artforum denied the gravity of the situation."

Denialism clouds outlook for battling climate change

Resumen: In November, a U.S. government panel reported that by the end of the century, rising global temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy — affecting farms, coastlines, the fishing industry and people’s health. Some outlets can do better — namely cable news, which still slots too many climate change stories behind news of the latest presidential tweet or special counsel development. [...]she turned up the volume: “But for those who would continue to parrot the president’s dim-witted, Fox-friendly sound bite that global warming is a ‘hoax,’ or intentionally confuse weather and climate while pointing to a mound of snow in your backyard, you’re now officially part of the problem.”

Texto completo: Dictionary.com recently named “misinformation” the word of the year for 2018. Not a bad choice, to be sure. But the language gurus should have given some serious consideration to another word as well: denialism.
Even if it’s not the word of the year, denialism is certainly a word for our times. It lies at the center of the debate over climate change, an issue that’s finally climbing to the top of our national consciousness.
Incredibly, a significant number of people, including our president, simply deny that climate change is a problem. And this is despite stark warnings from scientists, who, we definitely should assume, know what the heck they’re talking about.
And make no mistake, the warnings are grim. In October, a United Nations panel reported that by 2040, atmospheric warming caused by emissions will spell more wildfires, coastal flooding, droughts, food shortages and poverty. In November, a U.S. government panel reported that by the end of the century, rising global temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy — affecting farms, coastlines, the fishing industry and people’s health.
It’s all a hoax?
Let’s face reality. We only get one planet.
Denial, according to the Mayo Clinic, is “a coping mechanism that gives you time to adjust to distressing situations — but staying in denial can interfere with treatment or your ability to tackle challenges.”
When it comes to climate change, we have to tackle this challenge.
This denialism dates back to the late 1980s, when then-Sen. Al Gore called a series of hearings on the warming problem. The fossil fuel industry countered with a coordinated effort to sow doubt. It included think tanks, lobbying blitzes, ads and op-eds, and even went so far as to offer scientists cash to pen articles questioning the new science, according to a 2007 Newsweek article titled “The Truth About Denial.”
If there’s any good news to be gleaned today, it’s that climate change is getting more centerpiece treatment in the news. Stories are routinely the lead on sites for major news outlets such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, and they get significant airtime on television news.
Some outlets can do better — namely cable news, which still slots too many climate change stories behind news of the latest presidential tweet or special counsel development. And then there’s Fox News. Let’s hope it has learned a little something and doesn’t respond to the first blizzard of 2019 with a story questioning the very existence of climate change, as it has done before.
But has Fox News learned anything? Specifically, the difference between long-term climate patterns and today’s weather? Maybe not, because much of its fan base is still in denial.
President Donald Trump, leader of the fan base, has emerged as the world’s leading denier. He said point-blank that he doesn’t believe the November report from his own government, and the businessman-turned-television-star-turned-politician has issued some bizarro statements about his “natural instinct” for science. After all, his uncle was a science professor.
Same goes for Pennsylvania’s former senator, Rick Santorum, now a CNN talking head. He floated the notion on air that scientists inflate the problem to keep research funding flowing and hold onto their jobs. Is it any wonder Santorum lost that U.S. Senate seat?
Not only should climate change be a top news story, one that viewers pay close attention to, but it should be one of the first things we see when we click on the policy section of every politician’s website. It should be a leading question in polls and presidential debates. It should worry us as much as — if not more than — terrorism, illegal immigration, Russian interference and North Korea’s nuclear program.
“It’s time to sound the planetary alarm,” wrote Max Boot, a former climate change skeptic, in The Washington Post last month.
For sure, the alarm needs to be turned up louder on the right.
Writing in the New York Daily News recently, conservative pundit S.E. Cupp sought to talk some sense into her right-leaning readers. It is “willfully ignorant and negligent,” she wrote, to ignore the scientific warnings that the planet is warming due largely to human activity.
And then she turned up the volume: “But for those who would continue to parrot the president’s dim-witted, Fox-friendly sound bite that global warming is a ‘hoax,’ or intentionally confuse weather and climate while pointing to a mound of snow in your backyard, you’re now officially part of the problem.”
And don’t be surprised if your affliction is the next word of the year.

Texto completo: As the new year turns and Democrats focus on candidates to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020, there’s one number they should keep in mind: 47. Here’s why. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have elected only four presidents who did not hold the office already: John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Those four successful Democrats share many traits, but one of the most striking is their age on the day they were elected. They range from Kennedy, 43, to Carter, 52, but their average was — yes — 47. In fact, that was Obama’s exact age when he defeated 72-year-old John McCain. Of course, age is a very rough metric, but looking at the emerging field of Democratic aspirants, one impression is unmistakable. The potential candidate who best fits the profile of Democratic winners is Beto O’Rourke, the three-time congressman from El Paso, Texas, who narrowly lost a Senate race in November. On Election Day 2020, he will be 48.
A closer look at the four victorious post-war Democrats shows that their age was really a symbol for a much larger issue. Their youth helped shape their narratives, the stories they told voters about their past experiences and their plans for the future. Kennedy spearheaded the wave of returning World War II veterans who entered politics and assumed the leadership of the country. Carter was not a harbinger of a new generation, but as a naval officer-turned-peanut farmer, and then as a governor who had never served in the capitol, he represented a clean break from the "swamp" of post-Watergate Washington. Clinton was the first baby boomer president who talked about "building a bridge to the 21st century" and played on the name of his hometown in Arkansas when he told the Democratic convention in 1992, "I still believe in a place called Hope." Thirteen years before he was elected president, Barack Obama published a best-selling memoir, "Dreams From My Father," which told a new version of an old American story: a biracial child overcoming adversity and achieving success through his own merit and motivation.
Obama has met with O’Rourke since the election, and in an interview with his close adviser David Axelrod, the former president praised the defeated congressman as an "impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas."
Obama even drew parallels between himself and O’Rourke. He won in 2008, Obama told Axelrod, because "people had a sense that I said what I meant," and he discerned the same attempt to level with voters in the Texan’s failed campaign: "What I liked most about his race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested."
Two New York Times political writers see another parallel between the two men. "Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign," wrote Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin, "Mr. O’Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground."
This is all very premature. O’Rourke might not even run for president. But if he does, remember the magic number is 47.

Torture, Ostracism and Then Censorship

Texto completo: "La Religieuse" ("The Nun"), the second feature by the New Wave director Jacques Rivette, ignited a first-class scandal -- a preview of a French upheaval to come.
Long without an American distributor, the movie opens on Friday for two weeks at Film Forum in a new 4K DCP restoration. As the New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby wrote on the occasion of its 1971 commercial release, "It's with pleasure that I report its arrival."
The story of a teenage girl forced by her parents into a nightmarish convent, "La Religieuse" is based on Denis Diderot's 18th-century epistolary novel. The New Wave exemplar Anna Karina stars as the unwilling novice Suzanne Simonin who, brutalized and sexually harassed, is driven to find her freedom in death.
Although based on a literary classic, "La Religieuse" was attacked by influential Catholics and cultural conservatives even before it was completed in 1965. Twice approved for release by the Censorship Board, it was twice blocked by the Minister of Information. Mention of the ban was itself banned on French TV.
Elliott Stein, an American journalist living in Paris, reported in the British film magazine Sight and Sound that "Le Monde ran a day-to-day feature, 'L'Affaire de La Religieuse,' to which one opened as if to a daily horoscope or weather report." His article gave examples of the heated discourse Rivette's movie inspired. A writer for the right-wing weekly Carrefour declared: "If, in the name of freedom, we let this film be shown, we might just as well throw open the doors of France to all the dirty hairy beatniks of the earth."
Beatniks prevailed when, after a year of acrimony, the Minister of Culture André Malraux allowed "La Religieuse" to be shown at Cannes. It was met with acclaim mixed with befuddlement. The New York Times correspondent, Bosley Crowther, found the film's prohibition a "riddle." Still, it was as a free-speech martyr that "La Religieuse" made its American debut at the 1968 New York Film Festival.
The festival that year included two masterpieces by Jean-Luc Godard ("Weekend" and "Two or Three Things I Know About Her"), Robert Bresson's "Mouchette" and John Cassavetes's "Faces," along with first features by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet; Werner Herzog; and new movies from Bernardo Bertolucci, Milos Forman, Miklos Jancso, Norman Mailer and Orson Welles. Even in this crowd, "La Religieuse" stood out, less for its notoriety than its brilliant filmmaking and impassioned restraint.
"La Religieuse" is founded on contradictions. The movie is as sumptuous in its color photography as it is austere in its mise-en-scène. Suzanne is victimized equally by repression and license. Her situation simultaneously evokes pre-Revolutionary France and 20th-century Europe. Rivette's direction is both theatrical and cinematic. Unable to get funding for a film, he first presented "La Religieuse" as a stage play, partially underwritten by Godard as a vehicle for Karina, who was then his wife.
Anticipating many of Rivette's later films, "La Religieuse" has a ritualistic quality accentuated by a sound design of tolling bells and clapped wooden blocks. The movie consists largely of interiors; that many were shot in a sixth-century abbey gives it a documentary feel. So too, the long takes and continuous observation of Suzanne's ordeal. (Some have seen the film as a forerunner of Lars von Trier's "Dogville.")
Karina, whose expressive suffering is worthy of a D.W. Griffith actress, appears in all but a few scenes and nearly every shot. At her first convent, Suzanne is subject to torture, interrogation and ostracism. ("Walk on her, she's just a corpse," the mother superior instructs her sisters.) She is accused of heresy, put on trial, and thwarted by the clerical bureaucracy. Brought to a second convent run by a flighty libertine abbess (Liselotte Pulver, who played a bombshell secretary in Billy Wilder's 1961 comedy "One, Two, Three"), Suzanne experiences another sort of torment.
Throughout, her desire for freedom is taken for madness. (In early 19th-century France, political dissidents and atheists were often committed to mental hospitals.) "La Religieuse" is not so much anticlerical as it is anti-authoritarian. The movie's real subject is the nature of social control, the totalitarian demand for unquestioning obedience and the capricious application of power -- a theme that may have inspired and was only reinforced by its arbitrary censorship.

Immigrant cuisines and fare play

Texto completo: Nearly six years ago, when the editors and I launched this experiment in budget dining, I came up with a shortlist of potential column names. They were all centered on the concept of cheap eating. Back then, I didn't fully appreciate what kind of prison I was creating for myself and, more important, for the restaurants and chefs in my same orbit.
Which is why, as of today, this column will no longer be known as the $20 Diner. Let me attempt to explain the reasons.
To my mind, focusing on a low price point perpetuates some problems. Among them:
It creates artificial limits. Over the past 12 months, I have written about restaurants that specialize in Egyptian, Nepalese, Yemeni, Ethiopian, Indian, Thai, Jamaican, Korean, Persian, Philippine, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian, Cuban, Italian, Japanese and American cuisines. Notice anything conspicuously missing from that list?
I did not devote a single column last year to a French restaurant.
Why? Is it because French restaurants, even their informal bistro cousins, tend to have a higher price point than the $20 ceiling that I placed on entrees? Or is it because I, as a writer and critic, do not view French cuisine as affordable, no matter how casual the establishment? Whatever the reason, French cooking has cachet in the public imagination, and that translates into how much folks are willing to pay for it, which is, I suspect, more than many are willing to shell out for Mexican or Chinese food.
By writing about immigrant cuisines under a cheap-eats rubric, I have perpetuated the narrative that they should always be thought of as budget-priced. I'm reminded of a conversation I had with David Chang when he was preparing to open Momofuku CCDC in 2015. Chang was firing on all cylinders that day: He was unspooling long, profanity-laced sentences about diners who won't pay $17 or $18 for a bowl of ramen, no matter how costly the ingredients he used for his noodle soup.
"It is not cheap at all" to prepare the ramen, he told me. "Here's one thing: If we opened an Italian restaurant, and I said that it's something in brodo with brisket, I could charge you [expletive] $27 and no one would ever [expletive] blink. That pisses me off, that I'm stuck by some type of ethnic price ceiling."
It helps confirm deep-seated biases . Krishnendu Ray, a New York University associate professor of food studies, has written a lot about our perceptions of a cuisine based on the immigrant group's place in American society. The lower the immigrants are on the social ladder, Ray argues, the less we value their cooking. This explains the roller-coaster ride that Italian food has endured in America, Ray writes in "The Ethnic Restaurateur," noting that the perceived value of the country's cooking took a nose-dive in the late 1800s when poor immigrants from southern Italy flocked to the United States.
But, Ray adds, this also explains "the difficulty of Chinese, Mexican and soul food to break away, in dominant American eyes, from the contamination effect of low-class association. Poor, mobile people are rarely accorded the cultural capital."
Given this theory, I've had to ask myself uncomfortable questions, such as: Isn't lumping certain cuisines under a cheap-eats banner only contributing to their low-class status? Am I not kneecapping, say, Central American cooks who toil in almost every kitchen in the District? Am I not telling these cooks that we, as Washingtonians, will never pay the same price for a Salvadoran, Guatemalan or Puerto Rican meal as we do for that plate of charred brassicas with mint chimichurri at the fancy New American restaurant where these immigrants are currently employed?
It implies some restaurants are not destinations or otherwise special. I still vividly remember reading "Garlic and Sapphires," Ruth Reichl's entertaining, if journalistically compromised, memoir that covered her tenure as restaurant critic for the New York Times. What struck me was Reichl's struggle to review nontraditional restaurants in the Gray Lady's hidebound food section, which still embraced a Francophile worldview in the 1990s.
"Are you mad?" a friend allegedly complained to Reichl after the critic's review of Honmura An, a Japanese soba house. "People are scandalized that you have given that little noodle joint three stars. Three stars! They are saying that you will never last."
Standards have changed considerably among the country's top critics, who will happily slurp noodles for their readers in the 21st century. But will they devote a full review to, say, a pupuseria? A suburban strip-center spot that specializes in Senegalese cooking? A small storefront dedicated mostly to hummus? No, I'd say these places are, for the most part, still relegated to the margins of restaurant coverage, to columns like the $20 Diner, where they are treated, consciously or not, like second-class citizens.
By stripping this column of its previous name, I hope to remove at least one possible stigma about the restaurants that I decide to cover: that they are somehow "lesser" than the ones that might charge higher prices, have table service, offer a full bar or whatever confers prestige among diners. They are simply different in their approach. Many take just as much pride in their food as the chefs at the white-tablecloth restaurants do. I want to contribute to a society where it's possible to esteem the high and low equally, each worthy of respect for what it does well.
Officially, this column will no longer have a name. You'll just find it under my byline. My approach, however, will remain the same: I'll continue to search for the finest restaurants in the region - the ones that you may have overlooked or avoided, because, well, dining biases are deeply ingrained.

Texto completo: Q: I'm in a fast-track marketing career that usually requires an MBA from a top school, and I work about 50 hours a week. I am in a program to attain that degree, and I have one year left. My class meets 7 1/2 hours a week, and I have to study all weekend. I am also a husband and a father, which makes this schedule tough. My family has come first, then career and education, but it has to change. I just don't know what or how. An MBA from a top school would offer greater growth in my career, as well as allow us a higher standard of living. How do I choose priorities when everything is important?
A: Marrying, child rearing and being the sole supporter of your family are long-term commitments. Having an MBA degree from a top school is a valuable commodity for any job you choose, not just the one you are in now. As you have only one year remaining to obtain your MBA from a top university, it sounds like this should be your highest priority. Your degree will increase your value to any company, which, depending on your drive and work performance, will likely increase your ability to support your family in a style that can ultimately make life a bit easier.
Committing your time for the one more year it will take to graduate will also offer greater options for your wife. She may choose to stay home to create a strong bond with your child in his or her early years, and then she may return to the workplace to develop a career of her own. This could remove the pressure of you being your family's sole supporter. Earning a greater income would also allow you and your wife the ability to have another child, without sacrificing a lifestyle you both choose to live. Money is not critical to being happy, but having an abundance of it certainly cuts down on many of the hardships young couples experience in the growth years of their marriage. In the overall picture of life, a year of sacrifice could lead to far-reaching dreams for the future.
MENSA IQ ON RESUME WILL NOT HELP GET THE JOB
Q: My husband is a CPA and has an MBA from a top-five school. He also qualifies for joining MENSA and thought he would add it to his resume. I fear this would make him seem arrogant, which he is not. He is not currently job-hunting, but he wants his resume to be prepared for when he does.
A: "Mensa is the high IQ society, which provides a forum for intellectual exchange among its members in more than 100 countries around the world. Activities include the exchange of ideas through lectures, discussions, journals, special-interest groups, and local, regional, national and international gatherings; the investigations of members' opinions and attitudes; and assistance to researchers, inside and outside Mensa, in projects dealing with intelligence or Mensa."
Joining Mensa may appeal to your husband because he wants to participate in its activities, but it is not a good idea to include it on his resume. Most people, particularly those in charge of interviewing job candidates, are aware that people who graduate with an MBA from a top-five school and become a CPA are in the top level of intelligence.
While having a high IQ may be a precursor in admittance to an Ivy League or top-10 university, many employers consider a high level of emotional intelligence more important than a high IQ. According to the Institute for Health and Human Potential, the term "emotional intelligence" (EQ or EI) was coined by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer. EI is defined as "the ability to recognize, understand and manage one's own emotions, and to recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others."
According to Marc Brackett, a senior research scientist in psychology at Yale University, as cited in The New York Times, "Something we now know, from doing dozens of studies, is that emotions can either enhance or hinder your ability to learn." In the workplace, this translates to a good leader/manager can control his or her emotions and not the other way around.
Listing MENSA on a resume may seem arrogant to some, irrelevant to others. It also may offend insecure others who feel "less than" the job candidate.

Texto completo: PHOTO: Brian Stauffer
Over the past 30 years, a shrewd and expensive lobbying campaign has made Americans more tolerant of marijuana. In November 2018, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize recreational cannabis use; New Jersey and others may soon follow. Already, more than 200 million Americans live in states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. Yet even as marijuana use has become more socially acceptable, psychiatrists and epidemiologists have reached a consensus that it presents more serious risks than most people realize.
Contrary to the predictions of both advocates and opponents, legalization hasn't led to a huge increase in people using the drug casually. About 15% of Americans used cannabis at least once in 2017, up from 10% in 2006, according to the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health. By contrast, almost 70% of Americans had an alcoholic drink in the past year.
But the number of Americans who use cannabis heavily is soaring. In 2006, about 3 million Americans reported using the drug at least 300 times a year, the standard for daily use. By 2017, that number had increased to 8 million--approaching the 12 million Americans who drank every day. Put another way, only one in 15 drinkers consumed alcohol daily; about one in five marijuana users used cannabis that often.
And they are consuming cannabis that is far more potent than ever before, as measured by the amount of THC it contains. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. In the 1970s, most marijuana contained less than 2% THC. Today, marijuana routinely contains 20-25% THC, thanks to sophisticated farming and cloning techniques and to the demand of users to get a stronger high more quickly. In states where cannabis is legal, many users prefer extracts that are nearly pure THC.
Cannabis advocates often argue that the drug can't be as neurotoxic as studies suggest because otherwise Western countries would have seen population-wide increases in psychosis alongside rising marijuana use. In reality, accurately tracking psychosis cases is impossible in the U.S. The government carefully tracks diseases such as cancer with central registries, but no such system exists for schizophrenia or other severe mental illnesses.
Some population-level data does exist, though. Research from Finland and Denmark, two countries that track mental illness more accurately, shows a significant increase in psychosis since 2000, following an increase in cannabis use. And last September, a large survey found a rise in serious mental illness in the U.S. too. In 2017, 7.5% of young adults met the criteria for serious mental illness, double the rate in 2008.
None of these studies prove that rising cannabis use has caused population-wide increases in psychosis or other mental illness, although they do offer suggestive evidence of a link. What is clear is that, in individual cases, marijuana can cause psychosis, and psychosis is a high risk factor for violence. What's more, much of that violence occurs when psychotic people are using drugs. As long as people with schizophrenia are avoiding recreational drugs, they are only moderately more likely to become violent than healthy people. But when they use drugs, their risk of violence skyrockets. The drug they are most likely to use is cannabis.
The most obvious way that cannabis fuels violence in psychotic people is through its tendency to cause paranoia. Even marijuana advocates acknowledge that the drug can cause paranoia; the risk is so obvious that users joke about it, and dispensaries advertise certain strains as less likely to do so. But for people with psychotic disorders, paranoia can fuel extreme violence. A 2007 paper in the Medical Journal of Australia looked at 88 defendants who had committed homicide during psychotic episodes. It found that most of the killers believed they were in danger from the victim, and almost two-thirds reported misusing cannabis--more than alcohol and amphetamines combined.
The link between marijuana and violence doesn't appear limited to people with pre-existing psychosis. Researchers have studied alcohol and violence for generations, proving that alcohol is a risk factor for domestic abuse, assault and even murder. Far less work has been done on marijuana, in part because advocates have stigmatized anyone who raises the issue. Still, there are studies showing that marijuana use is a significant risk factor for violence.
A 2012 paper in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, examining a federal survey of more than 9,000 adolescents, found that marijuana use was associated with a doubling of domestic violence in the U.S. A 2017 paper in the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, examining drivers of violence among 6,000 British and Chinese men, found that drug use was linked to a fivefold increase in violence, and the drug used was nearly always cannabis.
Before states legalized recreational cannabis, advocates predicted that legalization would let police focus on hardened criminals rather than on marijuana smokers and thus reduce violent crime. Some advocates even claim that legalization has reduced violent crime: In a 2017 speech calling for federal legalization, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said that "these states are seeing decreases in violent crime."
But Mr. Booker is wrong. The first four states to legalize marijuana for recreational use were Colorado and Washington in 2014 and Alaska and Oregon in 2015. Combined, those four states had about 450 murders and 30,300 aggravated assaults in 2013. In 2017, they had almost 620 murders and 38,000 aggravated assaults--an increase far greater than the national average.
Knowing exactly how much of that increase is related to cannabis is impossible without researching every crime. But for centuries, people all over the world have understood that cannabis causes mental illness and violence--just as they've known that opiates cause addiction and overdose. Hard data on the relationship between marijuana and madness dates back 150 years, to British asylum registers in India.
Yet 20 years ago, the U.S. moved to encourage wider use of cannabis and opiates. In both cases, we decided we could outsmart these drugs--enjoying their benefits without their costs. And in both cases, we were wrong. Opiates are riskier than cannabis, and the overdose deaths they cause are a more imminent crisis, so public and government attention have focused on them. Soon, the mental illness and violence that follow cannabis use also may be too widespread to ignore.

Texto completo: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Wednesday night that he did not know about sexual harassment and pay disparity allegations during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Allegations from multiple women who worked on Sanders' campaign surfaced Wednesday in the New York Times. Former supporters told the Times that his campaign did not adequately address incidents of sexual harassment, sexist mistreatment and pay disparities between men and women.
On CNN, Sanders apologized to "any woman who feels like she was not treated appropriately. " When asked if he had been aware of the complaints, Sanders said, "I was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case (to be elected as president). "
The allegations and his perceived failure to rectify the issues, female campaign workers told the Times, bring into question whether he can fight for women's interests if he again seeks the presidency.
"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now, that women felt they were disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible," Sanders said on CNN.

He told CNN his campaign would do better if he pursues a 2020 presidential nomination. His 2018 Senate re-election campaign, he added, established new protocols for handling sexual harassment allegations.
"We put forward the strongest set of principles in terms of mandatory training, in terms of women, if they felt harassed, having an independent firm that they can go to," Sanders said. "And I think that that's kind of the gold standard of what we should be doing. "

These users deleted Facebook and they never looked back

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – We heard from many of you: You are not only ready to delete Facebook, but you've already done it, and are very happy you did.
Despite all the hack attacks, issues with personal data getting shared with companies and other entities, and all the apologies, I'm not quitting Facebook and I didn't think most of you would either. The positives of the social network outweigh the negative, at least for me — and many of you.
But sporting the hashtag "FacebookFreeJanuary," Jeff Johnson of New Jersey says he just quit, and he won't come back until February, encouraging others to join him as a way to lobby Facebook into changing its ways.
"There has to be some consequence that Facebook actually takes notice of," he says. Advertisers and the markets care about daily active users and monthly active users, so if Facebook's usage base takes a dip, perhaps there will be real changes, he says.
Facebook makes money by monitoring our social interactions of likes, comments and shares, and targeting us to advertisers based upon our activity.
The social network got into hot water several times in 2018 when it told politicians and users it didn't sell or share data with others, only later to reluctantly admit it had, usually with caveats. Last week, for example, after a bombshell report in the New York Times revealed Facebook shared data with companies like Microsoft and Spotify, the social network said the partnerships didn't give "companies access to information without people's permission." Many users zip through user agreements and have said they don't recall giving the companies the permission to read direct messages.
Despite the controversies, Facebook has more members now than it did at the beginning of the year — just over 2.2 billion, and it's on track to beat 2017's ad revenues, over $55 billion.
It's taken a hit on Wall Street — but so have many other tech companies as the stock market has gone south at the end of 2018.
Johnson's dream: Millions quit the service in January, causing Facebook to make substantial changes. In February, he'd like to see the social network announce a plan, in response to #JanuaryFreeFacebook, that gives users transparency and control over how their data is used. "No sneaky 'partnerships' that send our data off to others without our agreement," he says.
Mark Richardson of the San Francisco Bay Area wrote to say he deleted Facebook earlier this year, mostly because of privacy concerns. "I am happier without Facebook," he says. "The endless insight into people's thoughts and lives had a negative impact on my mental state. I don't care what some former coworker is cooking for dinner, or what an erstwhile classmate thinks of Donald Trump."
Rives McDow of Los Angeles says he quit Facebook in 2017, again, due to privacy concerns, "and this has not had any impact on my life," since.
"There are plenty of ways to do all the things that Facebook offers, and most of the ways are much more personal and involve more direct contact with people than Facebook offers," he says. "I think the impression people have about their involvement with Facebook is rooted in their illusions about their relationships with people, and this has been borne out by my experience in having relationships I have with people deepen considerably since quitting Facebook and social media in general."
Dave Hairfield from Arizona says he deleted Facebook in early December and "sometimes" misses it. "Sometimes. But when I look at my wife's FB page, it reinforces why I had to let it go. I can honestly say I am a far happier human being as a result."
Finally, Dennis Lee of Albany, Oregon, says he's happy he never signed up for Facebook to begin with. "The more I learned about their system and business model the more concerned I got about my own security, so I elected to not participate ... Allowing massive unfiltered flow of content is just not a good mix with human nature."
But, not everyone is willing to quit.
Marsha Webb told us on Twitter that Facebook is the easiest way to keep in contact with her family and stay up to date with their lives. Despite all the controversy, "I don't care what Facebook does," she wrote.
Some people are debating quitting mobile devices.

Texto completo: The second season of "grown-ish" debuts on Freeform. And the acclaimed sophomore season of "Atlanta" is now available to stream on Hulu.
What's on TV
GROWN-ISH 8 p.m. on Freeform. When this spinoff of Kenya Barris's "black-ish" debuted at the beginning of last year, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times that the series -- which follows Yara Shahidi's character, Zoey, as she goes off to college -- "just needs a semester or two away from home." The spinoff, like its lead character, was still finding its own voice, a coarser one than its parent program thanks to being on cable and about college students. Zoey returns to school for her sophomore year in the show's second season, which debuts with two new episodes Wednesday night. In the new season, Zoey moves into an off-campus apartment, rekindles a romance and navigates a social sphere defined by hashtags and status updates.
MYTHBUSTERS JR. 9 p.m. on Science Channel. Adam Savage's rise to fame was marked by explosions. As the bubblier half of the hosting team behind "Mythbusters," Savage has been seen testing such questions as whether a bullet fired through a plane window can cause explosive decompression and whether using a cellphone at a gas station can cause a caller to go up in flames. He returns in this spinoff series, which features Savage alongside a panel of children working to test the veracity of yet more myths.
LONE SURVIVOR (2013) 7:25 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. on FXM. Peter Berg's terse adaptation of a 2007 war memoir by Marcus Luttrell casts Mark Wahlberg as a Navy SEAL dropped by helicopter into a morally complicated combat situation in Afghanistan. His fellow SEALs are played by Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that "Lone Survivor" is "a modest, competent, effective movie, concerned above all with doing the job of explaining how the job was done."
What's Streaming
ATLANTA on Hulu. Actors from Donald Glover's surreal comedy series were peppered throughout some of the most talked-about movies of 2018: Lakeith Stanfield led the absurdist satire "Sorry to Bother You"; Zazie Beetz played opposite Ryan Reynolds in "Deadpool 2"; and Brian Tyree Henry delivered a memorable monologue in "If Beale Street Could Talk." So those who have yet to dive into "Atlanta" may find more familiar faces here than they would have earlier in the year, when the second season aired. That season -- which is now available to stream on Hulu -- has what The Times called one of the most memorable TV episodes of 2018, in which Glover, in whiteface, plays the eccentric owner of an eerie mansion. "The storytelling in 'Atlanta' is dreamlike, which is another way of saying that it's unusually realistic," Poniewozik wrote in his review of the second season for The Times. "As in life, weird or comical developments don't announce themselves before they happen: They just start happening, and your consciousness has to catch up."

Texto completo: In her essay "Why Are Young People Having So Little Sex?" Kate Julian takes a question that seems to have a simple answer (porn) and shows that it has a complex answer. In one striking part of the essay, which appeared in The Atlantic, Julian shows that fewer young people are having the kind of relationships that lead to sex. In 1995, 74 percent of 17-year-old women had had a special romantic relationship in the preceding 18 months. By 2014, only 46 percent of 17-year-olds had ever had a romantic relationship of any kind.
Having lived much of their social life online, many young people expressed concern that they hadn't developed the skills they needed to read possible partners in live, face-to-face situations. How do you tell if someone thinks you are special or just wants to be friends? In addition, nearly a fifth of Americans ages 18 to 29 believe that a man inviting a woman out for a drink "always" or "usually" constitutes sexual harassment.
The essay is among this year's Sidney Awards, which I give for outstanding long-form journalism.
From The New Yorker, I recommend Dexter Filkins' "A Saudi Prince's Quest to Remake the Middle East." In one essay, Filkins weaves together the Middle East's geostrategic situation, its economic situation and how each of the major players, from Jared Kushner to Iran, is grasping for something.
It's all built around a profile of Mohammed bin Salman, the young Saudi leader. Years ago, MBS asked a Saudi bureaucrat to help him appropriate a property. When the official said no, he received an envelope with a single bullet inside. Last year, MBS replaced Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. Bin Nayef had been summoned to the palace and surrounded by guards. His cellphone was taken away and he was forced to stand for hours - in excruciating pain because of an old injury. Just before dawn, bin Nayef agreed to surrender his position.
In "The Constitution of Knowledge," in National Affairs, Jonathan Rauch argues that the marketplace of ideas is like a funnel. Millions of people float millions of hypotheses every day. Society collectively tests these ideas, bats them around or ignores them, and only a tiny few make it out the narrow end of the funnel, where they are declared useful or true.
But, Rauch says, the funnel is no more. Internet trolls simply overwhelm the system with swarms of falsehood. There used to be an implicit honor code - truth exists, credentials matter, what hasn't been tested isn't knowledge - but the honor code has been swept away. Most fringe information used to get ignored. But today, it can't be ignored because a lot of it is spewed by the president of the United States. Rauch shows that the national conversation had an architecture, which has now been reduced to sand.
It's hard to write about what religious faith feels like. Tish Harrison Warren does it compellingly in "True Story" in The Point. As a kid she just loved going to church. Then as an adult she learned about the church's sins - the narcissism, abuse, sexism. But she still became an Anglican priest. The nice side of church, she writes, is the day-to-day goodness, the teenage boy still sweet enough to rest his head on his mother's shoulder during the sermon, the young man who gives an elderly friend a ride, the way the members see themselves as a community of forgiven sinners.
"Each Sunday during communion, when the members of my church come to the table, I watch their faces. Many tired. Some sad. Some lit up with joy. One kid who has special needs approaches me like he's won the lottery. His voice rises, Oh boy! Oh boy!'"
Chinese art prices are through the roof. In 2010, a vase with a starting price of $800,000 sold in a suburban London auction for $69.5 million. Coincidentally, Chinese art is now routinely looted from Western art museums. In "The Great Chinese Art Heist," in GQ, Alex Palmer walks us through these "Mission Impossible"-style robberies. He also captures the nationalist fervor driving the frenzy.
Most of these pieces were looted from China centuries ago by foreign soldiers. The price of each piece is determined partly by quality, but also by how closely it is associated with one of China's most inglorious defeats. Stealing the items back is nationalist revenge.
I mentioned in my last column that there were several excellent essays this year on tigers. My favorite is "Man-eaters" in The Ringer, in which Brian Phillips explains: "The arrival of a tiger, it's true, is often preceded by moments of rising tension, because a tiger's presence changes the jungle around it, and those changes are easier to detect. Birdcalls darken. Small deer call softly to each other. Herds do not run but drift into shapes that suggest some emerging group consciousness of an escape route."
Sidney nominees are gathered by a completely haphazard, random process. But I couldn't do it at all without the annual help of Robert Cottrell of The Browser; Robert Atwan, who directs the Best American Essays series; and Conor Friedersdorf, who produces a Best of Journalism newsletter each week.

Texto completo: BUENOS AIRES -- Héctor Timerman, a former Argentine foreign minister who was charged with treason in 2013 for his role in negotiating an agreement with Iran relating to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, died on Sunday at his home here. He was 65.
His lawyer, Graciana Peñafort, said the cause was respiratory failure. Mr. Timerman had been under treatment for liver cancer, she said.
"He was very deteriorated physically, and his heart simply did not tolerate any more," Ms. Peñafort said.
Mr. Timerman was foreign minister under President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner from 2010 until 2015, the year she left office. His tenure was marked by increasing tension between Argentina and the United States. He had served as Argentina's ambassador in Washington from 2007 to 2010.
The memorandum of understanding that Mr. Timerman signed with Iran in 2013 was billed as an effort to get answers from the Iranians who were accused of carrying out the suicide bombing of the Jewish community center, the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association, or AMIA, in which 85 people were killed and some 300 injured.
The deal, which called for the two countries to set up a joint commission to investigate the bombing, was approved by Congress but later declared unconstitutional. Iran has long denied any involvement in the bombing, for which no one has been convicted.
In 2006, Argentine prosecutors accused top Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, as well as Imad Mugniyah, a Lebanese senior commander of the militant group Hezbollah, with being involved in the attack. Mr. Mugniyah was assassinated in 2008, and Mr. Rafsanjani died in 2017.
The federal prosecutor Alberto Nisman characterized the agreement with Iran as part of a cover-up to ensure that Iranians would never face justice. He contended that the memorandum was the first step toward canceling fugitive notices, known as red notices, that had been filed with Interpol, the international police organization; the notices had prevented the suspects from traveling freely.
Shorty after he made the accusation against Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman, Mr. Nisman, in January 2015, was found dead in his luxury apartment in Buenos Aires with a gunshot wound to the head. The death remains unsolved.
In December 2017, a federal judge, Claudio Bonadio, ordered that Mr. Timerman and several other key officials in Mrs. Kirchner's government be taken into custody for their role in the agreement with Iran. Mr. Timerman was granted home detention because of his illness.
Judge Bonadio said there was enough evidence to indict Mrs. Kirchner and her former allies for treason because they had sought "impunity for the Iranian nationals accused of the attack on the AMIA headquarters and to normalize relations between the two states."
Shortly after the judge's decision, The New York Times published an opinion piece by Mr. Timerman in which he called himself a "political prisoner."
As part of his indictment, Judge Bonadio also claimed that Ronald K. Noble, an American citizen and a former New York University law professor who led Interpol from 2000 to 2014, was also part of the cover-up.
Mr. Noble has disputed that accusation.
He wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Mr. Timerman had "died under a cloud of false accusations because #Argentina's judiciary failed to conduct a thorough investigation."
Also on Twitter, Mrs. Kirchner said that Mr. Timerman, as a Jew, had been particularly interested in making sure that those who carried out the 1994 bombing were brought to justice.
"Héctor got sick due to the pain and suffering provoked by the irrational and unjust attack that we both suffered due to the signing of the memorandum of understanding with Iran," Mrs. Kirchner wrote.
Mr. Timerman's efforts to receive medical treatment in the United States were derailed when his American visa was canceled following the indictment. Although the visa was reinstated, allowing him to travel, supporters say the lapse cost him precious time.
"His respiratory issue was the tragic result in the delay of being able to travel to the United States in January 2018," Ms. Peñafort, his lawyer, said in a text message. "When he finally got to the United States, it was too late to carry out the treatment that would have improved his living conditions in these last months."
Before joining the government, Mr. Timerman was a journalist, following in the footsteps of his father, Jacobo Timerman, a prominent journalist who was imprisoned and tortured by the brutal military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1976 to 1981. Jacobo Timerman's case inspired an international human rights furor, which led to his release.
Héctor Timerman was born in Buenos Aires on Dec. 16, 1953. He got his start as a journalist at publications his father helped start. From 1978 to 1984 he lived in exile in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from Columbia University in 1981. He became a naturalized American citizen but gave up his citizenship in 2006.
In addition to his work as a journalist, Mr. Timerman was also a human-rights activist and a founder of the human rights group Americas Watch.
He is survived by his wife, Anabel Sielecki, and two daughters, Amanda and Jordana.
