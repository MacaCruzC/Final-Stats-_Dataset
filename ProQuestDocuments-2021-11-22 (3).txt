Texto completo: EXETER, N.H. - Former Vice President Joe Biden is accustomed to fielding questions from voters about picking a running mate. But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?
"The answer is I would, but I can't think of one now," Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, New Hampshire, drawing laughter from the crowd.
Biden then elaborated on what he meant. "There are some really decent Republicans that are out there still, out here's the problem right now o: the well-known ones: They've got to step up," he said.
Biden hasemphasized the need for a future Democratic president toworkwitl Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus in order to gst things done. That viewpoint las been criticized by some literals who see it as an unacceptable embrace of the status quo and others who think Biden is naive about trying to work with Republicans.
But choosing a Republican to be his running mate would be a far more grievous act in the eyes of many Democrats, something many party officials and both liberal and moderate activists would oppose.
On Monday, Biden made a point of noting that it was presumptuous to talk about a running mate, given that he has not won the Democratic nomination. He went on to recall his working relationship with President Barack Obama and their trust for each other, telling the crowd, "The only thing I know about is the qualifications for vice president."
As for his own vice-presidential pick, Biden noted that there were "a lot of qualified women" and "a lot of qualified African Americans."
"There's a plethora of really qualified people," he said. "Whomever I would pick were I fortunate enough to be your nominee, I'd pick someone who was simpático with me."
Biden, like other presidential candidates, has been largely circumspect about naming names, though he did say this month that he would consider a former rival in the race, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, as a possible running mate.

Education Official
Fired After Arrest
A deputy chief of staff to New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza was arrested in Wisconsin, where he was charged with using a computer to facilitate a child sex crime, a city official said Monday.
David Hay has been terminated, a Department of Education spokeswoman said.
Mr. Hay became deputy chief of staff in October 2018, helping to organize Mr. Carranza's equity agenda. Department of Education officials said he didn't have regular contact with children in his role.
"These allegations are incredibly disturbing and absolutely unacceptable," department spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said by email. "We took immediate action removing Mr. Hay from payroll and are terminating him."
Anastasia Coleman, special commissioner of investigation for the city's school district, said SCI is looking into the matter and declined to comment further.
Mr. Hay was arrested Sunday by police in Neenah, Wis. He couldn't be reached for comment, and it couldn't be determined if he had a lawyer. The New York Times earlier reported the arrest and firing.
Mr. Hay began working with the city Department of Education in 2016, serving as an adviser to then-Chancellor Carmen Farina, according to his LinkedIn page. It said he had worked as a high school principal in two Wisconsin districts.

NEW YORK
Minimum Wage
Changes Take Effect
The minimum wage is rising to $15 for all workers in New York City -- making it among the first places in the country to reach the goal sought by many labor activists.
Workers elsewhere in the state will make less: $13 in the city's near suburbs and $11.80 upstate. The changes took effect Tuesday.
In 2013, New York raised the minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 for non-tipped workers. A 2016 law called for the state to eventually raise its minimum wage to $15, but phased it in at different rates for New York City, the suburbs and upstate. The law also gave New York City employers with 10 or fewer workers an extra year to make it to $15.
Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has praised the rate, which has gone up at a time when unemployment is historically low at 4% in New York. His administration recently released a report that cited such unemployment figures and rising average wages, and found "negligible, if any impacts" on labor demands throughout the state.
Critics have said businesses might be forced to cut hours and jobs because of the hike.

CONNECTICUT
Man Loses Appeal
Over Revenge Plot
A federal appeals court rejected the appeal Monday of a former Connecticut police officer convicted of trying to get the judge in his home-foreclosure case in trouble with the IRS through a bogus tax filing.
A three-judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York dismissed the arguments of Raymond McLaughlin, who said the federal court system had no jurisdiction over him.
The judges called Mr. McLaughlin's position consistent with the "Sovereign Citizen" ideology in which proponents believe the federal government is illegitimate. The ruling said Mr. McLaughlin's argument "raises an issue that warrants a clear statement from this Court, to deter future litigants from making similar claims."
A federal jury in Hartford convicted Mr. McLaughlin, a former Windsor police officer, in 2018 of making a false statement on a federal tax form. He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.
Federal prosecutors said Mr. McLaughlin, of East Hartford, sent documents to the Internal Revenue Service in 2014 falsely stating that he had paid Judge Robert Vacchelli and the court system about $332,000, with the apparent goal of getting the judge in trouble with the IRS for not paying taxes on that income.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is moving its headquarters to Times Square.
The former three-term New York City mayor announced to staff Monday that his new campaign headquarters will open in early January on the eighth floor of 229 W. 43rd St., the building previously home to the New York Times.
The move comes slightly more than a month after the billionaire businessman launched his late Democratic presidential bid. With more than 300 staffers, the campaign has outgrown its current headquarters on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a campaign spokesperson said.
The new campaign headquarters will occupy one floor of the historic Midtown building and include an open-office layout -- a design the 77-year-old former mayor used both at City Hall and at his company, Bloomberg LP.
"Walls just get in the way, by stifling communication and making collaboration more difficult," Mr. Bloomberg said in an email to staff Monday. "Some people like to build walls. I like to tear them down."
"My desk will be out in the open like everyone else's, and I'll be coming by to see how each team is doing," Mr. Bloomberg said.
The campaign headquarters also will display countdown clocks like those he used in City Hall. These clocks will show the number of days until Super Tuesday and the general election -- March 3 and November 3, respectively -- his staff note. The office's conference rooms and other spaces will be named after states and the number of delegates each one sends to the Democratic National Convention, which is slated for July in Milwaukee.
If he makes it to the White House, Mr. Bloomberg told staff, he would transform the East Room "into an open office environment, where I'll sit side by side with our team." He said he would use the Oval Office "for some official functions."
A representative from Columbia Property Trust, which owns the office space in the building, declined to comment. Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law, also owns several floors of the building.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has in recent weeks opened offices in states including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, with plans to open more in other states. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the Bloomberg campaign plans to keep staffers and offices in six battleground states through the general election, even if Mr. Bloomberg isn't the presidential nominee.
Since joining the crowded 2020 Democratic field in late November, Mr. Bloomberg has expanded his campaign efforts in New York in the months before the state's April 28 presidential primary.
One of the world's richest people, Mr. Bloomberg has said he would self-fund his campaign. Just before entering the race, he launched a $100 million digital-advertising campaign, targeting Mr. Trump.

EXETER, N.H. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is accustomed to fielding questions from voters about picking a running mate. But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?
"The answer is I would, but I can't think of one now," Mr. Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, N.H., drawing laughter from the crowd.

Mr. Biden has emphasized the need for a future Democratic president to work with Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus in order to get things done. That viewpoint has been criticized by some liberals who see it as an unacceptable embrace of the status quo and think Mr. Biden is naïve about trying to work with Republicans. But choosing a Republican to be his running mate would be a far more grievous act in the eyes of many Democrats, something many party officials and both liberal and moderate activists would oppose.
On Monday, Mr. Biden made a point of noting that it was presumptuous to talk about a running mate, given that he has not won the Democratic nomination. He went on to recall his working relationship with President Barack Obama and their trust for each other, telling the crowd, "The only thing I know about is the qualifications for vice president."
As for his own vice-presidential pick, Mr. Biden noted that there were "a lot of qualified women" and "a lot of qualified African-Americans."
"There's a plethora of really qualified people," he said. "Whomever I would pick were I fortunate enough to be your nominee, I'd pick someone who was simpatico with me."
Mr. Biden, like other presidential candidates, has been largely circumspect about naming names, though he did say this month that he would consider a former rival in the race, Senator Kamala Harris of California, as a possible running mate. He also said that he would consider another primary rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
In November, Mr. Biden referenced four female Democrats as possible running mates: Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of New Hampshire; Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and the party's nominee for governor there in 2018; and Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by President Trump in 2017. Mr. Biden did not name the women, but rather referred to them indirectly -- in the case of Ms. Abrams, as "the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia."

Texto completo: Evangelicals who minimize the importance of President Donald Trump's judicial appointments betray a naivete about the perils to religious liberty in the United States, perils that have been growing over the past decade.
Many people, outside of the relatively small group of constitutional law professors and Supreme Court and appeals courts practitioners, may not grasp the sheer number of cases on the religious clauses of the First Amendment that have reached the high court in recent years. Six of these cases illustrate the stakes. (There are scores more religious liberty cases that are resolved in federal district and circuit courts, as clashes between the world of faith and the vast administrative state in the United States accelerate.)
In 2014, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , the Supreme Court decided, by a 5-4 vote, that the Affordable Care Act's mandate that for-profit corporations supply their employees with contraceptives - even forms of contraception violating the corporations' owners' beliefs - was barred by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Had the court majority gone the other way, there is no doubt that Hobby Lobby, a company employing 32,000, would have closed. The Green family, who owns that company, was not going to "bend the knee" to the demands of the government had they lost. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia sided with the company's religious liberty interests.
Also in 2014, in the case Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court - again by a vote of 5-4 and again with Kennedy and Scalia in the majority - held that a town's practice of opening its town board meetings with a prayer offered by members of the clergy did not violate the Constitution's establishment clause because that practice was consistent with the tradition long followed by Congress and state legislatures. Greece did not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who offered prayers, and the prayers did not coerce participation by anyone. Secular absolutists wanted this and similar practices in other jurisdictions banned.
The court in 2017, by a vote of 7-2, ruled in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer that excluding religious organizations from aid programs run by governments violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. That two members of the court thought religious preschools were banned from state grants to upgrade playgrounds for safety purposes illustrates just how extreme is the anti-religion animus among some within the judiciary.
The court's 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission upheld the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, but only because the Colorado Civil Rights Commission seemed hostile toward religion. Don't be misled by the 7--2 vote. It was a very close-run decision. Meanwhile, the persecution of the baker by Colorado's extreme anti-faith militants has continued.
The court, also in 2018 and again by a 5-4 vote, held in National Institute of Family Life Advocates v. Becerra that a California law violated the First Amendment because it required "pro-life" pregnancy centers to provide notices about the availability of abortion services. These centers are almost always run by faith-based groups. The California law was a "jam down" statute by the abortion-rights forces dominant in the California legislature, which has moved further to the left in recent years.
The Supreme Court held the line against absurd interpretations of the Constitution's bar on establishment of religion in 2019's American Legion v. American Humanist Association. Although the lower court had ordered the demolition of a large cross that had stood in a public park in Maryland for a century, the court - voting 7-2 - held that the display and maintenance of such a large memorial by a local government did not violate the establishment clause. Keep in mind the lower court had held exactly the opposite.
Battles over religious liberty continue. The court has recently agreed to review decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit crucial to the future of religious education. The high court's decision should arrive by June. In this proceeding, the decisions of two Catholic schools - St. James School in Torrance, Calif., and Our Lady of Guadalupe School in Hermosa Beach. Calif. - concerning two teachers and whether they could continue to teach at these schools were upheld by trial courts but reversed by two different panels of the 9th Circuit, thought the most liberal circuit court in the country. This is a major free-exercise case that will affect tens of thousands of faith-based schools.
Critics of the president who play down the importance of Mr. Trump's judicial appointments make an enormous mistake. For those whose faith is crucial to their lives, "Trump judges" make all the difference in the world.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: From a Civil War Battle To Arguments Over Trump's Impeachment

Texto completo: [Stonewall]
One article of impeachment drafted by House Democrats against President Trump outlines a charge officially known as "obstruction of Congress," but politicians and pundits alike often favor giving it a snappier one-word label: "stonewalling."
The impeachment resolution passed by the House alleges that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit him politically and that he obstructed Congress by preventing officials from testifying and blocking the release of related records.
As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler put it during the impeachment debate on Dec. 18, "President Trump stonewalled Congress's investigation to cover up his misconduct." Mr. Nadler's counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, echoed the phrasing, saying that Republicans had "made their choice, despite this president and the White House stonewalling every subpoena, every request for witnesses and testimony from this coequal branch of government." (The Trump administration has said it is essentially boycotting an episode of partisan overreach.)
The "stone wall" metaphor might seem straightforward to describe obstructive or uncooperative procedural tactics. But the historical route of "stonewalling" into U.S. politics has been circuitous.
The immovable metaphor is most famously associated with Thomas Jonathan Jackson, a Confederate general in the Civil War who stubbornly held his ground at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. As the story goes, an officer yelled out, "There stands Jackson like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!" The "Stonewall" nickname stuck as his military exploits grew legendary.
Yet Stonewall Jackson was never described as "stonewalling." Australian cricketers turned the word into a verb of obstruction. As used in cricket slang Down Under, "stonewalling" in the late 19th century described a batter playing defensively by continually blocking balls rather than trying to score.
That obstinacy was transferred to Australia's political arena, with "stonewalling" used to refer to obstructive parliamentary tactics. In 1875, when liberal leader Graham Berry lost his power as premier in the state of Victoria, his backers became known as "stonewallers" thanks to their dogged opposition to the conservative government.
"Stonewalling" remained rarely used in the U.S. through much of the 20th century. A New York Times columnist wrote in 1958 that Dwight Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, was "stonewalling for time in order to close the missile gap" with the Soviet Union. But it was Richard Nixon's administration that turned "stonewalling" into a regular item in the political lexicon. William Safire, who worked as a speechwriter for Nixon, recalled first hearing the term in late 1969 from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who complained that "the North Vietnamese are stonewalling us."
The Watergate tapes offer a glimpse of how the usage spread within the White House. On one tape from February 1973, White House counsel John Dean told the president, "We are stonewalling totally." Nixon picked up on the term a month later, telling his associates, "I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else." That led Congress to draft a charge of obstruction of justice as one of Nixon's articles of impeachment.
Many political scholars see Mr. Trump's resistance as going further. Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman observed in a Bloomberg opinion column that "no other president has ever stonewalled Congress entirely when it comes to impeachment," since even Nixon "allowed some executive branch witnesses to testify and provided some documents to Congress." Time, and a Senate trial, will tell whether cracks may emerge in Trump's stone wall.

Texto completo: Readers react to an editorial in Christianity Today that harshly criticized the president.
To the Editor:
Re "Evangelicals Closing Ranks With President" (front page, Dec. 21), about reaction to a Christianity Today editorial calling for President Trump's removal:
When I was a child, the parable about George Washington confessing to cutting down the cherry tree left several questions floating around in my head, but the message was clear -- telling the truth is a fundamental virtue exemplified by the first president of our great country.
Our current president provides a shocking contrast and shameful example to Americans of all ages. He repeatedly, publicly and unapologetically violates nearly all the moral precepts fundamental to every religious community in our country. Yet until the clear and bold statement from an important portion of the evangelical Christian community, most of our religious leaders have been silent while the president disregards and undermines core values they spend their lives professing.
I helped organize and worked closely with Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders in the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I deeply respect their faith, appreciate the organizational constraints within which they exercise leadership and have applauded their courageous public statements. But their remarkable silence in the face of the president's abject immorality is an abdication of their leadership responsibility, and undermines the credibility of the faith communities to which they have dedicated their lives.
Does it take the fresh eyes and innocence of a child to say, "The emperor has no clothes"?
Bruce E. Wexler
New Haven
The writer, a professor of psychiatry at Yale, served as convener of the National Interreligious Leadership Initiative for Peace in the Middle East.
To the Editor:
Like many Americans, I don't like President Trump's rude and hostile tweets and comments; I abhor his lack of both repentance and humility. For these reasons, as an evangelical Christian, I would never hold up Mr. Trump as an example of someone who lives out his Christian faith. But morality has never been a qualification for the office of president.
We Christians should understand what the left really wants, and it isn't a president of high moral standing. Among other objectives, what many on the left really want is to trample our right to exercise our religious beliefs as we see fit.
Many on the left are up in arms because some Christians do not want to do things that conflict with their religious beliefs, like provide abortion services or wedding services for same-sex couples. We may or may not agree with these beliefs, but we should support the right of our fellow Christians and people of other faiths to believe these things. Mr. Trump will support those rights; Democrats would trample them.
Our country and our Christian faith can survive immoral presidents; we have done so in the past. Surviving a president who will wreck our country's longstanding and constitutionally guaranteed right of religious liberty will be much harder.

To the Editor:
Re "That Editorial Won't Sway Evangelicals" (Op-Ed, Dec. 23):
Sarah Posner misses the point about the Christianity Today editorial that held President Trump accountable because he "attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents." The editor showed immense courage by not only observing that Mr. Trump violated the Constitution but also saying his actions are "profoundly immoral."
The point is not that the editorial was going to sway entrenched so-called Christians who have embraced a hate-filled and racist-supporting president. The point is that it told the truth about a man who garners evangelical support "in spite of his blackened moral record," as the editor said.
I am not aware of any publication on the right that has spoken the truth about this president and risked his wrath and the virulent attacks from a base that brooks no critique of its hero. Hats off to Mark Galli, the magazine's editor in chief.

Texto completo: The killings of three women and six children, members of a binational community that farms land in northern Mexico, reverberated worldwide.
MEXICO CITY -- The police chief of a small town near Mexico's border with the United States has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the massacre of nine women and children of a Mormon family last month, the Mexican authorities said Friday.
The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora.
Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico's Public Security Ministry said.
He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three woman and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations.
The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group.
The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation.
Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. "It's common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals," he said by telephone from Chihuahua.
"They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children," he said. "These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves."
Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November.
The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime.
But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed. The authorities did not arrive at the scene until 10 hours later, Mr. LeBarón said.
"I've been marching in Mexico and speaking out against the violence," he said. "And I have never seen a case where a victim has had justice." Mr. LeBarón's brother was killed 10 years ago when he stood up to local gangs and nobody has been tried for that crime, he said.
"The justice system has collapsed," he said. "The impunity rate is almost 100 percent."

David Leonhardt: The press has a bias for centrism, and calls it objectivity

Texto completo: John F. Harris is about as mainstream as the mainstream media gets. He spent 21 years at The Washington Post, including as its political editor. Then he became the founding editor of Politico, where he is now a columnist.
Last month, Harris wrote a column that I can’t get out of my head. In it, he argued that political journalism suffers from “centrist bias.” As he explained, “This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”
The bias caused much of the media to underestimate Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Donald Trump in 2016. It also helps explain the negative tone running through a lot of the coverage of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this year.
Centrist bias, as I see it, confuses the idea of centrism (which is very much an ideology) with objectivity and fairness. It’s an understandable confusion, because American politics is dominated by the two major parties, one on the left and one on the right. And the overwhelming majority of journalists at so-called mainstream outlets — national magazines, newspapers, public radio, the non-Fox television networks — really are doing their best to treat both parties fairly.
In doing so, however, they often make an honest mistake: They equate balance with the midpoint between the two parties’ ideologies. Over the years, many press critics have pointed out one weakness of this approach: false equivalence, the refusal to consider the possibility that one side of an argument is simply (or mostly) right.
But that’s not the only problem. There’s also the possibility that both political parties have been wrong about something and that the solution, rather than being roughly halfway between their answers, is different from what either has been proposing.
This seemingly radical possibility turns out to be quite common, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. — author of the classic book “The Vital Center,” no less — pointed out. The abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, labor rights, the New Deal, civil rights for black Americans, Reagan’s laissez-faire revolution and same-sex marriage all started outside the boundaries of what either party favored. “The most consequential history,” Harris wrote, “is usually not driven by the center.”
Political and economic journalism too often assumes otherwise and treats the center as inherently sensible. This year’s Democratic presidential campaign has been a good case study. The skeptical questions posed to the more moderate Democrats are frequently about style or tactics: Are you too old? Too young? Too rich? Too far behind in the polls?
The skeptical questions for the more progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, often challenge the substance of their ideas: Are you too radical? Are you being realistic? And, by golly, how would you pay for it all?
I recently took a detailed look through the coverage of the wealth tax, favored by both Sanders and Warren, and centrist bias seeps through much of it. The coverage has slanted negative, filled with the worries that centrists have — that the tax wouldn’t work in practice or would slow economic growth.
Experts who favor a wealth tax, like Gene Sperling, Felicia Wong and Heather Boushey, or whose academic research suggests it would work, like Lily Batchelder and David Kamin, have received less attention than experts who don’t like the idea. For that matter, the complaints of obscure billionaires have gotten more attention than the arguments of sympathetic experts. “Billionaire whining about a wealth tax,” as Ilyana Kuziemko, a Princeton economist who’s sympathetic to a wealth tax, told me, mostly isn’t newsworthy.
I’m not suggesting that journalists lather the wealth tax with praise. There are real questions about it, and journalists are supposed to be skeptical. I’m also not suggesting that Sanders or Warren is necessarily the best nominee. As regular readers know, I’m a moderate on Medicare, immigration and college debt, among other subjects. John Harris, for his part, confesses to “a pretty strong bout” of centrist bias.
But maybe that’s why we recognize it and pine for more objective coverage. Not every policy question posed to Democrats needs to have a conservative assumption, and not every question posed to Republicans needs to have a liberal one. If Warren and Sanders are going to be asked whether their solutions go too far, Joe Biden should be asked whether his solutions are too timid: Mr. Vice President, many economists believe that inequality is bad for an economy, so are you doing enough to attack inequality?
Once you start thinking about centrist bias, you recognize a lot of it. It helps explain why the 2016 presidential debates focused more on the budget deficit, a topic of centrist zealotry, than climate change, almost certainly a bigger threat. (Well-funded deficit advocacy plays a role too.) Centrist bias also helps explain the credulousness of early coverage during the Iraq and Vietnam wars. Both Democrats and Republicans, after all, largely supported each war.
The world is more surprising and complicated than centrist bias imagines it to be. Sometimes, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are right. Even when they’re not, they deserve the same skepticism that other politicians do — no less, no more.

Resumen: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Wausau rethinking snowball fight ban

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Wausau might retract its ban on snowball fights after the question of whether you can legally throw a snowball at a friend has again drawn the attention of national media outlets.
After some national headlines this month called Wausau "the worst town in America" for outlawing snowball fights, the City Council will consider removing the word "snowball" from the ordinance at its next meeting on Jan. 14.
It was first discussed in a public health and safety committee meeting on Dec. 16.
The city has had some fun with the attention, though. The police department and City Hall cleared it up with a video explaining the snowball ordinance, where Deputy Chief Matt Barnes threw a snowball right at the back of Mayor Robert Mielke's head. (He wasn't cited for the incident.)
The video didn't spell the end of Wausau's national attention this holiday season, though.
The Associated Press recently wrote a story about a potential end to the snowball ordinance. It was picked up by newspapers like the Chicago Tribune, which published it Monday, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
On Tuesday, the New York Times published its own story about the snowball ordinance and the police department's video, making Wausau a national Christmas story this week.
The law on snowballs is a small part of a larger ordinance that bans people from throwing objects such as stones, arrows and yes, even snowballs, on city-owned property.
Lisa Rasmussen, City Council president, told the Associated Press it was time to reconsider the ordinance because of recent negative national attention.
Those stories included inaccurate details, such as suggesting the ordinance was recently adopted. It's actually from 1962, Barnes said.
Not to mention that the ban on snowball fights is rarely enforced. Police have written citations under the ordinance only about 10 times in the last 15 years, Barnes said.
Wausau's ordinance drew national attention after WASW-TV published a story the day before Thanksgiving. It got picked up by national outlets that wrote "factually inaccurate" articles, Barnes said.
This is not the first time the city's snowball ordinance has garnered national attention. The ordinance was mentioned on a travel blog and legal website in 2016.
Here's the full text of Wausau ordinance 9.08.020 "No person shall throw or shoot any object, arrow, stone, snowball or other missile or projectile, by hand or by any other means, at any other person or at, in or into any building, street, sidewalk, alley, highway, park, playground or other public place within the city. This subsection shall not apply to archery ranges under the supervision of the park and recreation committee, nor shall it apply to the bow hunting provisions within 9.08.010."

Texto completo: He is believed to have wielded the knife that killed her, the police said.
Two weeks after an intensive manhunt for a 14-year-old linked to the killing of Tessa Majors, police officers finally located the teenager on Thursday at a family member's home in the Bronx.
The authorities believed that the teenager's family was shielding him until a mark on his hand healed, an official briefed on the case said. The official described the mark as consistent with a bite.
But just hours later, after he was questioned by the police, the 14-year-old was released on Thursday afternoon. It was unclear whether he would be charged in the murder of Ms. Majors, the Barnard College student who was found bleeding to death earlier this month just outside Morningside Park in Manhattan.
The police have said that Ms. Majors bit one of her three attackers during a park mugging, and that the 14-year-old is believed to be the person who wielded the knife that killed her.
Initial DNA tests performed in the case have been inconclusive, the official said, adding that the authorities were hoping that pending test results would provide crucial information. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The interview with the 14-year-old came a week after the Police Department had taken the unusual step of releasing a photo of a minor in an effort to find him. The chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, announced on Thursday morning that the teenager was in custody, to the relief of police officials who are under pressure to solve the first high-profile murder under the new police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea.
But after several hours of questioning at the 26th Precinct station house in Morningside Heights, near where the killing took place, the 14-year-old was released without being charged.
"This was a significant development in the investigation process," Chief Harrison said at around 2:40 p.m. "Although he has since been released to the custody of his attorneys, the investigation remains very active."
Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem, which is representing the teenager, declined to comment.
Ms. Majors's murder jolted a city now accustomed to low rates of violent crime, and it recalled an era three decades ago, when many parks were considered dangerous to enter after dark.
The case also evoked memories of the infamous attack on a jogger in Central Park in April 1989, and the police have been proceeding cautiously. In the 1989 case, the police and prosecutors obtained confessions from several teenagers through tough interrogation techniques. Those confessions turned out to be false.
Mark Levine, the City Council member who represents Morningside Heights, said the 14-year-old's release "has confused people in the community."
"Some wondered if the case is not strong," Mr. Levine said. "In truth, investigators are proceeding with enormous caution."
Ms. Majors, who had moved to New York from Virginia to attend Barnard months earlier, was walking in Morningside Park the night of Dec. 11 when, the police said, at least three teenagers, ages 13 and 14, tried to rob her.
She struggled, and one of her assailants stabbed her with a knife several times, the police said. A campus security guard found her fatally wounded on a sidewalk, just outside the park near West 116th Street and Morningside Drive.
A 13-year-old was arrested the next day and gave statements to the police implicating himself and two 14-year-old middle school classmates in the crime. According to two detectives who have testified at hearings, the teenager, whom The New York Times is not naming because he is not being charged as an adult, said his friends grabbed Ms. Majors from behind and took a plastic bag from her pocket. Then one stabbed her as she fought back, the 13-year-old told the police, recalling that the feathers from her down coat floated in the air.
The police tried to interview one of the 14-year-olds, but he requested a lawyer and declined to give a statement. He was released on Dec. 12.
For weeks, detectives were unable to locate the second 14-year-old. The department distributed photographs of him nine days after the murder and asked for the public's help.
The Times generally does not publish photos of minors accused of crimes.
At a news conference last week, Mr. Shea said he was troubled by the ages of people tied to an uptick of robberies in pockets of the city, including the neighborhood where Ms. Majors was attacked.
"Thirteen is young," Mr. Shea said. "I mean, I think it should disturb any New Yorker when we have a child involved in something this serious."
A public defender for the 13-year-old, who took the case after the police interviewed the teenager, has laid the groundwork to challenge his confession -- pointing out in court that even though the teenager was accompanied by his uncle when he met with detectives, the police used some techniques that might call the reliability of his statements into question.
Specifically, the defense lawyer, Hannah Kaplan of the Legal Aid Society, has said in hearings that one of the detectives badgered and yelled at the teenager. The detective also introduced the idea of the knife into the conversation even though the 13-year-old had not mentioned a knife, Ms. Kaplan said.
Beyond the 13-year-old's statements, the police have footage from security cameras of the teenagers leaving the park and one grainy video of the attack, according to the detectives' testimony in two previous hearings. They have yet to locate the murder weapon.
The Legal Aid Society has also sought to undermine the credibility of one of the detectives involved in the investigation, Wilfred Acevedo, pointing out that he has been sued several times over allegations of misconduct, including false arrest, making false accusations and withholding evidence helpful to a defendant.
None of the allegations were proved at trial, but the city settled some of the lawsuits out of court. The lawsuits were reported in Gothamist.
"These allegations of a pattern of serious misconduct cast further doubt on the case against our client, and given Acevedo's long problematic history of violating New Yorkers' constitutional rights, he simply cannot be regarded as credible," the Legal Aid Society said in a statement.
In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Shea responded, saying that Detective Acevedo and other police officials were taking extra steps to safeguard the teenagers' legal rights.
"The calculated, personal attacks against a member of the investigative team working to solve the murder of Tessa Majors is an obvious and unethical effort to make prejudicial statements outside the courtroom to affect a jury pool," Mr. Shea said. He commended Detective Acevedo's 237 arrests -- 93 of those for felony cases -- and 24 department medals.
"Trying to undermine the case by singling out one investigator, and producing dated and unproven allegations and leaking those to the press, rather than in written form to the court, is the opposite of responsible," Mr. Shea added.
As detectives were interviewing the 14-year-old on Thursday, officials at nearby Columbia University sent an email to the school community warning that several faculty and staff members at both Columbia and Barnard had received "viciously racist" robocalls from a white supremacist group. The messages were related to Ms. Majors's death, according to the email, which was sent by three Columbia vice presidents, including the school's head of public safety.
In a separate email to Barnard staff members on Wednesday night, Barnard officials described the calls as a "racist voice mail" left that afternoon. Neither email provided more details about the messages, other than describing them as "abhorrent."
The Police Department was investigating the calls, school officials said. Representatives for Barnard and Columbia declined to comment further.

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Nonprofit changing immigration narrative

Texto completo: Watching the NBC show "Superstore" is like stepping into a Walmart in Middle America.
The show's big-box store called "Cloud 9" is filled with a family of employees tackling the day-to-day grind of a retail job. But the characters in the comedy, whose fifth season premiered in September, are not caricatures – they are an intricate and genuine reflection of this country's diversity.
Amelia "Amy" Sosa, the store manager played by America Ferrera, is a Honduran-American and single mother. Garrett McNeil, a Cloud 9 associate played by actor Colton Dunn, is paralyzed from the waist down.
And Mateo Liwanag, a gay Filipino store associate, is an undocumented immigrant.
The conversation around immigration was intense and highly politicized in 2016 when the writers for "Superstore" decided they wanted a main character to be undocumented.
To get the story right, NBC sought the help of an organization headquartered in Louisville: Define American.
What started as a social movement and storytelling platform asking people to #DefineAmerican, the Louisville-based nonprofit is trying to change the narrative around immigration and citizenship in the United States. It's studied the way words and images in media – from Hollywood portrayals to news articles – affect marginalized communities and the public perception of them.
In addition to "Superstore," Define American has consulted on big-name projects like ABC's "Grey's Anatomy," the longest-running television medical drama in history, and "Roswell, New Mexico," a sci-fi show on the CW.
Thousands of people have used the platform to share their stories, including an undocumented actor who was cast in Marvel's "Black Panther."
Define American, founded in 2012 by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, has also garnered support from high school and college students, politicians and celebrities alike.
At its core, Define American believes that before there can be policy change, there must be cultural change around immigration in the form of storytelling.
That the conversation is being led from Kentucky, the birthplace of iconic cultural figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Muhammad Ali – and the former Confederate States President Jefferson Davis – is no accident.
Louisville is a community with a starkly opposite dichotomy that has coexisted for years, said Ryan Eller, Define American's executive director.
"These juxtapositions that exist in our community are permeating just below the surface, and I can't think of a more perfect place to have this conversation," Eller said. "We think that with Define American, we can finally come together, reckon with the conflict and aspire to something new."
"It's time to start asking, who we are as a people?" Eller added.
And how do we define "American"?
'Can't you just get legal?' In the second season of "Superstore," the 2016 Olympics are in full force and Mateo's co-workers are encouraging him to be more patriotic. While stacking toys in the children's department, Mateo tells a co-worker he just doesn't understand American culture.
"(Americans) are way too into brunch, I wish Asians were allowed to vote and I don't really understand basements," he says, rolling his eyes.
Jonah, a co-worker played by Ben Feldman, interrupts Mateo to ask if he's a U.S. citizen. Mateo is defensive but then hastily makes a phone call and the scene cuts to him realizing that the ID he got from a "green card store" with his grandmother was fake.
Played by Filipino actor Nico Santos, who also appeared in "Crazy Rich Asians," Mateo's "coming out story" was one of the first times a television show on a major network portrayed an honest, nuanced depiction of what it's like to be undocumented in the U.S. – his status was neither a punchline nor a stereotype.
Mateo's fictional story resembles Vargas', who publicly came out as undocumented in a 2011 New York Times Magazine essay. Mateo, like Vargas, is gay and Filipino. And Vargas – like so many – didn't realize he was undocumented until he went to the DMV to apply for a driver's license.
Their parallel is no accident.
When Define American was brought in by NBC to consult for "Superstore," the organization gathered a room full of undocumented people who shared their stories with the production team.
Not understanding the complexity of the legal immigration system in the U.S., the show's writers wanted Mateo to come out as undocumented in one episode, and get citizenship by the next – an impossible task in real life.
It's the same question Vargas still hears every day, even after years of immigration advocacy: "Can't you just get legal?"
It's not that simple.
"All you have to do is talk to an immigrant to find out how complex, nonsensical and contradictory immigration is," Vargas said.
Depending on how someone enters the U.S., what country they originally came from, what immigration status they're seeking and who is able to sponsor or petition their stay, it can take years for someone just to be able to apply for a green card.
And for those who are undocumented, there are almost no pathways to citizenship.
The misunderstanding and culture of indifference are what Vargas has been trying to fix since he wrote that essay eight years ago.
"This is my home," Vargas wrote in the 2011 essay. "Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn't think of me as one of its own."
The night before his article published, Vargas prepared for the worst, afraid he'd be deported.
"What if nobody cares?" Vargas asked a friend. "What if after this big risk, when my lawyers said not to do it, what if I put everything on the line and it lands with a whimper?"
It landed with an uproar – Vargas' story drew international attention.
Soon, he was speaking at events across the country and producing a CNN documentary titled "Documented," which followed his journey.
It was at one of those talks where Eller met Vargas.
A ninth-generation Appalachian, Eller is no stranger to stereotypes. He grew up with images depicting Appalachians as no-shoes-wearing rednecks in shows like "The Beverly Hillbillies," movies like "Dukes of Hazard" and cartoons about the "Hatfield's and McCoy's."
An ordained chaplain with a history of leading nonprofits and pushing for social change in and outside of the church, Eller helped Vargas take Define American from a social movement to a storytelling platform and full-fledged nonprofit organization.
But it's not just a nonprofit. For many, like Vargas, it's a life-changing mission.
"From the beginning of founding Define American, I risked my life for this movement," Vargas said.
Vargas makes it clear he's not working on immigration policy and that his mission with Define American is to start a cultural shift surrounding the perception of immigration.
"I am not a lobbyist," Vargas said. "I'm a storyteller."
Changing the cultural narrative Define American has been at the forefront of helping storytellers in both news and entertainment think deeply about the language they use.
In a 2019 study of major U.S. news outlets, including USA TODAY, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, Define American found that from 2014 to 2018, each of the four publications increasingly published stories with dehumanizing terms such as "illegal" and "alien." It also found the outlets frequently cited sources such as the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank.
Influenced in part by Define American's efforts to change the immigration narrative, The Associated Press announced in 2013 that it would no longer use the term "illegal" to describe people and would abandon the term "illegal immigrant."
But for some, even with a change in "accepted" language surrounding immigration, announcing oneself as undocumented is a huge risk.
At least it was for actor, Bambadjan Bamba, who took a real-life risk when he came out as undocumented three months before his role as a Nigerian militant leader in Marvel's "Black Panther," which went on to make more than $1 billion worldwide at the box office.
Bamba, whose family sought political asylum in the U.S. in 1992 after fleeing Africa's Ivory Coast, used Define American to share his story as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. Enacted under President Barack Obama's administration, DACA provides administrative relief from deportation for eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children. It also helps immigrants get a Social Security card, go to school and receive work permits.
The night before an L.A. Times article detailing his story was published, Bamba couldn't sleep.
"I thought, 'What's going to happen?'" he told The Courier Journal. "What if it's career suicide? What if they cut my scene out of 'Black Panther' and I never work again?"
Bamba remembers talking to his wife about the gut feeling he could no longer ignore. He was inspired by the young people coming forward in the face of President Donald Trump's administration and its decision to rescind DACA.
"I realized I had to do this for my daughter," Bamba said. "I had to remember that I didn't come all this way for nothing, that my parents didn't work so hard for me not to stand up for something."
He used his platform in Hollywood and privilege in having DACA status to advocate for those who don't.
"People were shocked to see that someone who has achieved so much in the entertainment industry is still dealing with these challenges," Bamba said.
Leading the tide of change from Louisville A few days before Define American hosted a summit in early October, where several hundred people from around the U.S. gathered at the Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville, Eller's cellphone was pinging with texts from the organization's chapter leaders.
There were tears in his eyes when one of the leaders of a Define American college chapter, a medical student at Stanford, texted with the news that his father was dying. The student had to choose between coming to the Louisville conference or traveling to his father's deathbed. As a DACA recipient, he could go to the funeral in Mexico, but he could not reenter the U.S.
"He, like so many, risked a great deal to come to Louisville for the summit," Eller said.
It's why Vargas and Eller have known how important it is that Define American's efforts are grounded in Kentucky – because immigration is not just a coastal issue.
According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants make up 3% of Kentucky's population – more than 150,000 people.
"We're here in Middle America, fly-over country, where a lot of people feel ignored," Eller said. "So when we tell people we're headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, it carries a lot of weight ... because they realize we are doing something different."
For Sanchez and many others, it's about having a safe place where people can come together and share their stories and to introduce the immigration narrative to people who have never experienced it before.
"It's about trying to get people from sympathy to empathy to compassion," said Sanchez. "From looking through the window at someone in the rain, to standing next to them in the rain, to holding the umbrella over them."

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.
Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.
Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.
Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."
Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.
Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

World News: U.S. Weighs Cut to West Africa Forces

Texto completo: The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense, the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
During the fall, Mr. Esper requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper has since approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.
However, the U.S. has repeatedly confronted pressing needs in the Middle East, and has had difficulty following through on the strategy of refocusing security resources, officials have said.
The U.S. military first withdrew forces as part of its realignment last year when it removed roughly 700 troops, largely from West Africa.
U.S. troops in Western Africa conduct a range of counterterrorism operations against militant groups, including Boko Haram. But some policy makers question whether such groups pose a threat to the U.S. itself, which has been the criteria used for justifying such deployments in the past.
The U.S. began increasing its forces as part of a global contingent led by France following extremist gains in 2012.
The defense officials said there is no timeline for specific decisions or determinations of troop levels. Any final decision is likely to further shrink the U.S. footprint, although the Pentagon instead could decide to consolidate forces in Western Africa, the officials said.
Major changes to the number of U.S. forces in other parts of Africa are unlikely, they said. The New York Times reported on a possible shift in troops in Western Africa.
Significantly reducing U.S. troops on the continent likely would draw the ire of allies, particularly France, which still has thousands of troops deployed. Critics of the U.S. force posture have noted that both Russian and Chinese influence has expanded throughout Africa as both of those nations have funded weapons purchases, built installations or invested in local infrastructure.
The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
This month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,the officials said.

Trump endorses Collins for reelection

Texto completo: In a tweet Monday, President Donald Trump wrote he agrees 100% that Collins is needed to ensure Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate next year.
When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine refused to vote for him.
Denouncing him for mocking the vulnerable and attacking “ethnic and religious minorities,” she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan instead, a choice that did not even register in the final results since the Wisconsin Republicans had not registered as any sort of candidate in Maine.
But it appears Trump, unusually for him, is not holding a grudge.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham issued a tweet recently hailing Collins, a four-term Republican, for showing “unbelievable courage” during the bitter confirmation fight last year surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “and at other times when our country has needed a steady voice.”
“We need her to ensure a GOP majority in 2020,” Graham wrote, and urged his supporters to send money to Collins’ campaign.
Graham also linked to her recent reelection announcement.
On Monday evening, Trump retweeted Graham’s words and added a few of his own.
“I agree 100%!” Trump wrote.
It marks one of the few times Trump has directly praised Collins, who has proven a presidential ally on some key issues and a thorn in his side on others, especially in her 2017 vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The day after her speech in favor of Kavanaugh in September 2018, Trump told reporters, “I thought that Susan was incredible yesterday.”
Collins has avoided saying anything about whether she will endorse Trump in 2020, focusing instead on what she perceives as the need to work with him on matters of national importance.
While she has not taken a stand on the presidential race next year — which is bound to have a major impact on her effort to win a fifth term — she also has not retracted any of the harsh comments she issued about Trump in a 2016 column in The Washington Post.
Collins has expressed distaste for Trump’s tweets on a number of occasions, occasionally denouncing some as over the line and sometimes simply wishing he would stop using the social media platform.
It is not clear whether Trump has ever referred to Collins so directly before on Twitter.
In 2018, he blasted a bipartisan immigration bill she cosponsored, claiming it would be “a total catastrophe” for the nation.
Generally, though, he has avoided mentioning her.
Trump has retweeted or touted U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, dozens of times. The president has also assailed Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist, more often than he has ever referred to Maine’s senior senator.
One of the Democrats hoping to unseat Collins in Maine’s election next year, Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that Trump and Graham want Collins to return to the Senate in 2021 “because they know she’ll take the side of Republican special interests, not the people of Maine.”

We need - and generally get - competence from bureaucrats

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.
Former Congressman Lee H. Hamilton is a senior adviser for the Indiana University Center on Representative Government.

Allee Willis, songwriter famous for ‘September,’ ‘Friends’ theme, dies at 72

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — Allee Willis, who wrote the iconic theme song to the TV show “Friends” and co-wrote the Earth, Wind & Fire classics “September” and “Boogie Wonderland,” died on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles at the age of 72, it was announced Wednesday.
Willis also co-wrote the Broadway musical “The Color Purple” and the Pointer Sisters’ “Neutron Dance” — among hundreds of other songs — and won a Grammy for 1985’s “Beverly Hills Cop” soundtrack.
She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.
Willis’ death was reported Tuesday night by Variety, which said she suffered cardiac arrest just after 6 p.m. By Christmas Day, her social media accounts were flooded with a mix of shock and warm tributes.
Willis was born in Detroit, and moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s when her career was starting to heat up. In addition to her prodigiously successful songwriting exploits, she also directed music videos for Blondie and the Cars.
She became known around Los Angeles for her lavish home near North Hollywood, an architectural gem designed by William Kesling in 1937, which Willis bought in 1981 and filled with pop culture artifacts and artwork. The home was nicknamed “Willis Wonderland.”
“Her famously wild parties are carefully planned, too,” read a 2011 profile of Willis in The New York Times. “Parties are in the air here, she explained, since the house was built as a retreat for Paramount, a place where actors could let loose on the weekends, in a remote area that was once mostly orange groves and walnut orchards, except for one neighbor down the dirt road, Amelia Earhart.”
According to the SHOF website, which posted an obituary of Willis on Wednesday, she began curating The Allee Willis Museum of Kitsch website in 2009.
“Her work in art direction, set design and animation was recognized in 2008 by both the Webby Awards and the W3 Awards for her Allee Willis Presents Bubbles & Cheesecake music video collaboration with singer-songwriter Holly Palmer. A cyber pioneer, she designed lilytomlin.com as an online tour of LilyTomlin’s life, and has consulted and created content for numerous entertainment and technology companies,” the SHOF said.
Willis is survived by a brother, Kent Willis, and sister, Marlin Frost; and niece, Mandy Becker, according to the SHOF.
“I’m someone that absolutely loves writing very joyful music,” she said in a 2008 Songfacts interview. “And with everything else I’ve ever written, (“September” is] still that song that when people found out I’d written that, they just go, ‘Oh my God,’ and then tell me in some form how happy that song makes them every time they hear it.”

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Texto completo: The New York Times, the Democrats, and some others would have you believe that this impeachment is making history. It isn't.
Even a huge, screaming headline in the biggest type possible cannot lend suspense or importance to an event that began three years ago and whose outcome was never in doubt. The war to impeach President Trump has been waged at full throttle since 2016. And so, an inflection point in late 2019 is not all that striking, especially since the next stage in the drama will be to return the whole thing to the status quo ante.
The impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had been genuine digressions from the traditional politics that had marked their first terms in office, and to which the country would later return. In contrast, our politics has been dialed up to 13 on a 1-to-10 scale since Trump was elected.
No, Jennifer Rubin, "Impeachment Day" will not soon rival Independence Day or Memorial Day in the nation’s affections. This will not be remembered like Saint Crispin's Day. The articles of impeachment will not be read aloud in the public squares of the nation, as children stand awestruck and grown people weep. As with the Clinton impeachment in the late 1990s, people who thought the president had done some good things understand that his moral sense is, in some sense, deficient. Now, as then, they have made their peace with it. Save for the partisans on both sides of the spectrum; they are not deeply invested now, just as they were not then.
People knew Clinton had committed a crime, but the crime in itself hadn’t involved his professional duties. Trump’s talk about people and things could be truly abhorrent, but it’s sticks and stones that break bones, not petulant nicknames, insults, and chatter that fail to rise to a criminal level. Nineteen years ago, people calmly accepted another partisan impeachment in the House. They have accepted this one, too, and they will accept the equally partisan acquittal in the Senate that is sure to follow. Both are predictable exercises in party-line voting, and everyone recognizes this except for the blindest partisans who are caught up in the moment.
The New York Times, the Democrats, and Jennifer Rubin want you to think this is Agincourt, and impeachment is history being made before our eyes. But Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Jerry Nadler of New York are not the Plantagenets; they are not an outnumbered army (except in the Senate), and they are not facing the fight of their lives for themselves and their country. Rather, they are partisan functionaries involved in a predictable effort to fulfill the demands of Democratic primary voters and small-dollar online donors.
What's more, as they did the work of holding hearings and entertaining journalists, the public's opinion of their impeachment actually declined in the polls. "History’s going to forget this," Peggy Noonan said on Meet the Press Sunday. She’s right.

The Lincoln Project takes on Trump — and possibly Maine's Susan Collins

Texto completo: Several veterans of past Republican campaigns, including the former head of New Hampshire's GOP, have created a committee aimed at defeating President Trump in 2020 and congressional Republicans who have supported him.
Dubbed the Lincoln Project, the group has Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine as one of its biggest potential targets. Collins already faces a Democratic challenger and growing scrutiny from all corners as the Senate prepares for an expected Trump impeachment trial.
“It is my great hope, as this impeachment process unfolds, that she will have the courage to do what is right, to stand up and put the country over party, to be a voice for the people over Donald Trump," said Jennifer Horn, a former head of New Hampshire's Republican Party and a cofounder of the Lincoln Project.
“If that doesn't happen," Horn said, “then, yes, unfortunately, Senator Collins becomes part of this," a Lincoln Project target.
The project is one of several small, but vocal, rebellions against Trump, who has taken over the national Republican Party apparatus and rarely experiences pushback from its members in Congress.
Collins, who has walked a tightrope through roiling partisan politics, has said little about how she intends to vote in the Senate's expected impeachment trial of Trump. Long known as an independent thinker, Collins infuriated members of her party when she helped kill the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But she faced criticism from Democrats when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Collins, in a statement, offered few clues about how she might vote in an impeachment trial. “I intend to make my decision on whether or not to convict President Trump on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial," she said. “Threats from both the left and the right will have zero influence on that decision."
Trump has remained steadily popular among Republicans across the country, despite his overall low approval ratings and his impeachment last week by the House, all of which makes the Lincoln Project's effort an uphill battle.
When the House voted to impeach Trump for trying to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — a potential Trump challenger in 2020 — not a single Republican joined the Democratic majority. In some states, the GOP has maneuvered to keep Trump's primary challengers off the 2020 ballot altogether.
Nonetheless, the Lincoln Project, unveiled in a New York Times op-ed the day before the House impeached Trump, describes the president as a “bogus prophet," whose actions threaten the Constitution and American way of life.
“We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference," said the op-ed authors and Lincoln Project cofounders, who include George T. Conway III, an attorney known as an outspoken Trump critic and husband of presidential adviser Kelleyanne Conway.
“Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort," they wrote.
They envision persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans, and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to vote against Trump and his supporters “even if that means Democratic control of the Senate and an expanded Democratic majority in the House."
Joshua Tardy, a Maine attorney who served as honorary chairman for Collins's last Senate campaign, dismissed the project's goals and chances of success. “There will be a lot of noise makers on both sides and this super PAC will just be another noise maker in a noisy election," Tardy said. (Such political action committees can raise funds from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups without any limit on donation size or expenditure.)
Collins recently announced she will run for reelection. And while she hasn't said whether she will endorse Trump, the president this week indicated his support for her — via Twitter. When Senator Lindsey Graham encouraged voters to support Collins's reelection, Trump responded: “I agree 100%."
Horn, from the Lincoln Project, said her group raised over $500,000 in the two days after it was announced.
The group's day-to-day activities will be overseen by Horn, who twice ran for Congress from New Hampshire, and by Reed Galen, a longtime Republican strategist. Other members include two former strategists for the late Senator John McCain, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver.
Maine is considered a battleground state in 2020. That's partly because its electorate is divided and unpredictable: The state has a Republican senator, an independent senator, and two Democratic members of the House. The current Democratic governor followed a provocative Republican. Maine is also a key electoral state because it is one of just two (the other is Nebraska) that does not use the traditional winner-take-all method of allocating Electoral College votes. Trump won one of the state's four votes in 2016, the first time a Republican took any of Maine's votes in decades.
Tardy is not worried.
“At the end of the day, Donald Trump and Susan Collins enjoy enormous support by their Republican base," he said.
The Lincoln Project is also focusing on candidates in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, and Arizona.
Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, who is challenging Trump for the presidential nomination, said he is focused on beating Trump, but not on targeting other Republicans.
He said, however, that he agreed with the project's mission of defeating Trump.
“I am delighted to see a little hardball on the side of the nice guys," Weld said.
He draws parallels to 1973, when, he said, he was an ambitious young lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee and was advised by others in the Republican Party to steer clear of the impeachment process because of Richard Nixon's popularity, despite the Watergate break-in.
Nixon ultimately resigned in 1974 before the House voted on impeachment, as evidence against him mounted and support from loyal congressional defenders dissolved. Weld believes those who stand by Trump in a Senate trial will suffer politically.
“If the Republicans in the Senate walk the plank silently for Mr. Trump, all of those who are up next year in the 2020 election will lose their seats," he said.
Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman who ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican nomination against Trump last month, had not heard of the Lincoln Project. But Sanford, a fiscal conservative, said he wished the founders well. “I think we need to have a conversation as Republicans as to what it means to be a Republican," Sanford said. “We have lost our way . . . based on a temporary political amnesia that will fade."

Pentagon Considering a Troop Reduction in West Africa; Defense officials seek a first step toward a Trump blueprint focusing on big-power rivalries, but the strategy has proven elusive

Texto completo: The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense , the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
Mr. Esper during the fall requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper since has approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.
However, the U.S. has repeatedly confronted pressing needs in the Middle East, and has had difficulty following through on the strategy of refocusing security resources , officials have said.
The U.S. military first withdrew forces as part of its realignment last year when it removed roughly 700 troops, largely from West Africa.
U.S. troops in Western Africa conduct a range of counterterrorism operations against militant groups , including Boko Haram, but some policy makers question whether such groups pose a threat to the U.S. itself, which has been the criteria used for justifying such deployments in the past.
The U.S. began increasing its forces as part of a global contingent led by France following extremist gains in 2012.
The defense officials said there is no timeline for specific decisions or determinations of troop levels. Any final decision is likely to further shrink the U.S. footprint, although the Pentagon instead could decide to consolidate forces in Western Africa, the officials said.
Major changes to the number of U.S. forces in other parts of Africa are unlikely, they said. The New York Times first reported on possible shift in troops in Western Africa.
Significantly reducing U.S. troops on the continent likely would draw the ire of allies, particularly France, which still has thousands of troops deployed. Critics of the U.S. force posture have noted that both Russian and Chinese influence has expanded throughout Africa as both of those nations have funded weapons purchases, built installations or invested in local infrastructure.
The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
Earlier this month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the officials said.

Texto completo: End this brutal division
America is in a very interesting state, politically. Mainly for the citizens' brutal dividing amongst themselves. Left vs. right, donkey vs. elephant, liberal vs. conservative — whatever or wherever someone has decided to be on the political scale, a majority of the time they will stick to it.
Check out the NBC News article, “Americans are divided over everything except division” comparing how divided people are politically and who blames who. Also, considering how easy it is to surround yourself with the information you want, it becomes so apparent to just see what you believe.
But I want to explore the thought of expanding one's personal understanding and seeing the other side. The article by NBC News at the end mentions that people blame the other side generally for this division. What if you as a person accept that everyone is to blame for this division? And as a whole, we better each other by giving other's ideas a chance to at least find common ground, and end this brutal division amongst us, the people of America.

Reading, writing still essential
Recently, I talked with a friend who works as an assistant teacher in the Vancouver school system. She said in a classroom she worked in, that cursive handwriting is no longer being taught. One child's writing was totally illegible. The teacher told my friend “he has his own way of writing.”
Reading online about this, a New York Times article quoted a teacher calling grammar “soul crushing,” and that writing should be “psychologically liberating” (“Why Kids Can't Write,” The New York Times, Aug. 2, 2017).
How common is this? Will our next generation be “psychologically liberated” (whatever that is), but unable to read or write or barely able to communicate in words on a job — only able to push buttons on electronics?
I'm a taxpayer, and feel I am not getting a good value for my education tax dollars.

Place service above self
While a member of Rotary International, I became enamored of their motto: “Service above self.” How different our own country would be if everyone, from the president on down, would practice that simple truth. Serving others is truly more vital than meeting our own needs.
Think about how much misery is caused by self-centeredness. Someone much wiser than I said that there's more than enough for everyone's need; but not nearly enough for even one person's greed. For our lives to be truly memorable and to leave a meaningful legacy, life needs to be less about me, more about us. Or to use a Confucius-like proverb, “Person wrapped in self make very small package.”
“Service above self” offers each of us and all of us a more perfect way, not only to live, but perhaps for civilization to survive.

Her body, her right
Women fought 100 years to gain their rights. It wasn't until March of 1972 that the Equal Rights Amendment was passed by Congress; since then, 37 states ratified the Amendment.
Yet even after gaining their rights, women don't have the right to make their own choices. Six states have passed trigger laws that try to ban abortion in the first and second trimesters. Alabama wanted to pass a law banning abortion at any state of pregnancy with no exceptions for pregnancy resulting in rape and incest. A baby born as the result of close incest has a 50 percent chance of suffering an early death, severe birth defects or some mental deficiency.
The states should not be able to decide for a woman; it is her body and her right.

Texto completo: Lower levies on food, drug ingredients and hundreds of other items will help China keep trading with other nations while many tariffs on American products remain.
BEIJING -- China said on Monday that it will lower tariffs on a variety of goods imported from around the world starting on Jan. 1, moving to support domestic consumers even as a trade truce with the United States has relieved some of the pressure on the Chinese economy.
The action, less than two weeks after Beijing and the Trump administration reached a partial deal to end their trade war, also helps China buttress its assertions that it has continued to open up its market despite the long-running conflict with the United States.
The stopgap trade pact reached this month forestalled one last round of American tariffs that would have extended levies to cover nearly every shoe, laptop and toy that the United States imports from China.
But the deal still leaves many question marks over China's economy, which has slowed as the tariff conflict has dragged on. With many tariffs on American products still in place, China needs to keep trading with other nations to satisfy its people's demands for imported goods.
The list of 859 products that will face lower import levies appears to have been carefully chosen to meet various requirements of the moment.
Among the goods are frozen pork, which the country needs because its pig herds have been devastated by a deadly epidemic of swine fever. The list also includes pharmaceutical ingredients, which China requires as its population ages and demand for new drugs grows, as well as high-tech components, a necessity as China pushes to become a world leader in industries such as computer chips.
Levies will also be lowered on grocery items such as avocados, orange juice and seafood, as Chinese households become choosier about the food they eat.
As frictions with the United States began heating up in 2018, China stepped up efforts to lower trade barriers with the rest of the world. It announced a similar tariff cut a year ago. That one covered 706 products.

Emanuel Ungaro, 86, Fashion Designer Who Hated 'Boring Clothes'

Texto completo: Mr., Ungaro's clothes could be both chic and surprising. Fashion, he believed, should be "disturbing to the eye."
Emanuel Ungaro, whose merging of attention-getting colors and patterns with sleek lines made him one of the most talked-about fashion designers in Paris beginning in the 1960s and served as the foundation for the fashion house that still bears his name, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 86.
The Emanuel Ungaro fashion house, which Mr. Ungaro sold in 2005, announced his death on its Facebook page. No cause was given.
Mr. Ungaro, who came from a family of tailors, established his fashion house in 1965 after working under the designer Cristóbal Balenciaga.
The celebrity journalist James Brady, in a "Brady's Bits" column in 1987, wrote that Mr. Ungaro, whom he had known since the 1960s, financed his first show with a loan that used a girlfriend's Porsche as collateral. The event, Mr. Brady wrote, was held in a small apartment. People sat on the balcony and peered in through windows to see the clothes.
Within a few years Mr. Ungaro's creations were being worn by A-listers like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and being seen in films on Catherine Deneuve (in "Le Sauvage," 1975), Gena Rowlands ("Gloria," 1980) and other actresses.
His ever-changing signatures over the years included stand-up collars, abundant use of suede, wrap dresses, mixed prints and more. He might pair a paisley blouse with a plaid suit, or prescribe a colorful shawl for a distinctive look, or go all in on polka dots.
"I hate boring clothes," he told The Washington Post in 1977. "I hate seeing women dressed in a sad way."
Mr. Ungaro explained his approach to design in 1994, when he opened a boutique in Manhattan.
"If you want to exist in fashion, and in any other manifestation of art, you have to disturb people," he told The New York Times. "Provocation, in my mouth, means disturbing to the eye. Not disturb just to disturb, but disturb by showing something unexpected."
Emanuel Ungaro was born on Feb. 13, 1933, in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. His father, Cosimo, was a tailor who had fled Fascist Italy.
"My father is like a god to me," Mr. Ungaro told The Boston Globe in 1965. "He taught me to respect line and quality, and to take pains with every stitch."
After working for three years in his father's tailoring business, determined to make a career in fashion but needing a bigger stage on which to do it, he left his hometown for Paris when he was 21.
"I arrived in Paris with two pairs of pants, three shirts and not one cent in my pocket," he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1992.
He spent two years as a stylist for Maison Camps tailors, then in 1958 took a job with Balenciaga's fashion house. He spent six years there, absorbing Balenciaga's ideas on line and color and how to drape the body.
Beginning in 1964 he spent about a year working with André Courrèges, who shook up the fashion scene in Paris that year with his mod "Space Age" collection. The next year, Mr. Ungaro established his own company, and The Times took note of one of his first showings.
"Emanuel Ungaro was a youth movement unto himself as he carried the Courrèges spirit one step farther," the newspaper wrote.
His early work often drew mixed reviews, but by 1972 his collection was being hailed as the best of the bunch in Paris.
"He likes geometric patterns in multitudinous colors," Bernadine Morris wrote in The Times that July. "He used to mix them up so much that you didn't know where to look, but this time he has put everything together properly."
The 1970s and '80s were his best decades. In 1980, the Associated Press fashion writer Suzy Patterson called his summer show "one of his best couture collections ever -- and certainly the most exciting seen so far this week."
"As usual," she continued, "Ungaro had a field day mixing fabrics with a whole rainbow of silks in the same outfit. In a favorite type of skirt, stripes or plaids and paisley appear on the same piece of fabric, and everything shimmers with Jacquard weave."
By the mid-1990s his company was struggling, and in 1996 he sold a majority stake to Salvatore Ferragamo Italia, the Italian company best known for shoes; the agreement kept the Ungaro company independent, with Mr. Ungaro as president. In 2005, he sold his stake to Asim Abdullah, a venture capitalist, and retired.
Mr. Ungaro's survivors include his wife, Laura Bernabei, whom he married in 1989, and a daughter, Cosima Ungaro.
"There are no rules in this business," Mr. Ungaro told The Chronicle after a show that, a quarter-century into the life of his fashion house, still included surprising mixtures, like an aqua jacket with a taupe pleated skirt and mauve satin blouse. "The only rule you should have is to respect yourself and respect others' dignity."

The 12 podcasts of 2019 you need to listen to

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

TWO MOON PARTIES BOTH PARTIES HAVE WEAKENED THEMSELVES

Texto completo: Here's a theory for why our politics are so confusing these days: Neither party wants to be a majority party.
From an ideological perspective, majority parties are, by nature, weird. For instance, the long-dominant FDR coalition included a strange mix of blacks and segregationists, corrupt city machines and the reformers who hated them.
Over the several decades that followed, most major policy questions were hashed out within the Democratic Party. The Republicans factored in mostly as stalemate-breakers. So, for instance, the great intra-Democratic Party fight between liberals and Southern segregationists was only settled when Republicans sided with the civil rights bloc. Eighty percent of Republicans voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, while fewer than 70% of Democrats did.
Samuel Lubell, a Polish-born political analyst, famously described this dynamic as the "sun and moon" system of political parties. In our "political solar system," Lubell wrote in 1951, "it is within the majority party that the issues of any particular period are fought out; while the minority party shines in reflected radiance of the heat thus generated."
The Democratic sun started its long arc of descent in 1968. In 1972, Richard Nixon managed to pick off sizable support from the white working class for a massive landslide re-election victory. Ronald Reagan's victories and the subsequent GOP capture of the House in 1994 - after a 40-year Democratic reign - seemed to seal the deal.
But then, as New York Times columnist David Brooks noted in 2011, "something strange happened. No party took the lead." The outcome, he wrote, is "both parties have become minority parties simultaneously. We are living in the era of two moons and no sun."
Nearly a decade later, things are even more bizarre. We may be more partisan than ever, but the partisans tend to dislike their own parties - they just hate the other party more.
There are many reasons for this polarization, but one of them is that the most committed members of each party have a decidedly lunar mindset. Progressives and conservatives alike are convinced they are victims of the Powers That Be. Each side defines the Powers That Be differently, though there is some overlap when it comes to animosity toward economic "elites." Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment, and even though she won the Democratic nomination, nearly all the passion in the party flows to some version of Bernie Sanders' or Elizabeth Warren's radical indictment of the system.
As political consultant Luke Thompson notes, minority parties tend to obsess about unity because without it they are even more powerless. This makes ideological purity a vital source of cohesion. Majority parties have both the luxury and the burden of power. To govern is to make policy choices, and choosing A over B will always disappoint the backers of B.
The problem is that the ideological purity dominating both sides is a kind of righteous victimhood. The result is a Democratic Party suffused with a sense that it should be a majority party but is being denied its rightful status, making denunciations of "white supremacy" and the "oligarchy" simultaneously more intense and comforting. Voter suppression is a legitimate issue, but it is not the unified field theory for Democratic failures some want it to be - nor can voter fraud be blamed for Republican failures.
Meanwhile, the GOP could be a majority party, but the perceived need to be a Trump party prevents it from even trying. Not only are Mr. Trump's politics fueled by culture war resentment and victimology, but his bottomless need for adulation is simply an inadequate rationale for a sun party to hold a majority together.
Both parties are weakened by decades of misguided reforms and the growth of a media industrial complex invested in telling its customers what they want to hear, making it impossible for either moon to achieve the escape velocity required to become a sun party.
As political scientists Steven Teles and Robert Saldin argue, the best way out is for new moderate political factions to organize and demand concessions for their support. But that will require a lot of work, made all the more difficult by the burden of toiling in moonlight.

Democrats Are Cautious About Ideas On Far Left

Texto completo: A new survey finds that Democrats haven't fully embraced progressive policy proposals like free college and Medicare for all.
Progressive policy ideas have dominated the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign. But as candidates gather in Los Angeles for another debate on Thursday evening, Democratic voters may be seeking more moderate options.
Only one in four Democratic voters says they would favor eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a government-run plan -- the centerpiece of the "Medicare for all" proposals put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And only one in three favors making public college tuition free for all Americans regardless of income, another idea shared by the two leading progressives in the race.
Those results, from a survey conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, are striking because past polls, including those from The Times, have shown broad-based support for progressive ideas among Democrats. Last month, 81 percent of Democrats said they approved of Medicare for all; in July, 82 percent said they supported making public colleges free for all.
But those earlier surveys asked simple yes-or-no questions. The most recent survey offered respondents more options to choose from. And it found that Democratic voters consistently preferred policies that were well to the left of current law, but were more moderate than those proposed by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
Most Democrats, for example -- 58 percent -- said they would like to make government-run insurance universally available, while allowing people to keep their private insurance if they prefer it, a policy similar to the "Medicare for all who want it" plan proposed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and a related proposal from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A further 15 percent said the United States should reform the health care system without adopting a government-run plan at all, or that the current system was working well. Only 25 percent said they would prefer a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance.
The preference for more moderate policies cuts across age groups, races, education levels and even ideology: Among Democrats who said they were "liberal" or "very liberal," only 30 percent chose the most progressive option for health care reform.
Naomi Korchonnoff, a graduate student in Tacoma, Wash., supports Mr. Sanders, who she said would tackle systemic problems that other candidates are afraid to address. But she stopped short of supporting Mr. Sanders's plan to get rid of private insurance.
"I don't agree with the blanket aspect of it because I think that people who earn enough to have their own private insurance, say through their employer, should be able to keep that," she said. "It's ideal insurance to have."
Ms. Korchonnoff, 31, said the lawmakers should make health care available to all, especially low- and moderate-income people who do not qualify for existing government programs but struggle to afford insurance through the subsidized marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
"Making it available to people who cannot afford to buy marketplace insurance is very important," she said.
The Times survey showed similar results when it came to "free college" proposals. About a third of Democrats said that the government should make public colleges free to low- and moderate-income families, but that the wealthy should still have to pay -- again a policy close to that proposed by Mr. Buttigieg. Another third said that college should be more affordable but that most families should have to pay something. The remaining third expressed the most liberal position, that college should be free for all.
Voters also sounded a note of caution about the cost of candidates' plans: Half of Democrats said the United States should adopt progressive proposals only if they do not increase the budget deficit, compared to 38 percent who said they supported the plans regardless of their fiscal impact. Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren say they will pay for their plans through higher taxes, not through borrowing more money.
In interviews, voters gave different reasons for their positions. Some said they thought the most liberal positions went too far or questioned whether they would work in practice. Others were more focused on political strategy, concerned that liberal positions would hurt Democrats in the general election next fall.
"I have a preferred idealistic position, which is Medicare for all," said Carla Silvey, a tech worker in the San Francisco area. "I don't know how feasible that is."
Ms. Silvey, 50, said she believed a government-run health care system was a near inevitability in the long run because the current system is too broken to last. But she is torn about whether Democrats should embrace that solution now.
"I don't know whether to go bold or to try to be in the middle," she said.
Many Democrats appear to be making similar calculations. Ms. Warren, who surged into the top tier of the Democratic field over the summer, has fallen in the polls in recent weeks, while Mr. Buttigieg has gained ground. (Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have retained relatively steady support.)
Still, the Times survey doesn't necessarily imply voters will abandon progressive candidates. Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey, noted that many voters said they trusted Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren on health care despite favoring more moderate positions than those candidates.
"Are you voting for the policy, or voting for the person?" Ms. Wronski said.
John Soderholm, a middle school guidance counselor near Minneapolis, doesn't want to give up his private insurance, and worries that the Democratic Party will alienate voters if it embraces too liberal a message. But he said Democrats also run a risk if they are too meek: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have generated enthusiasm in part by being willing to take bold positions, even if not all their supporters believe their plans will come to fruition.
"Who gets excited about incrementalism?" Mr. Soderholm asked rhetorically. "You've got to have some sizzle too."

About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 4,093 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Dec. 2 to Dec. 8. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus two percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"Giving Injured Troops Their Day in Court" (news article, Dec. 12) is optimistic that Congress's proposed administrative process for medical malpractice claims against the Defense Department will help open courthouse doors shut to service members. I'm worried that this legislation will have the opposite effect.
Because of the "Feres doctrine," service members cannot file tort suits against the Defense Department. This year, Sgt. First Class Richard Stayskal, who has terminal cancer, bravely fought to overturn Feres in medical malpractice cases. The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act, however, leaves Feres untouched. Instead, it creates an administrative compensation regime.
I'm glad that injured service members will get monetary relief. But I'm concerned that this will placate us. The press is celebrating and Congress is patting itself on the back. Also, the Defense Department can use this remedy to protect Feres. It can now say that there's an avenue for justice.
Service members still deserve their day in court. Under Congress's administrative process, the Defense Department sits as judge and defendant. Where's the neutrality?

Rose Parade grand marshals have the power to inspire

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Democrats may save us yet

Texto completo: Wednesday's impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We've known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know, as surely as we can know anything in politics, that a Republican-controlled Senate won't convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that's not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of my fellow citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day - a day of both despair and hope.
The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference - that true American exceptionalism - will be enough to save us.
Let's back up and ask what we've learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they were doing so, the object of their adoration was giving an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they've become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. And like similar parties in other countries, the GOP is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump's supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don't.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary's Fidesz and Poland's Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition - disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I'd like to dismiss such concerns, but I can't.
Add in the extent to which next year's election will be rigged in Trump's favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College - and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population - and it's all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won't give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else's. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Ann Patchett's seventh novel, "The Dutch House," is a tale that lingers long after the final page.
A story of home, love, disappointment and forgiveness, the novel centers around the family home of siblings and parents through decades of their changes, longings and, eventually, a comfortable sense of healing that bridges to the next generation.
A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and the Iowa Writer's Workshop, Patchett has won numerous awards and fellowships, including England's Orange Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. She has authored six previous novels, three books of nonfiction, and a children's book.
In November 2011, she became co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she lives with her husband, Karl VanDevender, and their dog, Sparky.
Reviews for "The Dutch House" often refer to it as "a dark fairy tale," and, indeed, its main characters – two siblings whose childhoods were darkened by the abandonment of their mother, followed by the presence of a cruel stepmother, and their attachment to a large and looming home – spend their lives lamenting their misfortunes in later years, but are still drawn back to the house. Tell us briefly about their childhood regrets.
Danny and Maeve regret that they didn't get the house. They regret that their stepmother won, and they lost. Funny, but when I think about regrets, I tend to think about my own actions and not the actions of others. I think they see themselves as fairly blameless in how the events of their childhood unfolded, and I think they're right. I don't want to give too much away but when Danny is a teenager, he feels he dealt with a terrible situation terribly, but I believe that as an adult he doesn't blame himself or harbor any regret.
The house that siblings Maeve and her younger brother Danny grew up in – and would be banished from – is practically a character itself. The design and features of this unique structure, not to mention its furnishings – loom as large as its physical presence. In what ways does this house stand as a metaphor of this story?
I think of houses as our public face. Our house is how other people see us. Houses represent our success and our failure, our good times and bad. It's where we store our memories. If you've ever had the experience of driving past a house you used to live in, you remember very quickly how you felt when you were there. So, for Danny and Maeve the house represents a happier time when their mother was still with them, and it also represents the security of wealth. They had never imagined another kind of life for themselves, and while Maeve was already out of the house, and in a very small apartment, Danny had no idea about the turns that life might take. Children rarely do.
The story goes far beyond the siblings' childhood years, continuing through their middle age and beyond – as it unfolds their divergent careers and personal lives, and, near the end, the unexpected appearance of a character. When you're developing a story, do you map out the way their lives evolve for such a long time?
I do. Different writers approach this question differently. I really have to know where I'm going, or I just meander around and get nowhere. I like structure and plot, so I work out the larger details of the novel before I start writing. It's my favorite part of the process, thinking a story up. I don't write things down. I keep everything in my head. That way I don't get too attached to a certain idea. I can change my mind. I can just forget about something. My outlines aren't specific, but I have a clear idea about all the characters, who they are, what they want, as well as their arrivals and departures.
It seems that the Dutch House redeems itself at the end. What does that state for the entire story?
I've been told this is a very sad book and I've been told it has a happy ending. I like the fact that different people can read it in different ways. The house never changes. It is, after all, just a house. It's incapable of feelings, a fact that irritates Danny and Maeve who believe on some level that the house should have collapsed in solidarity when they were thrown out. Again, I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say the house is loved and obsessed over for many generations.
Ultimately, this story doesn't seem to be the expected "good guy, bad guy" tale; rather, it's pretty much everyone doing the best he or she can. Could you comment on that?
I'm awful at writing villains. I definitely lean towards sympathetic characters, mainly because most all of the people I know personally are sympathetic. We seem to be living in a world of good and evil now, and who is good and who is evil depends on who you're listening to. But I think most people do the best they can. That said, Andrea is the closest thing I've ever come to a villain, and I can even see how she was young and in over her head. I keep meaning to try harder with my villains, but I spend so much time with my characters and look at them so closely I can't help but feel some empathy for most of them.

Texto completo: storrs - Chris Dailey was first charged with coaching the UConn women's basketball team in late February 1989, when Geno Auriemma was suspended over a scheduling snafu for the regular season finale at St. John's and the Big East Tournament to follow.
Dailey was stressed out.
"I think the only thing I ate in four days was a piece of cake for Kerry Bascom's birthday," she said.
Thirty years later, filling in isn't such a daunting task. And it's hard to imagine Dailey, the program's disciplinarian and protector, stressed out over much of anything in a basketball world UConn has dominated.
"I'm hoping to be bad for basketball," said Dailey, who will coach the Huskies in Auriemma's absence Sunday against Oklahoma. "Some people like the underdog role and all of that. I'd prefer to have the best team and I'd prefer to have people expect us to do well because we expect ourselves to do well."
Remember when UConn was taking heat last year for failing to land a couple marquee recruits?
Dailey, the program's recruiting coordinator, heard all the noise that was ultimately nonsense.
Paige Bueckers, the top recruit in the Class of 2020 and perhaps the most intriguing UConn prospect since Diana Taurasi, was already waiting in the wings. Amari DeBerry (2021) and Isuneh Brady (2022) and several others soon climbed aboard, setting up the Huskies to have one stellar class after another well into the future.
"I laugh at the people that make the comments about where our recruiting is," Dailey said. "They don't know anything about what we do or how we do it. I don't think those same people are making comments now. We don't worry about it, but it does make you chuckle a little bit."
Auriemma continues to recover from surgery to alleviate symptoms caused by diverticulitis.
Seeing Dailey out in front of the operation should remind us what she has meant behind the scenes for all 1,071 victories, all 11 national championships and everything else in a remarkable 35-year run kickstarted by what took place down the stretch of that pre-Gampel Pavilion 1988-89 season.
The Huskies were Big East regular-season champions for the first time in history and soon, under Dailey, conference tournament champions for the first time. With Auriemma back on the bench, UConn also won an NCAA Tournament game for the first time that year. Two years later, the Huskies were in the Final Four, national champions by 1995.
All these years later the blue and white basketball bus keeps rolling like no other operation in college sports, with Dailey behind Auriemma as the meticulous caretaker. No one has more face-to-face time with players during their four years in Storrs.
"I think I just read a headline in the New York Times that said, 'UConn Who?' " Dailey said, citing a story about the recent success of Pac-12 teams. "That made me chuckle, too."
Dailey gets to steer by herself Sunday. She is 9-0 all-time, also coaching three games in 1997 while Auriemma mourned the death of his father and two more last season while he was ill. All the games she has coached have been in February or March.
"This one is a little more difficult because it's earlier in the season," she said. "We have a lot to work on and we have a lot to do to get better. I want us to play better. I want us to get better. Against DePaul [Monday night] we probably played 28 really, really good minutes - between 28 and 30. Our goal this game is we need to cut down the minutes we don't play as well as we want to."
Who runs a more difficult practice? Auriemma or Dailey?
"Don't put this anywhere," Crystal Dangerfield said, smiling. "CD."
"Coach does drills but he goes however long he wants to go," Christyn Williams said. "CD is very, like, on a schedule - get in and get out - which is good, but she's a stickler for details. So is Coach, but she's really a stickler. So it's harder."
That's Dailey - meticulous, detailed, regimented.
She's the constant conversationalist following up with players after Auriemma's broad messages and lessons. She has unique skills in being able to push players, understand them, entertain them. She doesn't screw around - until it's actually time to screw around, so she's the one laying out and enforcing the program's strictest rules and also planning the Easter egg hunts and city tours during road trips.
Her philosophy has always been to set a difficult standard and ease up over time, giving players more of a voice as they begin to understand the program's culture.
"When I first got here, of course I had my tattoo that visible," said Williams, who like every other player in the program history covers that tattoo during games. "So she was talking about that. And I had a nose piercing. I had to take that out. I'm like, OK, there are a lot of rules."
Dailey will have to sacrifice some of the personal conversations that take place at her usual seat on the bench in order to run the game.
"Practice is the same whether he's here or not," Dailey said. "There are things we need to get better at and that's what we're going to do. The [game] is a little different because the things that I normally take care of, I still think about them but I'll make sure [other assistants] have it, whether it's subs or minutes played, timeouts.
"The whole pre-game stuff is different. I don't want to change everything. I like to do what I normally do for [players] but doing that changes because I'm on the other side, making the decisions. It's just a little hectic, that's all."
Still, Dailey running the team for a game or two has a business-as-usual feel.
"I tell the players all the time, you have to be ready," Dailey said. "You never know whether someone's going to sprain an ankle, get sick, foul trouble, and they're not going to be ready to go. So as a coach we have to do the same thing. You don't hope and you never expect that someone isn't going to be able to be there, but him not being there, we all have to step up and be ready. And I think we are ready."

Texto completo: Ward Just had only been a Washington Post reporter for a few months in 1965 when he was offered the opportunity to cover the Vietnam War.
“It was as if some voice said to me, 'This is something you'd better do,' " he recalled in a 2004 Globe interview.
The following 18 months as a war correspondent shaped him into the fiction writer he had hoped to become. “I was watching people, for the first time in my life, in extreme situations," he said, “the way people in that environment dealt with one another, while all the time there was this thundering war going on in the jungles."
Leaving newspaper reporting behind a couple of years after returning home in 1967, he wrote a shelf full of novels — fiction that drew more admiration than awards, to the consternation of his fans.
Mr. Just, who had Lewy body dementia, died Thursday in Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Plymouth. He was 84 and had lived on Martha's Vineyard full time since the early 1990s.
“I can't imagine what my life would have been without Vietnam," he told the Globe in 1982. “It's present in the memory, it moves around with me wherever I am."
Vietnam and the swirling politics in Washington, D.C., often figured in his novels and short stories, and in the magazine and newspaper articles he wrote less often after turning to fiction.
“Echo House," which chronicles three generations of political powerbrokers, was set in Washington — a city “that is his uncontested literary turf," John Hough Jr. wrote in a 1997 Globe review of Mr. Just's novel, which was a National Book Award finalist.
“Surely no living novelist knows Washington better, or brings to it such penetrating intelligence," Hough added.
Mr. Just “is not merely America's best political novelist. He is America's greatest living novelist. To our discredit, he's also America's Greatest Unknown Novelist," Susan Zakin wrote for the LitHub website last year.
His writing reached beyond the battlefields and political campaigns he had once covered as a reporter, however.
“He is equally at home in Chicago, Boston, and Washington," Herbert Mitgangwrote in a 1990 New York Times review of Mr. Just's collection “Twenty-One: Selected Stories."
In the story “About Boston," an O Henry Award finalist, a character says of the Hub: “I like collapsing civilizations. I'm a connoisseur of collapse and systems breakdown and bankruptcy — moral, ethical and financial. So Boston is perfect."
Still, Mr. Just's precise observations had a particular resonance when his subject was a battlefield where he witnessed combatants at close range.
One day in 1966, in a Vietnam rice field, Mr. Just had “settled under a palm tree to make endless notes — a reporter's woolgathering — and then dropped flat at the sound of shots, five of them in very rapid succession," he recalled in a 1982 Washington Post essay.
When the shooting stopped, he spotted a soldier nearby on his back, “and amid all that drab — the green of his fatigues, the black stock of his M16, the sweaty gray of his T-shirt — a small red hole in his heart," Mr. Just wrote.
“My journalist's eye — this is the eye they pay you for and that, in turn, you pay for too, sometimes, in some coin — registered that his cigarette was burning on the ground beside him, a Lucky Strike," he wrote, adding that the soldier had “died before the cigarette did, and I find that now a cheap irony, though I didn't then. From details such as these, according to the canons of journalism, I knew, you could make something larger."
Born in Michigan City, Ind., on Sept. 5, 1935, Ward Swift Just was the son of Franklin Ward Just and Elizabeth Swift.
Mr. Just's grandfather and father served successively as publisher of the Waukegan News-Sun, and he grew up in that Chicago suburb, and in nearby Lake Forest.
“From my earliest moments, my dream was to write fiction," Mr. Just said in 2004. “I wrote a play when I was in the fourth grade and wrote short stories all the way through grade school, prep school, and most of the way through college."
After graduating from Cranbrook, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., boarding school, Mr. Just went to Trinity College in Hartford, “from which I never graduated but attended more or less faithfully for four years," he recalled in 1982. “I didn't graduate because academe was never my long suit. The only thing I ever wanted to do was write, so I either failed or got D's in everything besides history and courses in creative writing."
Upon his return to Illinois, he found working for his father at the family newspaper an ill fit.
“We fought about how the paper should be organized, what I ought to be doing on the paper, what I was doing, what he should be doing, what he was doing. The problem, essentially, was his shadow. He cast a long one, and I don't like shadows a whole lot," Mr. Just said in 1982, and added: “The only way out was to leave."
He ended up writing for Newsweek magazine, eventually under Ben Bradlee in the Washington bureau. When Bradlee went to The Washington Post, he hired Mr. Just.
After returning from Vietnam, where he had been injured by shrapnel from a grenade, Mr. Just wrote his first book, “To What End: Report From Vietnam."
Then he covered the 1968 presidential bids of Eugene McCarthy and Richard M. Nixon (“a campaign of oceanic tedium," he told the Globe) and wrote editorials for the Post, but “I knew I was finished," he said in 2004. “I was a pretty good war correspondent, but I had absolutely no desire to go back to that war or any other war. With newspaper reporting, you've got to have a lust for news if you're going to do it well. I had lost it."
He wrote his first novel — “A Soldier of the Revolution" (1970) — and was principally a fiction writer ever after. His other novels included “An Unfinished Season" (2004), which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
“He should have won the Pulitzer half a dozen times," the writer Frederick Busch, who died in 2006, told the Globe in 2004.
Mr. Just's first two marriages, to Jean Ramsay and Anne Burling, ended in divorce.
In 1983, he married Sarah Catchpole, with whom he lived in Paris for several years before settling permanently on Martha's Vineyard, where they had lived part time.
In addition to Catchpole, Mr. Just's survivors include his children from his previous marriages, Jennifer of Woodbridge, Conn., Julia of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Ian of Arlington; and six grandchildren.
Information about a memorial service was not immediately available.
Describing his writing process, Mr. Just said his novels emerged from the writing itself — “I draft and redraft."
“I'm not one to outline," he said in 1982. “I start with the first sentence and never know where I am going to end up. I never know the first sentence until I know the last. That changes."
And switching from journalism to fiction required a realignment of his approach, including paring down the details he included in his prose.
“Factual material can overwhelm the vessel," he said in 2004. “I do think that what is going on behind the eyelids is more important than the eyelids. If you spend a lot of time on descriptive details, that detracts from what is going on inside a character, which you know by gesture and language."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — As a native New Yorker, writer Michael Powell had a lot of adjusting to do — to the landscape, lifestyle and culture — when he moved to Fort Defiance, Arizona, a quarter century ago where his wife was a midwife for the Indian Health Service.
Powell, his wife and their two young sons took up residence in a trailer on the Navajo Nation in 1993. That months-long experience might have turned out to be just an unusual footnote in Powell's life after he went on to become a sports writer and columnist for The New York Times.
Instead, it became something much greater — an introduction for Powell into how the sport of basketball permeates and reflects society on the Navajo Nation, where high-octane "rez ball" draws huge, intense crowds to high school gyms that regularly exceed the population of a given town.
Powell's interest, and storytelling instincts, were aroused. It would be years before he fully acted on them, but he returned to northeast Arizona a few years ago to chronicle the quest for a state title by the 2016-17 Chinle High School boys basketball team and its coach, Raul Mendoza. The author shares what he observed in his book "Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation," recently published by Blue Rider Press, an imprint of Penguin/Random House.
Those experiences of living on the Navajo Nation and exploring the passion of its people for basketball — something Powell shares, given his New York upbringing — had a profound effect on him, the author said.
"In the sense of that place, that land, that culture, yes," he said during a telephone interview on Dec. 19 from Milwaukee, where he was traveling to cover that night's NBA heavyweight battle between the hometown Bucks and the visiting Los Angeles Lakers for The Times. "The hooks were in before, but now the hooks go pretty damn deep."
Powell rented a studio apartment in Chinle throughout the season. He described the differences between his stay there and his normal life in Brooklyn with a mix of wonder and bemusement.There was the joy of being able to get up every morning and go for a hike in Canyon de Chelly National Park instead of enduring yet another subway ride, he said. But that was balanced by the frustrations of dealing with limited cell phone service and quickly learning the wisdom of stocking up on groceries and other household necessities during his frequent trips to Albuquerque, Gallup or Flagstaff.
Mostly, though, Powell was there to immerse himself in the culture and try to understand why basketball had such a hold on its people. One of his first steps was developing a sense of trust with his subjects.
"It's not a strictly linear culture, not like setting up a bunch of interviews and doing them in a row — not that that's the best way to go about it anyway," he said. "It's more like you want to be there when the chances present themselves. I found people quite welcoming as long as you put in your time — and put being a Type A New Yorker aside."
Powell, long accustomed to covering sports at the college and professional level, reveled in the access he had to the players and coaches in Chinle.
"The great aspect of writing about a high school team is, you can just walk into the locker room and be there every day at practice," he said, comparing that experience to the limits placed on him as a media member covering the NBA, "where you're looking at it with your nose pressed to the glass."
Even with that increased access, there were some obvious differences to be gotten over as he built relationships with the players, Powell noted. After all, he was an older, Anglo guy trying to relate to Native teenage boys.
"So, it's different. But no one was hostile to me in the least," he said.
Biding his time and making the effort to blend in, Powell eventually found himself invited to some family dinners — large, elaborate gatherings that included extended aunts, uncles and grandparents. One of his lasting impressions about social life on the Navajo Nation, he said, was the range of everyday discussions.
"I would get into conversations about things that are sometimes quite a bit deeper than you would find in New York or Albuquerque," he said. "It's that sense of tradition that cuts beyond what you immediately see on the surface."
Powell's efforts to relate the story of a distinct, geographically isolated place and culture, not just write a book about a high school sports team, make it nearly impossible not to compare "Canyon Dreams" to "Friday Night Lights," H.G. "Buzz" Bissinger's seminal 1990 account of a season with the Permian High School football team in Odessa, Texas, a community where football had taken on a grossly outsized importance. That book not only became a bestseller, spawning a film version and TV series, it became the gold standard for books of that genre.
Powell acknowledged "Canyon Dreams" covers many of the same elements as Bissinger's book, but he said he never worried about his book being characterized as a basketball or Navajo version of "Friday Night Lights."
"I'm aware that the book exists," he said. "I even read part of it years ago. In fact, I took it with me and decided not to read it. I didn't want to have it like a parrot talking to me in my ear. I only recently read it, but it never served as a template for me, even though it's a beautiful, brilliant book."
It has long been the job of writers to cast their stories in a multidimensional fashion, Powell said, one that examines a central theme — in this case, basketball — from a 360-degree perspective.
"How do you tell more than that one aspect of a story? How do you tell more than a politics story if that's what you're writing? You do it by telling a story in the round," he said. "There have plenty of other books that have done a similar deep dive. And when you start getting compared to something like ("Friday Night Lights"), that's probably a sign that you did you job."
With "Friday Night Lights," Bissinger succeeded in drawing a nuanced and empathetic yet honest portrait of an entire community, not a mere sports book. Powell hopes he has done something similar with "Canyon Dreams."
"If he had written a formulaic football book, bad on him, and bad on me, if that's what I had tried to do," Powell said. "But he didn't. And I think this is a really good goal to shoot for in a broader sense."
In the forward to his book, Bissinger wrote of the tremendous affection he developed for the community and especially the players after a year spent living in Odessa to research "Friday Night Lights." While reporters and writers are taught to maintain a professional distance from their subjects, Powell said he never worried about avoiding those feelings during his extended stay in Chinle.
"If you're being honest with yourself, if you spend that much time somewhere, you can't help but start to feel the job or the pain of the people you're writing about," he said. "I don't worry about that aspect at all. ... You have to feel what people are going through. The bigger challenge is writing about it in a clear-eyed way. I think I did that."

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: A Defining Generation Becomes a Label for Irrelevance

Texto completo: [OK Boomer]
As 2019 ends, various dictionary publishers are choosing their "Word of the Year," a term they believe has surged the most in usage and importance. The originator of this practice, the American Dialect Society, makes its choice on Jan. 3, and this time the gathering of scholars will also pick a "Word of the Decade."
Full disclosure: As chair of the society's New Words Committee, I'll be overseeing the selections. Earlier this week, I visited my son's eighth-grade class at his Jersey City middle school to give a talk about the process, and I asked the students what their nomination would be for 2019. Several piped up with "boomer" and "OK boomer."
My Generation Z audience then proceeded to break down the significance of an epithet that has indeed made a big impact over the past year. For millennials and especially post-millennials, "OK boomer" has become a sly linguistic weapon of intergenerational warfare.
In its current use as a put-down, "boomer" has strayed from its original meaning referring to members of the baby boom generation born after World War II -- and long known, partly thanks to their outsize numbers, as powerful trendsetters for the culture as a whole. Members of the postwar generation began to be called "baby boomers" as early as 1963 and simply "boomers" by 1974.
But in Generation Z parlance, "boomer" can be applied to anyone older who has a condescending or out-of-touch attitude toward young people and their concerns. As my Gen Z son puts it, "It's not an age group -- it's a mind-set." (Confusion over what exactly "boomer" means now is reflected in "what is a boomer" being one of Google's top searches in 2019.)
The full phrase "OK boomer" has been embraced as a handy retort to mock anyone stodgily complaining about kids today, with the kids themselves spreading the expression in viral fashion on video-sharing platforms like TikTok. The phrase was mostly percolating under the radar until it garnered major media attention in late October, in widely shared articles from NBC News and the New York Times.
Pretty soon "OK boomer" was everywhere, and the backlash from the older side of the generational divide was swift. Conservative radio host Bob Lonsberry, in a now-deleted tweet, went so far as to declare that "boomer" is now "the n-word of ageism." Myrna Blyth, editorial director of AARP Media, told Axios, "OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money." Others have tried out "OK zoomer" as a comeback to the comeback, using "zoomer" as a snarky label for Generation Z.
The phrase next made international news: Chloe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of New Zealand's Parliament, became an online sensation when she used "OK boomer" to respond to heckling of a climate-change speech she was giving. In U.S. politics, meanwhile, targets of the jibe have included 77-year-old former vice president Joe Biden (born before the baby boom generation, whose members now range from 55 to 73). As I mentioned in a previous column, one Iowa voter reacting to Mr. Biden's old-fashioned campaign slogan "No Malarkey" told Politico, "I'm afraid he's going to be disregarded as, 'OK boomer.'"
"Boomer" talk has even crossed linguistic boundaries. This week, Van Dale, a dictionary publisher in the Netherlands, announced "boomer" as the Dutch Word of the Year after an online vote of more than 17,000 people. In New Zealand, thanks to Ms. Swarbrick, "OK boomer" topped a "Word of the Year" poll held by media commentator Russell Brown. Will the American Dialect Society similarly honor "OK boomer"? If it loses out, I can guess what the terse response from those eighth-graders is going to be.

Texto completo: Researchers said the profiles, linked to the Epoch Media Group, used photos generated by artificial intelligence in a preview of an "eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation."
Facebook said on Friday that it had removed hundreds of accounts with ties to the Epoch Media Group, parent company of the Falun Gong-related publication and conservative news outlet The Epoch Times.
The accounts, including pages, groups and Instagram feeds meant to be seen in both the United States and Vietnam, presented a new wrinkle to researchers: fake profile photos generated with the help of artificial intelligence.
The idea that artificial intelligence could be used to create wide-scale disinformation campaigns has long been a fear of computer scientists. And they said it was worrying to see it already being used in a coordinated effort on Facebook.
While the technology used to create the fake profile photos was most likely a far cry from the sophisticated A.I. systems being created in labs at big tech companies like Google, the network of fake accounts showed "an eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation," said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Scientists have already shown that machines can generate images and sounds that are indistinguishable from the real thing or spew vast volumes of fake text, which could accelerate the creation of false and misleading information. This year, researchers at a Canadian company even built a system that learned to imitate the voice of the podcaster Joe Rogan by analyzing audio from his old podcasts. It was a shockingly accurate imitation.
The people behind the network of 610 Facebook accounts, 89 Facebook Pages, 156 Groups and 72 Instagram accounts posted about political news and issues in the United States, including President Trump's impeachment, conservative ideology, political candidates, trade and religion.
"This was a large, brazen network that had multiple layers of fake accounts and automation that systematically posted content with two ideological focuses: support of Donald Trump and opposition to the Chinese government," Mr. Brookie said in an interview.
The Atlantic Council's lab and another company, Graphika, which also studies disinformation, released a joint report analyzing the Facebook takedown.
The Epoch Media Group denied in an email sent to The New York Times that it was linked to the network targeted by Facebook, and said that Facebook had not contacted the company before publishing its conclusions.
The people behind the network used artificial intelligence to generate profile pictures, Facebook said. They relied on a type of artificial intelligence called generative adversarial networks. These networks can, through a process called machine learning, teach themselves to create realistic images of faces, even though they do not belong to a real person.
Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, said in an interview that "using A.I.-generated photos for profiles" has been talked about for several months, but for Facebook, this is "the first time we've seen a systemic use of this by actors or a group of actors to make accounts look more authentic."
He added that this A.I. technique did not actually make it harder for the company's automated systems to detect the fakes, because the systems focus on patterns of behavior among accounts.
Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, said that "we need more research into A.I.-generated imagery like this, but it takes a lot more to hide a fake network than just the profile pictures."
Facebook said the accounts masked their activities by using a combination of fake and authentic American accounts to manage pages and groups on the platforms. The coordinated, inauthentic activity, Facebook said, revolved around the media outlet The BL -- short for "The Beauty of Life" -- which the fact-checking outlet Snopes said in November was "building a fake empire on Facebook and getting away with it."
Mr. Gleicher said Facebook began its investigation into The BL in July, and accelerated its efforts when the network became more aggressive in posting this fall. It is continuing to investigate "other links and networks" tied to The BL, he said.
Facebook said the network had spent less than $ 9.5 million on Facebook and Instagram ads. On Friday, Facebook said The BL would be banned from the social network.
The Epoch Times and The BL have denied being linked, but Facebook said it had found coordinated, inauthentic behavior from the network to the Epoch Media Group and individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf.
The Epoch Media Group said in its email that The BL was founded by a former employee and employs some of its former employees. "However, that some of our former employees work for BL is not evidence of any connection between the two organizations," the company said.
A Facebook spokeswoman said executives The BL were active administrators on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as Friday morning.
In August, Facebook banned advertising from The Epoch Times after NBC News published a report that said The Epoch Times had obscured its connection to Facebook ads promoting President Trump and conspiracy content.
Twitter said on Friday that the social network was also aware of The BL network, and had already "identified and suspended approximately 700 accounts originating from Vietnam for violating our rules around platform manipulation." A company spokeswoman added that its investigation was still open, but Twitter has not identified links between the accounts and state-backed actors.
Facebook also said on Friday that it had taken down a network of more than 300 pages and 39 Facebook accounts and their coordinated, inauthentic activities on domestic political news in Georgia.
Facebook said the network tried to conceal its coordination but it found that the accounts responsible were run by the Georgian Dream-led government, and Panda, a local advertising agency in the country. The owners of the Facebook pages masqueraded as news organizations and impersonated public figures, political parties and activist groups.
In a related move, Twitter said it also took down 32 million tweets from nearly 6,000 accounts related to a Saudi Arabian social media marketing company called Smaat, which ran political and commercial influence operations.
Smaat was led in part by Ahmed Almutairi, a Saudi man wanted by the F.B.I. on charges that he recruited two Twitter employees to search internal company databases for information about critics of the Saudi government, said Renee DiResta, a disinformation researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which separately analyzed Twitter's takedown.
The operation was "extremely high volume," and automatically generated by "Twitter apps that made religious posts, posts about the weather" and other topics, Ms. DiResta said.
At times, the accounts were used for "more tailored purposes," including more than 17,000 tweets related to Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and columnist for The Washington Post, who was killed while visiting a Saudi consulate in October last year.
Many of the tweets claimed that those criticizing the Saudi government for their involvement were doing so for their own political purposes.

One lab director said the discovery showed "an eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation." (PHOTOGRAPHS BY GRAPHIKA/THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S DIGITAL FORENSIC RESEARCH LAB) (B4)

California Coastal Waters Are Acidifying at an Insane Rate—Here’s Why It Matters

Texto completo: A new study, conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has results that will make you more disturbed about the state of climate change. The scientific agency’s research has shown that the waters off the coast of California are acidifying twice as fast as the rest of the oceans around the world.
What does this mean exactly?
SEE ALSO: Even a Coal-Powered Tesla Is Greener Than a Normal Car
Here’s a staggering statistic: roughly 27% of all carbon dioxide emitted since 1959 has gone into the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. Put into the mix that California is the second highest producer of carbon dioxide in the country (right behind Texas, which, incidentally, doesn’t have an ocean), and you have a date with ecosystem disaster.
Have you seen the air around Los Angeles? Pretty crappy isn’t it? In 2018, the region violated federal smog standards for 87 consecutive days. That violation took home the record for the longest stretch of bad air in the past 20 years. The smog around L.A. sometimes makes your eyes water.
Hmmm, do you think there’s a connection to the massive amount of traffic and lack of decent public transport in the area to what’s going on with the waters off the coast?
So, while we, humans, continue to pollute the atmosphere with more and more planet-warming carbon dioxide, the ocean off the California coast has become like a carbon sponge. The carbon dioxide gas is absorbed in huge quantities by seawater. In turn, the oceans keep the planet from getting hotter than it already has.
And the crazed record heat that Californians have been experiencing is no fluke. In fact, in the last five years, California temperatures have been the hottest in 124 years.
And guess what?
The result makes the ocean more acidic, which is commonly referred to as ocean acidification . It has not only devastating effects on the ocean off the California coast but also around the globe. (Spoiler Alert: In general, oceans around the world are now 30% more acidic than they were before the industrial revolution.)
But let’s get back to California.
The study has also made connections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle that scientists have noted is playing a major role in the higher and faster rates of sea level rise hitting California. In recent years, this has come in the form of such major storms as El Niño and La Niña. Researchers have found these climatic change cycles have also added stress to the extreme changes we’ve seen in the ocean’s chemistry.
So what does this mean for Californians, in particular?
Well, it threatens the nation’s most economically valuable fisheries. Also, the carbon dioxide that has turned the seawater acidic devastates shell-forming species and corals. Researchers reconstructed a 100-year history of acidification along the West Coast by collecting and analyzing a specific type of shell on the seafloor. They used the data to determine that since 1900, shells have gotten 20% thinner—indicating an increase in acidic waters which blocks the chemicals sea creatures use to form shells.
Dr. Emily Osborne, one of the study’s authors, told The New York Times : “I could just watch the shells literally getting thinner as I moved up through the record and got closer to the present day.”
While the ocean serves an important role in mitigating climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, there will come a point at which oceans can’t absorb anymore.
“This makes the extremes even more extreme. It’s like a double whammy for this region of the world,” said Osborne. “From this study, and so many other published studies, there’s no question that the answer is to curb our carbon emissions.”
Until then, we’ll see you at the next California wildfire, in 120-degree heat, as we pray that sea-life will somehow adapt to this climate change disaster.

For Investing Success, Buy Ugly Shoes, Sell Fake Meat; Heard on the Street's annual stock-picking contest showed the merits of swinging for the fences (one reason readers beat our columnists)

Texto completo: Whoever said that relative performance doesn't put food on the table never worked on Wall Street.
A year ago, Heard on the Street's columnists consoled ourselves with the results of the second annual stock-picking contest by pointing out that we lost less than the overall stock market and also beat an index of hedge-fund managers. This year, the team made a profit, but barely enough for a virtual value meal. The 14 "buy" and 10 "sell" recommendations earned an average return, not including dividends, of just 3.8% over four months. More picks lost money than made money.
While many Heard writers' arguments had holes in them, one did so in a very good way— a "buy" recommendation on Crocs by Hong Kong-based columnist Jacky Wong that preceded a 62% gain. He argued that the company's ugly shoes were gaining support from social influencers and that, despite a strong run over the past year, they remained reasonably valued at 15 times forward earnings. On the other hand, skepticism was warranted for Heard's second-best pick— a recommendation to sell then-sizzling Beyond Meat shares, which lost nearly half of their value.
A large number of Heard's readers also were skeptical about the surging stock's prospects. Despite being a new and not especially large company, Beyond Meat was the 2nd-most-picked stock out of over 7,000 entries and one of the few that had more readers betting against it than for it.
Subscribers weren't laughing all the way to the virtual bank with some other popular negative bets, though. For example, Tesla, which attracted a record 282 picks and also the most "sell" recommendations at 195, rose sharply. While it wasn't one of our columnists' selections, Heard columnist Charley Grant wasn't enthused about the company after its October share-price surge on a surprise quarterly profit. Netflix was another popular "sell" with 126 out of 166 readers thinking it would drop. The stock rose modestly despite the emergence of stiff competition in the so-called Streaming Wars.
Another stock frequently in the news, former blue chip General Electric, attracted 98 sells out of 150 picks, but the stock rose by about 10%. It had briefly cratered in August, right when the contest began, after Harry Markopolos, the forensic accountant who had warned authorities about Bernard Madoff, made sensational claims about accounting irregularities. Heard wrote these claims "had little merit." And, despite possibly reading somewhere on Twitter that it is "failing, " readers betting against New York Times Co. had all the losses fit to print.
By contrast, there were some stocks that were universally loved by readers. Such unanimity is usually a sign to steer clear, but it wasn't in these cases. Retailers Dollar General and Lumber Liquidators both rose, and the latter was the third-best performer among columnists' picks. It was briefly the top performer following reports that its founder had purchased shares on the open market and might take the company private. He instead sold most of them for what was reportedly a nearly 50% gain .
Stocks rose overall with the S&P 500 gaining 8.6% during the contest. In such an environment, it should come as little surprise that optimism paid off for both columnists and subscribers. Four of the top five Heard picks were "buy" recommendations while four of the five worst ones were "sells." Some 42% of Heard's picks called for stocks to fall while only 21% of readers bet against stocks. That helps to explain readers' superior results—an average profit of 5.1%, some 1.3 percentage points better than Heard's scribes.
Share Your Tips
What advice do you have for stock pickers? Join the conversation below.
There is a wry saying on Wall Street that a long-term investment is a short-term one that didn't work out. While Heard's picks relied more on fundamental analysis than short-term sentiment and may yet redeem themselves, most readers grasped the key to glory in a short-term contest with imaginary money: You either go big or go home .
All five of the top reader picks were money-losing drug-development companies led by Forty Seven Inc., Chemocentryx and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. Many of the worst picks were companies close to the precipice such as Dean Foods and Superior Energy Services, which stumbled rather than rebounding. Try to catch a falling knife and you'll probably wind up bloodied. Skeptical bets on loss-making exercise-band maker Fitbit, by contrast, blew up when Google agreed to buy the company.
Heard's writers, after three years of being mostly humbled by the market—and this year also by our readers—can see the wisdom in legendary investor Benjamin Graham's words that in the short run, the market is merely a "voting machine." As we dust ourselves off, we take heart in the continuation of the quote: that in the long run it's a "weighing machine."

Texto completo: For years, air quality in the U.S. steadily improved. And just like that, deaths related to air pollution fell off, too.
However, in 2017 and 2018, new data show, the amount of fine-particle air pollution got worse, with concentrations rising 5.5 percent after falling by 24.2 percent the previous five years.
The reversal made a real difference in the lives of thousands of Americans. Using reliable formulas that reflect the relationship between pollution and mortality, researchers say in 2018 alone, worsening air quality can be linked to more than 10,000 additional deaths.
Fine-particle air pollution - from tailpipes of cars and trucks, and smokestacks at factories and power plants - is very harmful. Measuring less than 1/30th the width of a human hair, it can be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream. It has been linked to heart disease and stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It can lead to lower test scores and work productivity.
Regulations have gone a long way in limiting the bad effects of air pollution. But even as pollution fell, by one measurement dropping the number of deaths related to it by 47 percent in the two decades prior to 2010, it could still be blamed in part for 71,000 deaths that year - as many as fatal shootings and car accidents combined. In 2015, even as every county in the U.S. met federal air quality standards, pollution was responsible for more than 30,000 deaths.
It's a problem, and now it's getting worse, again.
Americans have driven more and used more natural gas over the last two years, part of the reason pollution is on the rise. Wildfires, mainly in California, also played a role.
But also cited as a factor were actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, beginning during the Obama administration and given the throttle under President Trump.
Enforcement of the Clean Air Act began to fall off under Obama but fell precipitously under Trump. The Trump administration also has rolled back 24 rules and regulations related to air quality, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Last year, the EPA disbanded a panel of experts who advised the agency on fine-particle pollution, replacing it with consultants from the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries.
And when the EPA found that eliminating the Clean Power Plan - which sought to lower carbon emissions from power generators - would cost an additional 1,400 premature deaths, the Trump administration decided to change the way such calculations are made.
In short, against all scientific evidence, the EPA now says that cleaner air does not lead to better health.
That is simply not the case. Ignoring the very real problems caused by air pollution will only allow it to get worse, affecting the health of tens of thousands of Americans each year.

Texto completo: America's defenders of democracy take a stand.
Wednesday's impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We've known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know, as surely as we can know anything in politics, that a Republican-controlled Senate won't convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that's not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of my fellow citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day -- a day of both despair and hope.
The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference -- that true American exceptionalism -- will be enough to save us.
Let's back up and ask what we've learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they were doing so, the object of their adoration was giving an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they've become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. And like similar parties in other countries, the G.O.P. is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump's supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don't.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary's Fidesz and Poland's Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition -- disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect on Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I'd like to dismiss such concerns, but I can't.
Add in the extent to which next year's election will be rigged in Trump's favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College -- and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population -- and it's all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won't give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else's. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: The day after voting against impeaching President Trump, the New Jersey representative appeared with him in the Oval Office to announce he would leave the Democratic Party for the Republicans.
WASHINGTON -- The day after he defected from Democrats to vote against impeaching President Trump, Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey on Thursday appeared in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump to make it official: He was becoming a Republican.
Sitting beside the president and Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, Mr. Van Drew, who told his staff over the weekend that he planned to leave the Democratic Party, pledged his "undying support" to Mr. Trump.
"I believe that this is just a better fit for me," Mr. Van Drew said. "This is who I am."
The announcement -- put on the president's calendar just one day earlier -- neatly concluded nearly a week of chaos for Mr. Van Drew after word leaked out over the weekend that he was preparing to switch parties, and courting Mr. Trump's support for his move. And it showcased a mutually beneficial political union between two native New Yorkers who each find themselves isolated in different ways.
Mr. Trump began the day on Thursday grappling with his new status as an impeached president. Mr. Van Drew, a centrist freshman who was one of the few Democrats to break with the party on Wednesday and oppose impeaching Mr. Trump, began the day as a pariah among members of his old party.
But at the White House, as he proclaimed himself a Republican, Mr. Van Drew, who swapped his usual checkered blue jacket for a somber dark suit with a red tie, reveled in the public embrace of a president who carried his district by nearly five percentage points. He also delivered a wide-ranging jeremiad from his seat in the Oval Office, often employing Republican talking points: railing against socialism and the Green New Deal, and lamenting what he called the demise of American exceptionalism and respect for the American flag among Democratic lawmakers.
"I didn't leave my party. My party left me," he said, quoting President Ronald Reagan. "And I'm saying the same thing."
For Mr. Trump, the subtext of the New Jersey lawmaker's support fit neatly into his preferred impeachment narrative: that Democrats had alienated even their own by taking the extreme step of seeking to remove him.
"Democrats impeachment is so compelling," Andrew Clark, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, wrote on Twitter, that "one Democrat actually switched parties. Great post-game!"
Mr. Van Drew's conversion to the Republican Party began as a discussion between allies of Mr. Trump and the congressman's associates over the past few months, according to people familiar with the conversations. Mr. Trump had asked several associates about it after seeing Mr. Van Drew vote against the ground rules for the impeachment inquiry.
Just how much Mr. Trump's backing will help Mr. Van Drew, a former dentist and state legislator, remains to be seen. Several Republican candidates already planning on running for the district's Republican nomination have warily eyed Mr. Van Drew's defection while making clear they intend to stay in the race.
But Mr. Van Drew was facing two unappealing options: most likely lose as a Democrat, or roll the dice and see if he could win as a Republican.
Only last month, Mr. Van Drew seemed to regard the Democratic Party as a perfectly good fit; he vowed that he would remain a Democrat even as he continued to oppose impeachment. But that was before he saw the results of a poll of Democratic primary voters that made plain that he was exceedingly vulnerable in his district, with more than 70 percent saying they would be less likely to support him if he voted against impeaching Mr. Trump.
Mr. Van Drew met privately with Mr. Trump in the residence of the White House last Friday, with Mr. Trump's top adviser, Kellyanne Conway, in attendance, according to two people briefed on the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Mr. Van Drew sought assurances from the president, and Mr. Trump said he would support him publicly, those briefed said.
Others who were closely involved were Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's, and who still holds extensive sway with Republicans in the state. Bill Stepien, the White House political director, has deep ties in New Jersey and was intimately involved in the effort. He spent the past 10 days in the southern part of the state to work his contacts to help the move come about, according to two Trump advisers.
Congressional Democrats condemned Mr. Van Drew's move. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the House Democrats' campaign arm, demanded in a scathing statement that Mr. Van Drew apologize to his constituents for "betraying their trust" in a "misguided attempt to save his own political future." (Omitted from the statement was that Mr. Van Drew had also betrayed the trust of the campaign arm, which had intervened in his primary to support him when he won the seat last year.)
Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, was blunter.
"Do you know what we would have done with a guy like that in my neighborhood in Paterson?" Mr. Pascrell told reporters, adding, "I don't advocate violence."
Before he was elected to Congress, Mr. Van Drew cut a conservative figure in the New Jersey legislature, earning a 100 percent approval rating from the National Rifle Association and voting in 2012 against the state's proposed Marriage Equality Act.
Reveling in Mr. Van Drew's anticipated defection on Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, Mr. McCarthy boasted that he could not remember "the last time someone left the majority party to join the minority party."
Referring to comments made earlier in the day by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California that she had a "spring in her step" on Thursday because of the "moral courage" of her caucus, Mr. McCarthy offered his own interpretation.
"That may be true," he said. "Because her conference is going to be a little smaller, and a little lighter."

Texto completo: Robert Mustin had just quit his job and was without health insurance for about four months when he ended up in the Tulare Regional Medical Center emergency room, first in May and then again in July 2014.
The Tulare resident, now 31, didn't think about those two visits until three years later when he was contacted by Kings Credit Services asking him to pay bills that totaled $4,409 for emergency room care and lab tests. The unpaid bills had prompted the credit company to file a lawsuit against Mustin.
Mustin, a truck driver who is often between gigs, was alarmed at the looming debt. He was making just under $22,000 annually at the time, according to his 2016 tax return.
"I tried to work something out with the hospital, but they told me it was too late, and I had to just work with the collection agency by that time," said Mustin, who declined to discuss his reason for visiting the ER, citing privacy concerns.
As he tried to figure out how to resolve the debt he couldn't pay, Mustin stumbled on California's Hospital Fair Pricing Policies, which since January 2007 have mandated that acute care hospitals limit medical bills to the Medicaid reimbursement rate for the uninsured or families with incomes at or below 350% of the federal poverty level — $90,125 in 2019 for a family of four or $43,125 for a single person like Mustin.
This is called charity care. Federal law reinforces this with similar rules for nonprofit hospitals, like Tulare Regional Medical Center. The hospital is now Adventist Health Tulare, after Adventist acquired it in mid-2019.
Hospitals charge private insurance companies a higher rate than they charge government health insurance programs, such as Medicare or Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid program), according to investigations from The New York Times and Kaiser Health News. So, the law says, hospitals can't charge more than the Medi-Cal rate for low-income, uninsured patients. Additionally, hospitals are required to inform patients they can apply for the charity care rate, including posting signs to make the information visible to the public.
Mustin was not informed about the charity care rate or offered an application (in his case, the rate would have been about $573, instead of the billed $4,409). Social justice law firms say it's a common problem.
"A huge problem for the uninsured clients we deal with is people not getting charity care," said Tashara Kuspa, an attorney at Central California Legal Services who focuses on health consumer law. "When patients call and say they can't pay a bill, instead of the hospital offering charity care, they ask, 'Well, what kind of payment can you make?' And then the bill ends up getting to collections and interest starts accruing."
Hospitals in California cut the amount they spent on charity care by half between 2013 and 2017, according to data hospitals reported to California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The biggest drop came after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, according to a report from Kaiser Health News. The spending has continued to decline since then.
In 2018, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra declined three California hospitals' request to be freed from charity care obligations and ordered them to pay millions of dollars to local nonprofits to meet their 2016 charity care requirement. Mission Community Hospital in Los Angeles had to donate $1.7 million; Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock had to donate $1.9 million; and the University of Southern California's Verdugo Hills Hospital had to donate $1.7 million.
The hospitals argued that they should be required to spend less on charity care following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, as most people should have been insured and not in need of financial assistance as a result of the law.
But Mustin was like many others who qualified for Medi-Cal but didn't enroll in coverage. In the 2017-2018 enrollment year, an estimated 529,000 uninsured people were eligible but not enrolled in Medi-Cal, according to the California Health Interview Survey. University of California researchers estimate that 730,000 uninsured people will be eligible for Medi-Cal in 2020 but will not enroll.
Mustin didn't enroll in Medi-Cal at that time because he said he didn't plan to be unemployed long and thought he would have an employer-offered health plan soon. The Medi-Cal application is 36 pages long. Once the application is submitted to the state, the applicant must wait for the state's approval, making sure he or she qualifies for subsidized care, before accessing the benefits.
It can take 45 to 60 days to process an application. For someone who believes he won't be uninsured long, it might not seem worth the effort to apply. In this case, Mustin didn't expect to be unemployed for four months.
He didn't anticipate ending up in the emergency room twice during his employment gap either.
When the collections agency started inundating him with mail and phone calls in early 2017, he decided to take the issue into his own hands before reaching out to Central California Legal Services in Fresno. He started by sending letters to Tulare Regional Medical Center and Kings Credit Services notifying them of the charity care law.
"I believe that I should have been offered and granted financial assistance ... for the medical services that I received ... I am uninsured, and the hospital did not inform me that I could apply for financial assistance," Mustin wrote in a letter to the Kings Credit Services in July 2017.
"I was not given written notice regarding the hospital's charity care or discount payment policy," he wrote in another letter to the hospital the same month.
Soon after Mustin sent those letters, Joy Dockter, an attorney at Central California Legal Services, stepped in to help Mustin argue his case.
By early March 2018, the interim CEO of Tulare Regional Medical Center, Larry Blitz, had admitted to Dockter that Mustin's medical bills should have been waived because he wasn't offered charity care, according to court records from Tulare County Superior Court.
"I apologize (on) behalf of the (Tulare Local Health Care District) and want to assure you that our new management team and Board of Directors shall fully comply with these laws and regulations," Blitz wrote in a letter to Dockter in March 2018.
The law firm has routinely assisted with charity care lawsuits, in addition to reaching out to hospitals about their charity care practices.
"There are definitely some hospital systems that are worse than others at managing charity care," Kuspa said. "We have reached out to hospitals in the Central Valley and explained to them on a face-to-face level what the law says and what their hospital policy says and what their actual practice is, and how those things aren't lining up. We found a lot of success in doing that."

Texto completo: Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Chatsworth-based MGA Entertainment opened the doors on Thursday to its pop-up store L.O.L. Surprise!.
The company — also known for its line of Bratz dolls — is rolling out the store for a limited time to “surprise and delight fans during the holidays, making them feel like they truly stepped into the L.O.L. Surprise! world,” the company said in a statement.
Visitors are offered an immersive and photo-friendly experience, according to the company. They get to walk through seven interactive surprise installations featuring games, photo moments, fashion walks and products, including Winter Disco experience room.
It just so happens that L.O.L. Surprise! dolls — and MGA — is enjoying a bit of a boom these days, reminiscent of the rise of the Bratz line not so long ago.
As the New York Times recently put it, “L.O.L. Surprise! dolls, are pint sized, candy colored and have impossibly huge eyes, which makes them look like something out of an acid trip.” And then there’s the “stylish hairdos, as well as varying accessories, like a handbag, coffee cup or headband.”
As the holiday buying season ramped up, you could find them all the way from the shelves of Walmart to the web pages of Amazon. Or, in short, everywhere.
MGA, the toy company behind L.O.L Surprise!, just held an open house in August at its 24-acre North American headquarters in Chatsworth for local leaders and reporters to see where nearly 400 employees work — and where many will live.
Referred to as “24,” the project was touted by many, including its founder and CEO Isaac Larian, as a first-of-its-kind development in Los Angeles.
Employees have been working at the site since May. An on-site apartment complex was under construction.
MGA Entertainment Inc, which stands for Micro-Games America Entertainment, was founded in 1979.
The pop-up is at 9220 Winnetka Ave. in Chatsworth.

Virtue Signal from Goldman Sachs; Given the characters with whom Goldie has done business, lawful U.S. energy production is beyond the pale?

Texto completo: Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R., Alaska) says that he and his fellow Alaskans will have to decide "whether we want to do business" with Goldman Sachs anymore. And who can blame Alaska if it chooses to cut ties with the Wall Street megabank?
In an update to its environmental policy, Goldman says: "We will decline any financing transaction that directly supports new upstream Arctic oil exploration or development."
The financial giant is receiving applause from green groups. But in a visit to the Journal this week, Gov. Dunleavy says the decision will have real costs for Alaskans and the U.S. economy while generating unintended environmental consequences. That's because many oil-producing regions of the world have much less stringent environmental regulation than Alaska does. "You're going to push jobs and wealth and revenues" to overseas areas and "exacerbate" ecological problems, adds the governor.
The good news is that if Goldman doesn't want this business, others do. Warren Stephens is Chairman and CEO of Stephens, Inc., among the largest investment banks outside of Wall Street. Mr. Stephens tells this column via email:
We hear many institutions are not investing in traditional energy projects. We think this is short sighted on their part. The US energy business is very dynamic and will offer good returns. It is also extremely important to our country's energy independence. We would welcome the opportunity to help these projects with their capital needs just as we try to help alternative energy projects.
Within reason, Goldman should be allowed to choose with whom it does business. But given the firm's history, it's hard to understand why Alaskans engaged in lawful commerce don't make the cut.
Liz Hoffman and Aruna Viswanatha report today:
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is in talks with the U.S. government to pay a multibillion-dollar fine, admit guilt and agree to continuing oversight of its compliance procedures in order to resolve a criminal investigation into its role in a Malaysian corruption scandal.
Goldman and the Justice Department have largely agreed on a fine of just under $2 billion to settle allegations that the Wall Street firm ignored red flags while billions of dollars were looted from its client, a Malaysian government fund known as 1MDB, people familiar with the matter said.
The bank and U.S. officials have discussed a deal in which a Goldman subsidiary in Asia—not the parent company—would plead guilty to violating U.S. bribery laws, some of the people said.
In April of last year, the Journal's Julie Wernau reported :
Venezuela's cash-strapped government stopped paying its foreign debt months ago. But a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently received payments of tens of millions of dollars for bonds that ignited controversy last year when they were purchased at a big discount, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Venezuelan government made the payment in November, but the money had been held up by a clearing house that processes these payments over concerns that it may have been in violation of U.S. sanctions, these people said.
The purchase in May by Goldman's asset management arm sparked charges that the New York firm was providing a financial lifeline to Venezuela's embattled government. The public anger seemed to catch Goldman off guard, in part because the asset management arm hasn't usually been prone to controversy.
Perhaps someone at Goldman can explain why they were surprised that Venezuela, presided over by tyrant Nicolas Maduro, would attract controversy.
Back in 2007 Guy Chazan reported in the Journal:
MOSCOW -- In Western capitals, Vladimir Putin has an image problem. Politicians in the U.S. and Europe routinely accuse him of squelching domestic dissent, strong-arming foreign oil companies and using Russia's vast energy resources to blackmail neighbors.
One constituency, however, has a strikingly different take on the Russian president. To many investors, Mr. Putin is a hero. The reason: the Russian stock market's spectacular rally during his seven years of rule...
Foreign direct investment, though still low in proportion to the size of the country's economy, doubled last year to $30 billion. Major U.S. investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have ramped up their Moscow operations, drawn there by the emergence of strong, cash-rich Russian companies looking to list overseas and buy assets abroad.
Against that backdrop, the market is ready to indulge Mr. Putin.
Goldman doesn't really have to indulge Alaskans. It could simply avoid treating them as pariahs for producing energy for a world that needs it.
This column should note that in that model of enlightenment known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Goldman is only earning about $3 or $4 million for its role in the recent initial public offering of state-owned oil giant Aramco, according to a recent report from the Journal's Ben Dummett and Julie Steinberg. But don't shed a tear for Goldman—more fees could be in its future as the dictatorship considers an international listing of the world's most profitable producer of fossil fuels.
This column is not arguing that Goldman Sachs is operating at a Clinton Foundation or Hunter Biden level of ethics when it comes to foreign business dealings. But given the international cast of characters with whom Goldie has done business—including some of the world's biggest, least free and most environmentally insensitive petro-regimes, blackballing Alaska's Arctic projects is absurd.

Life &amp; Arts -- Sightings: More Than a Monster: Boris Karloff the Actor

Texto completo: Chuck Jones's much-loved 1966 animated version of Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" will be telecast for the umpteenth time by NBC on Christmas night. The narrator is Boris Karloff, whose speaking voice (he sounded like a kindly Edwardian uncle) will be familiar to anyone who's seen "Grinch," though he was far better known in his own day for having played the heavily made-up monster in James Whale's 1931 screen adaptation of "Frankenstein," the movie that made him a full-fledged star. Julie Harris, who later appeared opposite Karloff on Broadway and TV, called him "a great actor. . . . He had an enormous warmth and humanity, and this fascinating darker quality. It was mysterious. You wanted to know where such a man came from." But unless you've seen "Frankenstein," it's possible that you won't recognize his name -- and you certainly won't know that there was far more to him than the monsters and madmen he played on screen.
Karloff made his professional stage debut in 1910, spending a decade acting in traveling stock companies before moving to Hollywood, where he became a highly admired character actor. His early sound-film performances include striking supporting parts in two fine pre-Code movies, appearing opposite Edward G. Robinson as a drunken, unscrupulous newspaperman in Mervyn LeRoy's "Five Star Final" (1931) and playing a religious fanatic in John Ford's "The Lost Patrol" (1934).
As a result of the success of "Frankenstein," alas, he was permanently typecast, and spent the rest of his life appearing in horror films that were mostly of indifferent quality (remember "Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"?). A few of them, fortunately -- above all "The Body Snatcher" (1945) and "Bedlam" (1946), both produced by Val Lewton, and "Targets" (1968), Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film -- were more than good enough to suggest how sensitive an actor he was beneath the bogeyman makeup that he often wore on screen. He was also highly literate: Joseph Conrad was his favorite novelist, and Mr. Bogdanovich praised his "intelligence and taste that came across on a very high level."
Karloff's first real opportunity to show his stuff came when, in 1941, he returned to the stage after a long absence -- in a comedy. He made his Broadway debut in the original production of "Arsenic and Old Lace," Joseph Kesselring's now-classic black farce, which ran for 1,444 performances. In it, he created the role of Jonathan Brewster, a psychopathic mass murderer whose life is ruined when an alcoholic plastic surgeon inadvertently makes him look like -- yes -- Boris Karloff.
At first he was terrified by the thought of acting in front of live audiences after having spent so long in Hollywood. A month after the show opened, he recalled, "I got on the scales and I had lost 26 pounds -- in sheer fright." But to everyone's amazement, his own included, he turned out to have a knack for comedy, and the rave reviews that he received for "Arsenic" inspired him to continue performing in plays as a more artistically fulfilling sideline.
On top of all this, Karloff even managed to make the transition to the small screen at the dawn of network television. Fortunately for posterity, he appeared in numerous live-TV dramas, some of which were small-screen versions of the plays in which he starred on Broadway. Several of these telecasts were preserved on kinescope and can be viewed on YouTube. They include an excellent 1962 "Hallmark Hall of Fame" version of "Arsenic" in which he shares top billing with Tony Randall -- it's far better than Frank Capra's grossly overacted 1944 film version, in which he was replaced by Raymond Massey -- and an uneven but interesting 1958 "Playhouse 90" adaptation of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" in which he is startlingly vivid as Mr. Kurtz, uttering the line "Exterminate all the brutes!" with shocking conviction.
Best of all is another "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special, this one based on the original Broadway production of a play of real substance. "The Lark," telecast in 1957, was Lillian Hellman's English-language stage adaptation of "L'Alouette," Jean Anouilh's 1952 retelling of the story of Joan of Arc, who was played on both Broadway and TV by Julie Harris. Karloff, cast as the bishop who reluctantly sentenced her to death, once again received glowing reviews for his performance, which Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times praised as "paternal, sorrowful, pleading."
Years later, Harris told Scott Allen Nollen, Karloff's biographer, that working with him in "The Lark" had been "a dream. . .. He would have been great in any play." How remarkable that so heartfelt a tribute should have been paid to Boris Karloff by one of the greatest American stage actors of her generation! Yet to view the TV version of "The Lark" today, even on a faded kinescope, is to be left in no doubt of Karloff's own formidable powers as a stage performer, as well as his ability to grapple with a role of near-classical scope. Not too shabby for a movie monster.

The Technology We Use and Why It Matters

Texto completo: After three years and more than 130 columns, the smartphone was tops. There were also some deliberate Luddites among us.
Several years ago, some colleagues and I were chatting about what was missing from tech journalism. Plenty of news media outlets had written breathlessly about hot new gadgets and apps. But what were people really doing with that tech?
That question spawned Tech We're Using, a weekly feature that documented how New York Times journalists used tech to cover a wide variety of topics, including politics, sports, wars, natural disasters, food and art.
With the decade coming to a close, we decided to also wrap up the column after interviews with more than 130 Times reporters, editors and photographers. Here were our biggest takeaways.
Indispensable Tech: Encryption Apps and Batteries
Unsurprisingly, the smartphone was the most vital work tool among journalists. Many reporters relied on smartphones for recording interviews and turned to A.I.-powered apps like Trint and Rev to automatically transcribe interviews into notes.
Most Times reporters now also rely on some form of encrypted communication, particularly messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp or the emailing service Protonmail, to keep their sources and conversations confidential.
That is a remarkable shift. Encryption technologies became popular only a few years ago, after the former government security contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of what the United States government was doing to surveil its own citizens.
Another indispensable tool underlined a type of tech that has not improved much: batteries. Many reporters, especially national correspondents who live out of a suitcase, desperately needed phones with longer-lasting batteries, so battery packs were a staple in their arsenal of tools.
The Most Tech-Enthused Journalists Were Not Tech Reporters
Some of the reporters who were savviest about using tech worked in politics and investigations. That is because they needed apps to pore through documents that were thousands of pages long, or software tools to inspect what was going on under the hood of a website's code. Others needed special apps to hide their identities with burner phone numbers.
Many photographers were also early adopters of new tech. One key example: drones. Those were constantly getting smaller, and their cameras were improving, which created possibilities for new types of photography, like overhead shots of houses damaged in a fire.
In contrast, many tech reporters tried to minimize the amount of tech they used. That could be, in part, a symptom of knowing too much about the companies they covered and the wide swaths of data those companies collected.
Tech Has Changed Everything
Many editors and reporters also talked about how tech had transformed the industries they cover.
In the world of dining, digital photography and platforms like Instagram have become the main method that restaurants use to communicate with patrons. Rocket launches are now live-streamed online, which let our space reporter watch from his phone instead of heading to the space station. And in the entertainment world, video streaming has opened doors to a wealth of new content -- so much that reporting on movies and TV shows has become an art of curation.
What's ahead? If tech has invaded everything, the answer is: even more transformation.
Photograph The smartphone and a host of apps, most notably those that offer encrypted communication, provide a portal through which Times journalists cover a variety of topics, including politics, sports, wars, natural disasters, food and art.

Texto completo: He traveled with the anthropologist Margaret Mead, teamed up with President Lyndon Johnson and shot for Life and Look, creating revelatory pictures.
Ken Heyman, a leading photographer who worked with Margaret Mead, shot scores of assignments for Life magazine, collaborated with President Lyndon B. Johnson and endlessly sought new, revelatory ways of seeing the world, died on Dec. 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His daughter Jennifer McCarthy confirmed his death.
Mr. Heyman first accompanied Mead, the noted cultural anthropologist, on a trip to Bali in 1957, and he took the photographs for "Family," an acclaimed 1965 collaboration in which the two examined families around the world in images and text.
"The combination," Jacob Deschin wrote in a review in The New York Times, "more integrated than is usual in word and picture associations, should make anthropology palatable for many who might never be inclined to pick up a book on the subject."
The next year he collaborated with President Johnson on "This America: A Portrait of a Nation," a book intended to illustrate Johnson's "Great Society" initiatives. Johnson wrote the text.
Those two books were among more than 40 that Mr. Heyman published, either on his own or in collaboration with writers. Some were whimsical, like a series of children's books with Ann Morris that took a global look at particular subjects ("Bread, Bread, Bread," "Hats, Hats, Hats"). Others documented the grown-up world, like "Pop Art" (1965) and "The Private World of Leonard Bernstein" (1968, with John Gruen).
"Ken Heyman seems to use his skill and the photographic process to allow other people, his subjects, to make their own pitch about themselves," an essay about him in the book "U.S. Camera '62" said. "He doesn't really take pictures of people and things (or, God forbid, grind out endless examples of his own cleverness). He photographs feelings and relationships."
He would often do so from unexpected perspectives, a technique illustrated by "Hipshot: One-Handed, Auto-Focus Photographs by a Master Photographer," a 1988 book of images shot with a cheap camera held at knee height, resting on the ground or otherwise positioned to capture an unusual perspective. Kelly Wise, in a review in The Boston Globe, called it "a book that almost hums with its own street sounds."
Kenneth Louis Heyman was born on Oct. 6, 1930, in Manhattan to David and Ruth (Stein) Heyman. He first became interested in photography in high school, and once he enrolled at Columbia College he continued to pursue that passion, taking photographs for the campus newspaper, working late in the darkroom so often that he tended to sleep through his morning classes.
"I was put on scholastic probation," he said in a 2012 video interview for the website What If It Really Works, "and during the Korean War those people were drafted."
After two years in the Army, from 1952 to 1954, he returned to Columbia.
Studying to be a social worker, he tried one of the popular classes being taught by Mead. She invited students to include photographs with their final papers, and Mr. Heyman turned the invitation into a photo essay about boys he had been working with at a settlement house in Harlem.
"I got my first A," he said, "and she called me into her office and said she wanted me to take her graduate course," even though he wasn't a graduate student. Not long after, she invited him to join her on a trip to Bali as her photographer, which he did after graduating in 1956.
Mr. Heyman had also begun going on assignments for Life magazine. In a 2014 interview with Sharpen, the online magazine of the American Society of Media Photographers, he explained how that came about.
"I was shooting a project for myself that I called 'Broadway Islands,' pictures of people around 112th Street, near Columbia," he said. "I walked into the magazine's office and showed them these images. They accepted the work and included it in their series known as 'Speaking of Pictures."'
He had essentially no formal photography training.
"The summer between my junior and senior year at Columbia I took a class at an art institute in the city," he said. "I was kicked out because they thought I wasn't serious enough. Working for Life magazine was my training ground."
He ultimately shot more than 150 assignments for the magazine, he said. Other magazines to feature his work included Time and Look.
In 1975 Mr. Heyman collaborated with Mead, who died in 1978, on a second book, "World Enough." He traveled all over the world photographing various cultures and customs, but he also photographed his share of household names, including Ernest Hemingway and Elizabeth Taylor. He especially liked to tell the story of one celebrity he met before he became famous.
In 1959 he paid a young artist $ 400 to paint a bathroom in his apartment. The resulting paint job included a tree, cherries, butterflies and two cats, one on the toilet seat. The painter was Andy Warhol.
A few years later, by then well known, Warhol was more than accommodating when Mr. Heyman asked to photograph him for the "Pop Art" book. But Mr. Heyman moved out of the apartment building without ever capturing the Warholian bathroom on film, and the building later burned down.
Mr. Heyman's marriages to Wendy Drew and Brenda Redmond ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. McCarthy, from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Judith Raboy, whom he married in 1998; another daughter from his first marriage, Amanda Silverman; three sons from his first marriage, Tim, Chris and Jason; two stepdaughters, Sara Raboy Hanley and Amanda Raboy Lewis; and 16 grandchildren.
Mr. Heyman frequently taught or spoke to classes, including in elementary schools. He would sometimes pose a question to schoolchildren: If you had a third eye, where would you put it? It was a question that, he thought, had a correct answer.
"Most of them said in the middle of the forehead and that sort of thing," he recounted in the 2012 video interview. "But the answer is, in the middle of the palm of your hand. Because you could look underneath things, you could look behind you."
Photograph Ken Heyman, bottom right, was sent on assignment to Peru, left, in 1965 to document adult education for the U.S. Information Agency. "The Rail Splitter," above, taken in a lumber yard in Lagos, Nigeria, in the 1960s, was one of his most famous photos.; Mr. Heyman photographed the anthropologist Margaret Mead in the village of Byun Gede, Bali, in 1954, and Anthony Quinn in Italy during filming of "The Secret of Santa Vittoria" in the late 1960s.

Texto completo: In declining to say when she might send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she might keep them as leverage for negotiations on the rules for a trial.
WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated Wednesday night that the House could indefinitely delay sending the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, leaving ambiguous the timing of a trial to decide whether to acquit him or convict and remove him from office.
After historic nearly party-line votes to impeach Mr. Trump for two articles, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she would hold the articles back until it was clearer that the upper chamber would give the case a fair hearing. The strategy suggested she was keeping the charges as leverage in a coming negotiation over the terms of a Senate trial.
But it could leave the matter in limbo until early January, delaying the start of a trial for an unknown period of time.
"We will make our decision as to when we are going to send it when we see what they are doing on the Senate side," Ms. Pelosi said. "So far, we have not seen anything that looks fair to us."
The decision injected a new element of uncertainty into an impeachment process that has already roiled the Capitol and promises profound political implications for Mr. Trump, his party and the Democrats.
With Mr. Trump and his allies said to be interested in a speedy trial and acquittal, Ms. Pelosi believes slowing down the proceeding could force Senate Republicans to set procedures the Democrats find more favorable to their case, according to Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
But it is not at all clear that Ms. Pelosi holds much leverage over Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who as majority leader has broad power to determine the contours of the trial. An adviser to Mr. McConnell, Josh Holmes, signaled the majority leader was in no rush to try the president for impeachable offenses, writing on Twitter that the maneuver "might be the greatest compliment McConnell has ever received."
"They are seriously entertaining holding a grenade with the pin pulled rather than facing what happens when they send it over McConnell's wall," Mr. Holmes said.
Democrats in the Senate had already complained that Mr. McConnell was trying to ram through the president's acquittal by refusing to call witnesses or obtain new evidence. They also took issue with Mr. McConnell's assertions that it was not his role to act as an "impartial juror" during a trial and that he would closely coordinate any trial with the White House Counsel's Office.
"This is what I don't consider a fair trial," Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday.
Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, said he had spoken to at least 40 Democrats who were concerned that Mr. McConnell would not conduct a fair trial, and who wanted Ms. Pelosi to delay sending the articles to the Senate until she learned more about how the proceedings would move forward.
"What is gained by accelerating this process?" he asked. He said Democrats should "let the speaker work her magic" to "get some sort of assurance, if it's possible, that there will be a level playing field."
In addition, some Democrats -- including some of the chamber's most progressive lawmakers -- have advocated simply never sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, to deny Mr. Trump an almost certain acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber, where a two-thirds vote -- 67 senators -- are needed to convict. Ms. Pelosi has not ruled that out, but House leaders are not seriously contemplating that course, the Democratic officials said.
The Constitution does not dictate how the process of transmitting articles of impeachment from the House to the Senate should work. It says only that the House has "the sole power of impeachment" and that the Senate, "shall have the sole power to try all impeachments."
But Ms. Pelosi's hesitation departs from the precedent set by the only modern presidential impeachment.
In December 1998, a group of Republicans immediately marched the articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton across the Capitol to the Senate after the House vote almost exactly 21 years ago. Because the Senate was not in session, the trial did not begin until early January.
The speaker indicated she would also wait to appoint impeachment managers, the House members responsible for prosecuting the case in the Senate, until the matter was resolved.
"We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side, and I would hope that would be soon" Ms. Pelosi said.
Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he did not expect Ms. Pelosi to hold onto the articles indefinitely. But he said Mr. McConnell's close coordination with the White House "makes a mockery of the trial."
"I think everyone needs to be assured that there is a process in place that will treat these very serious impeachment articles with the gravity they deserve," he said.
Still, if there is no resolution on Thursday, a stalemate could easily drag on for weeks.
Under the rules adopted to consider the articles on Wednesday, the House must hold a separate vote allowing Ms. Pelosi to appoint the impeachment managers and transmit the articles to the Senate. The House is scheduled to leave Washington at the end of the week for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, meaning if she does not take the action by then, the fate of the articles could be left unresolved until early January, when Congress reconvenes in the capital.

Texto completo: It was, all in all, a fine week for Donald Trump.
Sure, he’s getting impeached. And he is agitated about that, judging by his fandango of self-pitying tweets. And he did lose out to a 16-year-old girl for Time’s Person of the Year, which made him so jealous he couldn’t resist mocking her, amplifying just how big a loser he is.
But on a scale of one to prison, last week wasn’t a bad week. His disheveled pal, Boris Johnson, won in a landslide over an unappetizing liberal, which many took as a good harbinger for Trump in 2020.
On the Hill, the party of Faust stuck together and vociferously defended their Apollyon.
Even as Democrats declaimed that their hearings were momentous, many deemed them monotonous. The evening news broadcasts demoted impeachment to their No. 4 story and no one seemed to move a scintilla in either direction.
Trump is pretending that his pressure on Ukraine’s president was about fighting corruption when we all know that he fosters corruption. He sins in the saintliest areas. It was just announced that he had to pay $2 million to eight charities after admitting that he diverted funds from his foundation to his campaign and to cover business debts.
The left keens that the president is destroying our sacred institutions and jeopardizing our national security. But for many Americans, last week’s events prove that Trump is right to be cynical about a rigged system and deep-state elites.
The inspector general’s report about the FBI’s Russia investigation offered a hideous Dorian Gray portrait of the once-vaunted law enforcement agency. As Charlie Savage wrote in The Times, the report uncovered “a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process.” The FBI run by Comey and McCabe was sloppy, deceitful and cherry-picking — relying on nonsense spread by Christopher Steele.
With the stunning and sad “Afghanistan Papers,” The Washington Post revealed what we knew in our hearts: We have spent 18 years and a trillion dollars in Afghanistan, with generals lying and hiding evidence that the war was unwinnable, just as the generals did in Vietnam. As one general conceded, they did not understand Afghanistan and didn’t have “the foggiest notion” of what they were doing.
Then there’s “The Report,” streaming on Amazon, the heroic saga of Daniel Jones, played by Adam Driver. Jones is working for Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Intelligence Committee and spends years compiling a report documenting the CIA’s use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in secret prisons, a barbaric, un-American and ineffective system designed by two creepy psychologists who were paid about $81 million by the CIA.
If this weren’t enough institutional perfidy for one week, we had the Boeing hearing in Congress: An FAA analysis done after the first deadly crash off the coast of Indonesia showed that the agency knew that if it did not act, the Boeing 737 Max was likely to crash 15 times in the 45 years it was expected to fly, theoretically killing more than 2,900 people. But that wasn’t enough to immediately ground it. The government is supposed to protect us from the greedy capitalists, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, this climate of confusion and cynicism allows Trump to prosper. He did not come to Washington to clean up the tainted system; he came to bathe in it.

Texto completo: ’Twas the eve of impeachment, when all through the House
No Republicans wavered, each last one a louse.
The articles were drafted by Democrats with care
In hopes that a conscience would soon bloom there.
We pundits were tossing all steamed in our beds,
While Trump’s certain acquittal danced in our heads.
And I in frustration, feeling all solemn,
Wished I could capture my woe in a column,
When out on the web there arose such a clatter,
I signed in to Twitter to see what was the matter.
And there I beheld him, the master of lies,
Weaving fresh falsehoods, to no one’s surprise.
He savaged the Bidens, he smeared Adam Schiff,
And cycled through villains in a furious jiff,
Not to mention distractions, like the teeth of the Speaker
Could a “leader” be cruder, could his morals be weaker?
So now he’s a dentist, in his all-knowing ways?
I prayed for deliverance one of these days.
When what to my cynical eyes did appear
But a raft of excuses pulled by mangy reindeer,
With a weasel-eyed driver, so meek and so zany,
I knew in a moment he must be Mulvaney.
More shameless than con men, the sycophants came,
And Trump gloated, so bloated, and called them by name:
“Now, Rudy! Now, Jared! Now, Lindsey and Mitch!
Please fly this democracy into a ditch!
It is how you will save me. It is how I prevail.
Or else I will join poor Paul in the jail.
That’s the toll of a presidency ended too soon,
So you must sing along to my favorite tune:
‘It’s a witch hunt! A hoax!’ Those are lyrics for me.
That’s the verse, that’s the chorus, for eternity.”
He was dressed in a necktie, from his jowls to his soles.
He had tanned beyond tanning. Imagine the moles.
His hair, how it swirled! His legs, how they splayed!
On such fishy foundations was his confidence laid.
And we couldn’t stop looking — not his fans, not his foes.
That was what he was after: the show of all shows.
Its plot strained belief. Its appeal tested reason.
Still it was soaring toward a second season.
The economy roared. The Democrats whimpered.
Vladimir chortled. Emmanuel simpered.
In the bag that Trump carried, he had goodies galore:
Lower taxes, the Dow, right-wing judges and more.
They weren’t for the many, they favored the few,
But that was obscured by the smoke that he blew.
All was fog, all was mist, all was boast, all was fiction,
As he hid his true airs with bad diet and diction.
He could do as he wanted and never know fear,
For an elf — and a savior! — named Barr hovered near.
And then there was Tucker and of course Hannity
To put an extra-fine gloss on insanity.
What great luck to discover a country so riven
You could smash it and rule it if suitably driven.
You could summon the Russians, you could bully Ukraine,
Just as long as you made “It’s fake news!” your refrain.
I cringed as I watched him and cried for us all,
Our values, our futures hijacked by his gall.
A last bid to preserve them was cause to impeach
But his party’s corruption put him beyond reach.
So then why all his thrashing? His howls of dejection?
It was just a performance for the next election.
It brought more donations. It rallied the base.
You could see, if you looked, a clear smirk on his face.
If you listened, you heard it: a lilt in his voice.
In drama like this, he would always rejoice.
So as history scarred him, he could nonetheless yell,
“Merry TrumpMas to all! I’m the king of this hell.”

Texto completo: Chuck Jones's much-loved 1966 animated version of Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" will be telecast for the umpteenth time by NBC on Christmas night. The narrator is Boris Karloff, whose speaking voice (he sounded like a kindly Edwardian uncle) will be familiar to anyone who's seen "Grinch," though he was far better known in his own day for having played the heavily made-up monster in James Whale's 1931 screen adaptation of "Frankenstein," the movie that made him a full-fledged star. Julie Harris, who later appeared opposite Karloff on Broadway and TV, called him "a great actor....He had an enormous warmth and humanity, and this fascinating darker quality. It was mysterious. You wanted to know where such a man came from." But unless you've seen "Frankenstein," it's possible that you won't recognize his name—and you certainly won't know that there was far more to him than the monsters and madmen he played on screen.
Karloff made his professional stage debut in 1910, spending a decade acting in traveling stock companies before moving to Hollywood, where he became a highly admired character actor. His early sound-film performances include striking supporting parts in two fine pre-Code movies, appearing opposite Edward G. Robinson as a drunken, unscrupulous newspaperman in Mervyn LeRoy's "Five Star Final" (1931) and playing a religious fanatic in John Ford's "The Lost Patrol" (1934).
As a result of the success of "Frankenstein," alas, he was permanently typecast, and spent the rest of his life appearing in horror films that were mostly of indifferent quality (remember "Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"?). A few of them, fortunately—above all "The Body Snatcher" (1945) and "Bedlam" (1946), both produced by Val Lewton, and "Targets" (1968), Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film—were more than good enough to suggest how sensitive an actor he was beneath the bogeyman makeup that he often wore on screen. He was also highly literate: Joseph Conrad was his favorite novelist, and Mr. Bogdanovich praised his "intelligence and taste that came across on a very high level."
Karloff's first real opportunity to show his stuff came when, in 1941, he returned to the stage after a long absence—in a comedy. He made his Broadway debut in the original production of "Arsenic and Old Lace," Joseph Kesselring's now-classic black farce, which ran for 1,444 performances. In it, he created the role of Jonathan Brewster, a psychopathic mass murderer whose life is ruined when an alcoholic plastic surgeon inadvertently makes him look like—yes—Boris Karloff.
At first he was terrified by the thought of acting in front of live audiences after having spent so long in Hollywood. A month after the show opened, he recalled, "I got on the scales and I had lost 26 pounds—in sheer fright." But to everyone's amazement, his own included, he turned out to have a knack for comedy, and the rave reviews that he received for "Arsenic" inspired him to continue performing in plays as a more artistically fulfilling sideline.
On top of all this, Karloff even managed to make the transition to the small screen at the dawn of network television. Fortunately for posterity, he appeared in numerous live-TV dramas, some of which were small-screen versions of the plays in which he starred on Broadway. Several of these telecasts were preserved on kinescope and can be viewed on YouTube. They include an excellent 1962 "Hallmark Hall of Fame" version of "Arsenic" in which he shares top billing with Tony Randall—it's far better than Frank Capra's grossly overacted 1944 film version, in which he was replaced by Raymond Massey—and an uneven but interesting 1958 "Playhouse 90" adaptation of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" in which he is startlingly vivid as Mr. Kurtz, uttering the line "Exterminate all the brutes!" with shocking conviction.
Best of all is another "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special, this one based on the original Broadway production of a play of real substance. "The Lark," telecast in 1957, was Lillian Hellman's English-language stage adaptation of "L'Alouette," Jean Anouilh's 1952 retelling of the story of Joan of Arc, who was played on both Broadway and TV by Julie Harris. Karloff, cast as the bishop who reluctantly sentenced her to death, once again received glowing reviews for his performance, which Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times praised as "paternal, sorrowful, pleading."
Years later, Harris told Scott Allen Nollen, Karloff's biographer, that working with him in "The Lark" had been "a dream….He would have been great in any play." How remarkable that so heartfelt a tribute should have been paid to Boris Karloff by one of the greatest American stage actors of her generation! Yet to view the TV version of "The Lark" today, even on a faded kinescope, is to be left in no doubt of Karloff's own formidable powers as a stage performer, as well as his ability to grapple with a role of near-classical scope. Not too shabby for a movie monster.

Texto completo: Abortion access is facing a monumental crisis, as states across the nation continue to advance and enact restrictive abortion laws, the Trump administration puts in place reproductive health policies that ignore science, and the Supreme Court is set to decide a major case on abortion regulations next year.
Amid this treacherous landscape, two key factors will help determine the future of abortion in the United States: the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, and the outcome of ongoing efforts to make medication abortion (also called the abortion pill) easier for people to get.
So far, the Democratic presidential candidates have not engaged in a robust conversation about their views on the crucial issue of expanding access to medication abortion. But they should. And fortunately, that is starting to change.
Just last month, the Democratic presidential candidates responded to a New York Times survey about their positions on abortion, including a question about whether they would make mifepristone and misoprostol — the two pills used in medication abortion —available over the counter. Seven candidates said they supported OTC medication abortion, two were unsure and seven didn’t answer the question.
Growing crisis of abortion access
While there has been public discussion about OTC access to birth control pills, there has been little buzz about making abortion pills available without a prescription. The public response to the survey results has ranged from concern about abortion pills being sold like aspirin, to relief that this could ease the growing crisis of abortion access.
Six states have only one abortion clinic left, and some states could soon have none, depending on how the Supreme Court rules in the Louisiana case it has accepted.
I’ve been doing research related to OTC access to medication abortion for several years, both in the United States and abroad, and the reality is that this is not an immediate panacea. More studies are needed, and it is likely several years before the Food and Drug Administration will review an application to make abortion pills available without a prescription.
Even so, it’s an important step that the Democratic candidates were even asked about this policy change, which has the potential to radically transform how people access and experience abortion care.
Research increasingly indicates that people are interested in OTC access to abortion pills. In a 2017 survey we conducted of over 7,000 U. S. women ages 18-49 about their interest in obtaining abortion pills over the counter, 37% said they supported OTC access to abortion pills. They often cited advantages related to convenience and how it would facilitate access to care earlier in pregnancy. In another survey we did of abortion patients in states with limited access to the service, 80% said they supported OTC availability.
As a practicing OB-GYN, I have few concerns about the safety of making medication abortion available without a prescription or clinical evaluation. This treatment is simple and involves taking the two medications, usually 24 hours apart, which leads to cramping, bleeding and expulsion of the pregnancy.
Most of the eligibility assessment for the abortion pill involves a simple list of questions that patients themselves could easily complete. For example, we ask patients whether they have an intrauterine device in place, because it needs to be removed before using abortion pills, and we ask whether they’re taking blood thinners, which can increase bleeding.
Research shows these pills are safe
Currently, medication abortion is FDA-approved for use up through 10 weeks of pregnancy; after this point, the drug regimen changes. If abortion pills were available without a prescription, one question is whether patients could accurately self-assess their gestational age, and another is whether they might choose to use the pills beyond 10 weeks because they had limited alternatives. We are conducting a study of the accuracy of gestational age self-assessment, which will help answer at least the first question.
In many parts of the world, people already have access to abortion pills without a prescription. In most of Latin America, where abortion is largely restricted, misoprostol is often available in pharmacies without a prescription — and its expanded access has been associated with a reduction in deaths and complications from unsafe abortion.
Research from Peru and Bangladesh suggests that women can safely and effectively use abortion pills they obtain without a prescription.
Our research shows: Abortion laws are not based on facts and can even harm women
Of course, over-the-counter abortion pills are not the answer for everyone. Many patients appreciate the support they receive from clinicians and clinic staff. The future of patient-centered abortion care must include a range of options, including facility-based services.
As in other countries, there are an increasing number of reports about U. S. women accessing abortion pills without a prescription, including through online sources, which the FDA claims is illegal.
At least 21 people have been arrested or criminally investigated for allegedly attempting to self-induce their abortion or for helping someone else, and women of color have been disproportionately targeted for criminalization.
Make abortion pills easier to get now
An FDA move toward approving OTC abortion pills would help decriminalize and destigmatize self-managed abortion. But first, in order for the FDA to approve medication abortion for over-the-counter sale, a pharmaceutical company would need to perform specific research showing that women can safely and effectively use the product without medical supervision. That would take at least three to five years, assuming the studies go well and there is no political interference in the FDA approval process.
Out of step: Trump's new Title X plan requires ineffective birth control most women don't want
That timeline is too long to make a difference for people living in the South and Midwest who are facing an immediate and potentially worsening crisis of abortion access. But there are steps policymakers could take now to improve access to the abortion pill and help people obtain safe care early in pregnancy: lifting medically unnecessary regulations that prohibit doctors from prescribing the pill for dispensing at a pharmacy, lifting restrictions in almost 20 states on telemedicine (which research shows is safe and effective for medication abortion), and allowing nurse practitioners and other advanced practice clinicians to provide the abortion pill (fewer than 20 states do now, though outcomes are similar).
As more abortion patients seek out online options for self-managed care, it’s time to meet their needs with services like over-the-counter access to medication abortion. This is the future of reproductive health care, and we must continue to ask politicians, including those currently seeking the presidency, about how they plan to make it a reality.

Upward Mobility: The Democrats Could Re-Elect Trump in 2020

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, who prides himself on being one of President Trump's leading Democratic tormentors, argued last week that the president must be impeached pronto so that he doesn't "cheat in one more election." I know Democrats are eager to expand the scope of impeachable behavior, but since when do we impeach presidents based on what they might do in the future?
Mr. Schiff ought to reacquaint himself with special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress earlier this year. Mr. Mueller stated that his investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities." But Democrats who are panicking over the prospect of Mr. Trump's winning a second term should be at least as concerned with the mainstream media's behavior as they are with Russia's.
Mr. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as a surprise to so many people because journalists consistently played down his chances of winning. Thinking Mrs. Clinton was a shoo-in, many Democrats stayed home on Election Day. Much has been written about the millions of voters who switched from supporting Barack Obama to backing Mr. Trump in important battleground states like Iowa and Wisconsin. But Democratic nonvoters, who either couldn't stomach pulling the lever for Mrs. Clinton or didn't think she needed their support to prevail -- were also a decisive factor. In Michigan, for example, Mrs. Clinton received 300,000 fewer votes than Mr. Obama did in 2012, and Mr. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes.
The media continues to harp on Mr. Trump's unpopularity, which is news but needs context and is hardly a reason for Democrats to be complacent. Despite low unemployment, rising wages and relatively strong economic growth, the president's job-approval rating has remained in the 40s. This could be a problem for the incumbent next year, particularly if the economy goes into recession, but it's not an insurmountable obstacle. President Obama was also polling in the low to mid-40s in December 2011 and went on to be re-elected in 2012.
The press is also inadvertently helping Mr. Trump by giving the most favorable coverage to the most liberal Democratic candidates running to replace him. The president's strategy has been to paint the other party as too extreme to trust with the White House. Joe Biden has led the Democratic nomination race in national polling from the moment he announced his candidacy. But he is not the preferred candidate of the Washington media elites, as their coverage of him thus far makes clear. Progressive proposals to end private health insurance and decriminalize illegal immigration get far more and far better press coverage than Mr. Biden's alternatives. If the Democrats do go ahead and nominate a progressive who loses to Mr. Trump, the media can share the blame.
As Mr. Schiff's remark suggests, many Democrats in Congress have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate president. Speaker Nancy Pelosi understood that the case for impeachment was weak, overly partisan and doomed to fail in the Senate. She moved ahead anyway to placate the progressives in her caucus who share Mr. Schiff's sentiment. And she now wants it over as soon as possible to placate more-moderate Democrats from districts Mr. Trump carried, who want to spend next year campaigning on other issues.
The irony for Democrats is that fallout from their overzealous get-Trump offensive could strengthen the president's argument for a second term. He is a disrupter, if nothing else, and after the revelations contained in the Justice Department inspector general's report, who can argue that some disruption wasn't in order? "At more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever at the government's secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil," wrote Charlie Savage in the New York Times. "And what the report showed was not pretty."
What the report showed was that FBI officials deceived a court into obtaining warrants to wiretap Carter Page, a U.S. citizen and former Trump adviser, during the 2016 campaign. It also showed that a discredited "dossier" compiled at the request of Democratic operatives was "central and essential" to the FBI's warrant application, something the anti-Trump media had long disputed. In a hapless effort to demonstrate that Mr. Page was working for the Russians, the agency manipulated documents and hid information that could have exonerated him.
Democrats are playing down these findings because, however badly the FBI behaved, it was in the service of taking down Mr. Trump. But voters might see things differently, and I don't suspect that the president will stop talking about how his opponents in the government and the media have spent the past three years using lies and deception to portray him as a White House squatter.

Colombia exhuming graves of alleged victims of soldiers

Texto completo: Colombian authorities are exhuming dozens of graves to determine whether the dead were civilians who security forces falsely claimed were guerrillas.
Authorities say soldiers killed thousands of civilians between 1998 and 2014 under pressure from their commanders and then claimed the victims were members of the FARC guerrilla group. They planted weapons on their victims and dressed them in fighters' uniforms in a scandal Colombians have dubbed Falsos Positivos , or 'False Positives.'
The pace of killing increased from 2005 to 2009 under President Álvaro Uribe, who led an offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The country's Special Peace Tribunal, created under the 2016 peace accords that ended Colombia's 50-year conflict, announced Saturday it had begun the exhumation of more than 50 bodies, the largest such operation to date.
The work began last week at the Catholic Cemetery of Las Mercedes in Dabeiba, a town in the northwestern department of Antioquia, the tribunal said in a statement. It came after the panel heard 'a series of voluntary testimonies,' including one from a former soldier who said he knew of false positives in the town.
The soldier, who was in custody, accompanied authorities to the cemetery, located on a small mountain shrouded in fog, a human rights activist who was at the scene told The Washington Post. He spoke for an hour about his role in covering up civilian deaths.
Activist Adriana Arboleda, who represents victims through the local Legal Freedom Corporation, called the exhumation 'an important step.'
'The tribunal is proving that it's bringing to light cases that had been and would have remained unpunished,' she said. 'It offers hope that the country will be able to know the truth and recover bodies. Things that victims' families have long yearned for.'
The tribunal said the first seven bodies of the more than 50 victims believed to be buried in the cemetery had been recovered. Most victims were between 15 and 56 years old, the panel said; some were disabled.
Colombia's main cities have been beset in recent weeks by mass demonstrations against the government of President Iván Duque " in part, protesters say, because he has failed to fully implement the peace accords signed by his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos. Duque is a member of Uribe's Democratic Center Party.
Dozens of demobilized FARC members, including some who participated in the peace negotiations, have retaken arms and returned to the jungle to resume the fight. More than 700 activists, indigenous leaders and demobilized FARC guerrillas have been killed since 2016.
Guillermo Botero, Duque's defense minister, resigned in November after evidence emerged that children had died in operations against dissident FARC groups. The New York Times reported in May that military commanders had ordered troops to kill more criminals and militants, suggesting they would accept more collateral damage.
The exhumations had been long awaited by victims of the armed conflict as a next step beyond taking testimony.
Dozens of soldiers have appeared before the tribunal since 2016 to be judged under transitional justice, which offers them reduced punishment if they collaborate. Investigations into false positives started last year.
'We have talked to more than one hundred military men,' Alejandro Ramelli, a tribunal magistrate, told the national newspaper El Espectador. 'They have revealed to us dozens of incidents, but we now have to confirm that what they are saying is true.'
The testimony of more than 160 soldiers has helped authorities identify some 400 victims to date, the tribunal said Saturday.

Texto completo: One of Rudy Giuliani's pals accused of campaign finance crimes and implicated in President Trump's effort to dig up Ukrainian dirt on Joe Biden can't go back to the country due to "threats," according to his attorney.
The attorney, Joseph Bondy, slipped the claim into a Monday letter pushing back against accusations from federal prosecutors that Lev Parnas (inset) poses a flight risk and should be locked up pending trial.
"[Parnas] cannot flee to Ukraine, where he has been the subject of threats since even prior to his arrest," Bondy wrote.
The nature of the threats were not explained in Bondy's letter, but the attorney suggested in a text message that a notorious Ukrainian oligarch could be responsible.
"Remember Rudy's tweet," Bondy texted along with a link to a May 18 tweet from the ex-mayor saying billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky had "returned to Ukraine from exile in Israel and the first thing he did is threaten American citizens."
Bondy did not respond to follow-up questions.
Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's wealthiest men, is reportedly under FBI investigation over alleged money laundering.
Giuliani unsuccessfully pressured Kolomoisky into arranging a meeting with the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, according to The New York Times.

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, who prides himself on being one of President Trump's leading Democratic tormentors, argued last week that the president must be impeached pronto so that he doesn't "cheat in one more election." I know Democrats are eager to expand the scope of impeachable behavior, but since when do we impeach presidents based on what they might do in the future?
Mr. Schiff ought to reacquaint himself with special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress earlier this year. Mr. Mueller stated that his investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities." But Democrats who are panicking over the prospect of Mr. Trump's winning a second term should be at least as concerned with the mainstream media's behavior as they are with Russia's.
Mr. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as a surprise to so many people because journalists consistently played down his chances of winning. Thinking Mrs. Clinton was a shoo-in, many Democrats stayed home on Election Day. Much has been written about the millions of voters who switched from supporting Barack Obama to backing Mr. Trump in important battleground states like Iowa and Wisconsin. But Democratic nonvoters, who either couldn't stomach pulling the lever for Mrs. Clinton or didn't think she needed their support to prevail—were also a decisive factor. In Michigan, for example, Mrs. Clinton received 300,000 fewer votes than Mr. Obama did in 2012, and Mr. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes.
The media continues to harp on Mr. Trump's unpopularity, which is news but needs context and is hardly a reason for Democrats to be complacent. Despite low unemployment, rising wages and relatively strong economic growth, the president's job-approval rating has remained in the 40s. This could be a problem for the incumbent next year, particularly if the economy goes into recession, but it's not an insurmountable obstacle. President Obama was also polling in the low to mid-40s in December 2011 and went on to be re-elected in 2012.
The press is also inadvertently helping Mr. Trump by giving the most favorable coverage to the most liberal Democratic candidates running to replace him. The president's strategy has been to paint the other party as too extreme to trust with the White House. Joe Biden has led the Democratic nomination race in national polling from the moment he announced his candidacy. But he is not the preferred candidate of the Washington media elites, as their coverage of him thus far makes clear. Progressive proposals to end private health insurance and decriminalize illegal immigration get far more and far better press coverage than Mr. Biden's alternatives. If the Democrats do go ahead and nominate a progressive who loses to Mr. Trump, the media can share the blame.
As Mr. Schiff's remark suggests, many Democrats in Congress have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate president. Speaker Nancy Pelosi understood that the case for impeachment was weak, overly partisan and doomed to fail in the Senate. She moved ahead anyway to placate the progressives in her caucus who share Mr. Schiff's sentiment. And she now wants it over as soon as possible to placate more-moderate Democrats from districts Mr. Trump carried, who want to spend next year campaigning on other issues.
The irony for Democrats is that fallout from their overzealous get-Trump offensive could strengthen the president's argument for a second term. He is a disrupter, if nothing else, and after the revelations contained in the Justice Department inspector general's report, who can argue that some disruption wasn't in order? "At more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever at the government's secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil," wrote Charlie Savage in the New York Times. "And what the report showed was not pretty."
What the report showed was that FBI officials deceived a court into obtaining warrants to wiretap Carter Page, a U.S. citizen and former Trump adviser, during the 2016 campaign. It also showed that a discredited "dossier" compiled at the request of Democratic operatives was "central and essential" to the FBI's warrant application, something the anti-Trump media had long disputed. In a hapless effort to demonstrate that Mr. Page was working for the Russians, the agency manipulated documents and hid information that could have exonerated him.
Democrats are playing down these findings because, however badly the FBI behaved, it was in the service of taking down Mr. Trump. But voters might see things differently, and I don't suspect that the president will stop talking about how his opponents in the government and the media have spent the past three years using lies and deception to portray him as a White House squatter.

Resumen: The galaxy's media elite are weighing in on director J.J. Abrams' "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" after the world premiere Monday night.

Texto completo: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" has been unveiled following the world premiere in Hollywood Monday night, with members of the media weighing in on social media, spoiler free, ahead of Wednesday's 12:01 a. m. EST review embargo.
The results were a mixed emotional bag from journalists for the J. J. Abrams-directed film which ends the Skywalker saga and opens in theaters Thursday.
USA TODAY's critic Brian Truitt noted that "Rise of Skywalker" was, "Not the best #StarWars but one with great new characters, cool twists and a fantastic group dynamic. "
"TheRiseofSkywalker definitely tries to wrap up nine movies - a LOT happens - and does so in often funny, sometimes surprising, emotional and bombastic fashion. "
There was much discussion on social media stating that 2017's Rian Johnson's "The Last Jedi" took hits from Abrams in the new movie.
"Rise of Skywalker could only have been ruder to Rian Johnson if they had motion-smoothed it," wrote the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan in a tweet that was retweeted and discussed consistently.
'I'm 92% terrified': Director J. J. Abrams unveils 'Star Wars': The Rise of Skywalker'
Germain Lussier, entertainment reporter for Gizmodo, retweeted Buchanan's "Last Jedi" note, calling it "1000% true. "
Lussier added of the movie, "I loved parts, I didn’t love others, and I’m leaving the theater very, very conflicted about it. "
Mike Ryan of Uproxx called it "the most convoluted Star Wars. "
"There is a lot I liked, but the first half gets so bogged down with exposition and new plot and doodads and beacons and transmitters, it feels like it should have been three movies on its own," he wrote. "The whole first half felt like all exposition. It does get better. "
Cinemablend editor Eric Eisenberg wrote that, "There is good in 'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker. ' But there is more that is disappointing. "
"I'm bummed," he added.
Terri Schwarz of entertainment site IGN tweeted that she is "still processing" adding that "a couple things I didn’t like sour the movie for me. "
Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair summed up his tweet of the movie with, "I absolutely loved it. "
Erik Davis, managing editor of the ticket site Fandango. com, called the film, "Epic. All of it. "
"#TheRiseofSkywalker is a terrific finale that is just stuffed with so much of everything," he wrote. "I spent the entire second half with tears in my eyes - a wonderful way to end the Skywalker story. "

Texto completo: Within the next few weeks, every member of the House and Senate will make a public declaration of their judgment of President Donald Trump's misdeeds. While each has their own beliefs and their own incentives, the politics of impeachment are much simpler than you might think.
There are no double bank shots to be played, no mass public conversions that can be engineered and no clever stratagem that will transform the outcome of this process. Which ought to be liberating, at least for most members of Congress.
Let's start with the state of overall opinion. Before the impeachment inquiry began, Democrats hoped it would turn the public more against Trump than they already were, and Republicans hoped there would be a backlash from their own voters. What we saw instead was something simple. As FiveThirtyEight's tracking shows, before the Ukraine scandal broke, around 38-40% of Americans thought Trump should be impeached, and around 50-53% thought he shouldn't.
But since the scandal broke, around 48% think he should be impeached and around 43-45% say he shouldn't. Any given poll may produce a slightly different result, but that's the general pattern.
If you're a member of Congress, the national picture doesn't matter nearly as much as what your own constituents think. But whether you're in a swing district or one that votes overwhelmingly for your party, your calculation is essentially the same: If you go against what your party believes, you're basically doomed in the next election.
Which you can see in the strange case of Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., the exception that proves the rule. Van Drew opposes impeachment, which is apparently a belief he holds sincerely and strongly enough to sacrifice his political career over it. Though Van Drew was elected last year to represent a district Trump won narrowly in 2016, the New York Times reported that he recently saw a poll showing that "the overwhelming majority of Democratic primary voters - 71% - would be less likely to support his re-election if he opposed the charges against Mr. Trump."
Voting against impeachment would have gotten Van Drew a primary challenge that he'd likely lose. So he took another path: He'll be switching parties, and come next year, he'll be challenged in the primary by a genuine Republican and probably lose.
Contrast that with Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who also represents a district Trump won in 2016. Rather than try to save herself with some complicated switcheroo in a vain attempt to win over Republicans in her district, Slotkin decided to vote yes on the two articles of impeachment and is now explaining to her constituents why she made that decision.
These Democrats likely understand that swing districts aren't made up of moderate voters, they're made up of roughly equal numbers of partisan Republicans and partisan Democrats. Whichever party you're in, voting for the other side won't get you much credit with them, but it will destroy your support among your own partisans.
Which means that the best thing for Democrats in swing districts (and states) isn't finding some kind of middle way. It's making sure that Trump is as discredited and damaged as possible.
We can't be sure about how this will affect next year's presidential election, since no president has run after being impeached. But in all likelihood it will follow the simple pattern we're seeing so far. Democratic and Republican voters are both energized by it, which will contribute to an election likely to have extremely high turnout.
So where does that leave us? Impeachment was always the right thing to do substantively, because Trump's misconduct was so clear and egregious. And it's the right thing to do politically, because it builds up the case about Trump's corruption even if it doesn't result in his removal. Everything else is details.

Protect your packages coming during the holidays

Texto completo: AKRON — With holiday packages arriving by mail and delivery services, the Better Business Bureau of Akron has issued a good warning — be careful of porch pirates who steal packages.
According to a survey commissioned by Comcast and conducted by Wakefield Research, nearly one in four people report being a victim of package theft and nearly half know someone who has had a package stolen.
The data is even higher among millennials, the BBB reports, with one in three having had a package stolen and nearly 60 percent knowing someone who has been a victim.
Here are some tips:
• Have packages delivered to work or a family member who is normally home.
• Communicate with delivery drivers to place packages out of sight.
• Install a smart doorbell to monitor activity.
• Request a signature for delivery.
• Consider security cameras.
• Request to pick up your packages in person or at a locker if the retailer offers this option.
• Network with neighbors to watch out for packages.
What if you suspect your package was stolen?
Be sure to conduct a thorough search. Consumers have reported that Amazon Prime deliveries are often found on their back porch. Amazon sometimes takes pictures after a delivery. The website says: “Capturing delivery photos is intended to help customers see that their package was safely delivered and where. The photo will focus on the placement of the package.”
If your package is missing, communicate with your seller and carrier. Try having your package tracked from the start.
Local police departments recommend filing a police report as well. Without a witness or video, it could prove difficult for the police to investigate, but if there are several reports from your neighborhood, police may begin targeted patrols to watch out for thieves in your area.
Who is Jenny B?
Speaking of packages or mail, a pink greeting card envelope hand-addressed to Erin Armschlinger arrived in the mail about a month ago.
The return label looked like it was smudged and had fallen off.
“Since it looked hand-written, I thought maybe it’s somebody I know,” Armschlinger said.
It was a greeting card that had a cartoon picture of an avocado on it and the words “Holy Guacamole! You’re going to avo baby!”
“That’s news to me because I’m definitely not pregnant and have not been pregnant,” said Armschlinger, 27, who ironically designs cards for a greeting-card company.
She opened the card and saw a message that said something like “I hope you like these,” signed with a heart and just “Jenny B.”
“Originally I thought it was addressed to the wrong person.”
Inside the card were a couple of gift cards for such things as a pregnancy pillow, clothing and baby items. They totaled about $245.
“I was trying to run through my head ‘Do I even know a Jenny B?’ I know a Jenny who has similar handwriting, but I was kind of skeptical,” she said.
“I started Googling the name online.”
She found a thread of discussions with pictures of the same card and gift cards.
Armschlinger is one of many women nationwide who have reported the questionable marketing tactic to area BBBs. Armschlinger, who lives near Cleveland, reported her strange card to the BBB of Akron since a friend works there.
“This type of marketing is very misleading,” said Christy Page, president of the BBB of Akron.
The cards are coming from a Utah-based company called Mother’s Lounge.
The BBB locally has fielded calls about the marketing ploy and the BBB in Utah near the company has more than 70 complaints and reports in BBB ScamTracker. There also have been dozens of negative customer reviews on bbb.org from all across the United States. The company has not responded to any BBB complaints since 2018.
If you receive a similar mailing, read the fine print on both the gift card and their website. Many buyers found additional fees and inflated shipping costs were unexpectedly added to their purchase that they expected to be covered by the “gift card.” Additionally, many consumers reported the products they received were of poor quality and overpriced.
It is unclear if the cards from Jenny B are a scam or just a bad — and potentially insensitive —marketing ploy. Media outlets around the country have tried to reach out to Mother’s Lounge without response. The company did not respond to the Beacon Journal’s request for comment.
A New York Times story about the Jenny B mail included a statement from Scott Anderson, the director of marketing at Mothers Lounge, who called the outreach “heartfelt.”
“The qualified recipients for this mailer have, at one point, subscribed to an opt-in list for maternity deals and coupons through a third party marketing company,” Anderson told the New York Times. “All information from third party companies is only used internally for Mother’s Lounge and is not sold or used for anything else other than the direct marketing of Mother’s Lounge.”
Armschlinger said there’s no reason she ever would have signed up for a pregnancy-related list.
She also doesn’t understand how the company makes money by sending such targeted mailers to consumers who won’t necessarily use it.
“I think it’s just a really misguided marketing tactic,” she said. “It’s also alarming because it’s so invasive. You think somebody you know wrote this letter and it’s going directly to you at your home.
“I consider it pretty shady means. What if somebody had gotten this who had previously miscarried or maybe their daughter isn’t alive. What kind of negative emotions are you going to put this person through just because you’re trying to sell a product?”

THE BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO MAKE PART OF THE TRUMP TAX CUTS PERMANENT TO ADDRESS BIG MEDICAL BILLS: The deadline for Congress to pass its budget and avoid a shutdown is only five days away, and amid talks over drug pricing and surprise billing, there’s another healthcare cost issue that has gotten less attention: The fact that fewer people are set to qualify next year for the medical expense deduction.
As it stands now, about 4.4 million people use the deduction to recoup all kinds of expenses related to their health, whether it be premiums, doctor visits, equipment, or even dental care.
Because of the Republican tax overhaul, for the past two years people have been allowed to deduct their medical expenses if they add up to more than 7.5% of their income, but that threshold is set to expire and jump to 10% during the next tax season unless Congress enacts a change as part of its spending bill due Dec. 20.
Seniors in particular face major medical costs and use the deduction, even though they get coverage from Medicare. According to AARP, 39% of people who took the deduction are over the age of 65. People who have diabetes, cancer, or a disability also are disproportionately hit by high out-of-pocket medical expenses.
Susan Collins, who chairs the aging committee, is among the senators pushing for making the tax break permanent. Back when the bill was being debated, increasing the deduction was one of the ways that Republican leaders were able to get her support.
If Congress reaches an impasse on surprise billing, then making the medical deduction sit permanently at 7.5% could help them demonstrate they are committed to reducing costs for patients.
It’s very possible the Medical Expense Savings Act, which would make the tax break permanent, will be added to the spending bill, but a senior GOP aide told the Washington Examiner that there’s no word yet one way or another. Even though the GOP tax overhaul was partisan, it seems that at least a couple of Democrats think this part of the bill is worth preserving.
Democrats Maria Cantwell of Washington and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona recently joined with Republicans Martha McSally of Arizona and Collins in asking Senate leaders to extend the deduction by passing the bill they all co-sponsored. As the spending bill comes together, we’ve got our eye on this particular measure.

OBAMACARE TAXES GETTING THE AXE IN SPENDING DEAL: Negotiations are still underway, but a senior Democratic congressional aide confirmed that the House spending deal would repeal the Cadillac tax, the health insurance tax, and the medical device tax.
The deal also includes: A prohibition on tobacco sales to anyone under age 21, and passage of the CREATES Act, which goes after a practice brand-name drugmakers use to block generic companies from making cheaper copies.
But there’s another piece Republicans might not like. Democrats want to block potential regulatory actions by the Trump administration that would block people from being able to automatically re-enroll in plans, and that would block insurers from “silver loading,” which charges the government more for premiums to make them cheaper for enrollees. There’s no word whether the Trump administration will be moving forward on those ideas, but they would make health insurance more expensive for people who get subsidies under Obamacare.
HEALTHCARE.GOV FACES PROBLEMS IN ITS LAST DAY: The website typically faces a huge surge of visits because people tend to hold off on signing up, and that left customers facing a slew of technical glitches. Get America Covered, the group run by former Obama administration officials, urged the Trump administration to extend the deadline by two days, but it did come to a close.
As in past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said anyone who provided their information by 3 a.m. Monday to a call center or through the website could still get coverage.
Obama tweeted about open enrollment again. Former President Barack Obama released a gif of himself using a zen garden on Twitter and urged people to sign up for plans that can cost as little as $10 a month. The irony is that one of the reasons more plans cost so little was because President Trump ended direct payments for cost-sharing reduction subsidies, a move Democrats widely decried as “sabotage” but that led insurers to stack their plans differently so they can charge the government more and customers less.
NEW BIPARTISAN BILL TELLS VAPING COMPANIES TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY MADE: Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced a bill to fund a nationwide anti-vaping campaign, and he wants vaping manufacturers to pay for it. Krishnamoorthi’s bill, introduced with GOP congressman Peter King, requires vaping companies pay a quarterly fee to the government, as tobacco companies already do, to collect $200 million per year to be directed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. States would then apply for CDC funding to create their own anti-vaping initiatives.
FEDERAL COURT REAFFIRMS DECISION TO BLOCK MISSISSIPPI ABORTION BAN: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2018 decision to block Mississippi’s 15-week ban on abortions, allowing the state’s sole abortion provider, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, to stay open at least for now.
Friday’s decision is a dress rehearsal for 2020 abortion ban litigation: The court’s decision to strike down the law Friday is the latest in a series of suits arguing against state abortion restrictions, and the wave of suits will continue in 2020. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in March 2020 about a Louisiana abortion restriction in the case June Medical Services v. Gee, the first case SCOTUS will hear on abortion since the confirmations of justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The law mirrors one in Texas that required abortion providers to have hospital admitting priviliges, which the court invalidated 5-3 in 2016.
REPUBLICANS SAY THEIR DRUG PRICING BILL WILL SAVE LIVES, UNLIKE PELOSI’S: GOP healthcare providers-turned-lawmakers wrote in the Washington Examiner that Nancy Pelosi’s Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which the House passed 230-192 last week, would stifle innovation, while their bill would lower prices without harming the creation of new life-saving drugs. “We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones. Lives literally depend on it,” wrote the Republicans, including Buddy Carter of Georgia and John Joyce of Pennsylvania.

We're here, we're queer and we watch the Hallmark Channel's corny Christmas movies, too

Resumen: I'm a sucker for those sappy, unrealistic, woefully undiverse Hallmark Channel Christmas movies. Thankfully, queer couples finally make an appearance.

Texto completo: “Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to error that counts,” wrote poet Nikki Giovanni. She might as well have been writing about the recent mess at the Hallmark Channel, which in the past two months zigzagged from promises to be more inclusive of LGBTQ families on its TV channel (there are none currently), to yanking four commercials featuring two brides (calling them “controversial”), to completely reversing course this weekend and apologizing to Zola, the wedding planner company that had produced the ads. The president and CEO of Hallmark Cards, Inc. , said the earlier action to ban the ads featuring lesbian brides “was the wrong decision. ”
Good for Hallmark. And good for viewers.
I confess: One of my guilty pleasures is watching the Hallmark Channel’s Christmas movies, especially the royal fantasia “Crown for Christmas. ” Schmaltzy? Check. Unrealistic? Of course. Inclusive? Hardly. The lack of representation of queer people has been only one part of the Hallmark Channel’s failed diversity efforts, which unfailingly presents “white Christmas” storylines, which is to say very few African Americans or other people of color in starring roles.
A white, straight Christmas
As an example, take the two-dozen holiday movies that Hallmark is debuting this month as part of its annual "Countdown to Christmas. " “None center on a same-sex couple or feature LGBTQ characters,” reported LGBTQ news website The Advocate. Fortunately, that failure to represent queer couples and families appeared to be coming to an end when the CEO of Crown Media Family Networks, the Hallmark Channel’s parent company, told The Hollywood Reporter in November they are "open" to any type of movie, including with gay leading characters.
It was a blessing to honor God at work: Chick-fil-A once inspired me to live out my faith in the workplace. Those days are gone.
After all, it’s nearly 2020. There are more than half a million same-sex married couples in the United States, now that gay marriage is legal in every state in the union.
Not coincidentally, before the Zola ads were pulled, the advocacy group One Million Moms, which is a part of the religiously conservative American Family Association and defines part of its mission as the “fight against indecency,” hosted a petition on its site that urged Hallmark to “reconsider airing commercials with same-sex couples, and please do not add LGBT movies to the Hallmark Channel. Such content goes against Christian and conservative values that are important to your primary audience. You will lose viewers if you cave to the LGBT agenda. ”
(As of Monday, the petition had only 30,000 names, while One Million Moms has just about 97,500 “likes” on Facebook. )
Wait, wait — there’s a gay agenda lurking within wedding planning ads? The only agenda I could find was a commercial one: The brides’ guests would have arrived on time and purchased them nicer gifts if they’d used Zola, which brands itself as “the home of all things wedding. ”
A Hallmark Channel spokesman told the New York Times that the brides’ “public displays of affection”— a typical lips-together smooch — were in violation of its policies. Well, that PDA policy wasn’t uniformly applied, since the channel had approved two Zola commercials and, in one of them, the heterosexual couple kissed, too.
A kiss is a kiss is a kiss
As I wrote in my book about LGBTQ etiquette: The acceptability of public displays of affection is about location, not sexual orientation. In other words, where you are (a club versus a church, the movies or the family dining room) and not who you are (a same-sex or opposite-sex couple).
To paraphrase Gertrude Stein: A kiss is a kiss is a kiss.
Do LGBTQ people still need to make the argument that we are families, too? That we are part of the fabric of American life, even as the Trump administration erases equal protections for members of our community? A Zola spokesman nailed it when he said, “All kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love. ”
Discrimination is far from dead: Obergefell: Supreme Court, lawmakers have more to do to prevent anti-LGBTQ discrimination
Zola was joined by an outpouring of support from the LGBTQ community and celebrities, with the Twitter hashtags #BoycottHallmark trending at one point over the weekend. Ellen DeGeneres and Sandra Bernhard, who played an openly bisexual character on “Roseann,” also weighed in with Bernhard tweeting: "All the groovy gay ladies i know won't be watching your Christmas schlock. "
On “Saturday Night Live” the Hallmark decision was mocked, and Netflix U. S. , a Hallmark competitor, tweeted images from a TV show and film labeled "Titles Featuring Lesbians Joyfully Existing And Also It's Christmas Can We Just Let People Love Who They Love. "
Finally, on Sunday, Hallmark Cards, Inc. , did the right thing, with its president and CEO saying the network would reinstate the Zola ads and stand up for diversity: “Our mission is rooted in helping all people connect, celebrate traditions and be inspired to capture meaningful moments in their lives. Anything that distracts from this purpose is not who we are. We are truly sorry for the hurt and disappointment this has caused. ”
Thank you, Hallmark.
Meanwhile, the One Million Moms website lists a number of active campaigns critical of the supposed "LGBTQ agenda. " Sure, you can try to erase us everywhere. But don’t forget: We are here. We get married. And for now we’ll watch sappy Christmas movies on Netflix and, yes, Hallmark.

U.S. Expelled Two Chinese Embassy Officials Suspected of Espionage; In September incident, the pair and their wives improperly drove onto a military facility in Virginia

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The U.S. quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage after they improperly drove onto a sensitive U.S. military facility in Virginia in September, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The incident highlights what U.S. officials have said is Beijing's increasingly aggressive intelligence-gathering operations against the U.S., which have heightened tensions between the two economic superpowers even as they try to reach accord on trade and other issues.
The expulsion of the officials, whose names couldn't be learned, took place as President Trump was trying to reach a broad trade agreement with China, and while he was under pressure to take a more forceful stance backing student protesters in Hong Kong.
The U.S. hasn't publicly acknowledged the incident, which was earlier reported by the New York Times. It is believed to be the first time the U.S. has expelled Chinese diplomats for suspected espionage in more than 30 years.
China issued a denial Monday. "The relevant U.S. allegations are totally false...We urge the U.S. to correct its wrongdoing, cancel its decision and protect the Chinese diplomats' interests and rights under the Vienna Convention diplomatic relations," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press conference.
The incident in September occurred at a sensitive installation in the Norfolk, Va., area, those familiar with the episode said. The two officials from the Chinese Embassy in Washington tried to gain access to the base but were turned away, one U.S. official said. Nonetheless, they drove about a mile onto the base before they were stopped and detained, U.S. officials said.
The Times reported that the group, which included the officials' wives, attempted to evade military personnel who pursued them and stopped only after firetrucks blocked their way. The Chinese officials then claimed they hadn't understood the guards' English instructions.
It isn't clear which U.S. military installation was breached. The Norfolk area has numerous military sites, including several that house Special Operations forces, including Navy SEALs.
The activity by the Chinese officials seems an unlikely way to gather secret intelligence. Rather, it may have been a way to test the base's security, or to send a psychological signal to the Americans that Beijing intends to become more aggressive in its espionage.
The Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is responsible for tracking foreign diplomats and stopping foreign espionage inside the U.S., declined to comment. The State Department declined to comment.
"We take the security of all our installations very seriously. We don't have any information to provide about the alleged incident," a Pentagon spokesman said. "We refer you to the Department of State for questions about Chinese diplomats."
Washington and Beijing are trying to compete and cooperate simultaneously in different arenas. The U.S. and China last week agreed to a so-called phase-one trade deal after months of tense negotiations.
The State Department in October imposed new restrictions on Chinese diplomats in the U.S., requiring that they notify the department before any meetings they have with state and local officials, or with educational and research institutions.
The new measures were primarily a response to even more stringent controls that China had placed on U.S. diplomats. But, one of the officials said, the incident in the Norfolk area was one factor that American policy makers discussed before imposing the new restrictions.

Texto completo: DEDHAM — The Maritana neared Boston Harbor after its long journey from Liverpool, laden with a cargo of coal, wool, iron, steel, and more than two dozen passengers and crew. It was after midnight on Nov. 3, 1861, and Captain G.W. Williams was in command. The weather was thick and the tide was high as they entered the bay. The ship had been navigating through a disastrous gale. From on board, a man on the lookout spotted Boston Light, a sign of welcome and voyage's end.
But as soon as the light came into view, so, too, did the froth of waves lashing rocks.
All hands were on deck. Orders came from Williams to tack ship. Before the vessel could change course, it crashed onto the jagged rocks about a mile from the lighthouse.
For hours, the Maritana was pummeled by the unforgiving sea. The waves churned up by the storm delivered incessant jabs amidships. Eventually, the sturdy wooden vessel could no longer endure, according to books about the shipwreck and several varying newspaper accounts from the time.
A gap opened beneath Williams's feet, as the ship split in half. “Look out for yourselves!" he shouted.
* * *
The demise of the Maritana has been called one of the region's “most violent shipwrecks," an event that reportedly claimed the lives of 13 passengers and 11 crew members. But the area's towering monument to the tragedy was erected some 16 miles inland, near the back of a historic burial ground in Dedham.
“What is it doing there?" reader Brian Keaney wondered. The town's Old Village Cemetery, where the marker bearing Williams's name is found, doesn't offer sweeping views of the Atlantic or the harbor islands.
Our journey to connect the dots between a suburban town and a deadly shipwreck meant navigating through folklore about a cursed artifact and wading into New England's maritime history.
First, the Maritana.
It was “a fine vessel," reported The Boston Pilot, six days after the storm, “991 tons, built at Quincy, Mass., and owned in Providence."
Every great ship needs a figurehead, the decoration placed at its bow, and the Maritana was no exception. When it was built in 1857, the ship's owner, Suchet Mauran II, took interest in a carving of a woman, maritime historian and Massachusetts native Edward Rowe Snow wrote in his book, “Storms and Shipwrecks of New England."
While noted for its beauty, the figurehead had a checkered past. The carving had been salvaged first from a commandeered French warship, and then, later, a ship built in Maine that wrecked off New England.
But the figurehead's time on the Maritana was largely uneventful, Snow said — until the ship set sail from Liverpool in September 1861.
* * *
In the early morning hours of Nov. 3, the ship — stocked with goods and passengers — finally approached Boston Harbor.
Around 12:45 a.m., the journey unraveled, however, when breakers were spotted around the same time as the lighthouse.
“Captain Williams ordered the helm hard up," one newspaper wrote, “and a minute later the ship struck, head on," at Egg Rock, also known as Shag Rocks.
The sea broke constantly over the vessel, “which lifted and hung among the rocks amidships."
The masts were cut away at 3 a.m., reports said. Boats on the davits were “crushed to atoms," The Boston Pilot recalled. The crew's attempts to reach safety were futile.
“The ship, being a very strong one, held together until morning," The Boston Pilot wrote.
Around 8 a.m., it finally began to break in two.
“At the moment the vessel parted, Capt. Williams was standing on the quarterdeck," the Transcript reported. “He went down between the broken fragments, which closing suddenly caught the Captain by the head and crushed it in a frightful manner."
* * *
In all, about two dozen people died. Some were lost to the ocean, while the bodies of others, including Williams, washed ashore.
Around a dozen people survived. They were brought to safety by a rescue operation launched from Hull, according to “Storms and Shipwrecks in Boston Bay, and The Record of Life Savers of Hull."
The New York Times reported that “not a vestige of the ship remained."
That is, except for its figurehead, which was recovered unscathed. Alleged to be cursed, it was passed from owner to owner until it eventually found a home.
“No ship's captain wanted her," the Bostonian Society, a nonprofit and steward of the Old State House and its collections wrote in a blog post.
In 1908, the figurehead was given to the Bostonian Society, which put it on display. It's said that a fire in 1921 started near the carving.
“She was sold and placed in a shop on Lincoln's Wharf . . . the wharf promptly caught on fire and burned!" the society said in the blog post.
Again, it survived.
The figurehead is no longer on display but remains in the museum's collections.
* * *
So what's left of the Maritana's memory? There is another link, bearing us back to the past: the lichen-encrusted monument of a ship's broken mast.
Some archives list Williams as “of Providence." But a small blurb in a Nov. 8, 1861, edition of the Boston Post told a different story. It was an announcement about his funeral.
“The obsequies of the late Capt. G. W. Williams of the ill-fated ship Maritana . . . took place from the residence of his family," it said, “in Dedham."
“The remains," it read, “were interred in the cemetery in that town."
To learn more about Williams's grave marker, we contacted Joan Pagliuca, a Dedham Historical Society board member. She met us at Old Village Cemetery, where a large tree towers over the four-sided marker, guarded by a shin-high border.
“To find the story of his ship is just an incredible story. Especially the headlines — 'The worst shipwreck ever in Boston Harbor,"' Pagliuca said. “And here he is; he's here in our little town cemetery."
The monument resembles a shattered mast wrapped by a torn rope. On one side of its plinth is a message in memory of the Maritana and Williams, “Who Perished In Boston Harbor Nov. 3, 1861, On The Homeward Passage."
A replica of the ship is carved in the stone. It is depicted approaching what's probably Boston Light. If you get close enough, you can see the details of its sails and masts.
Now get down on the ground, on this patch of earth 16 miles from the harbor. There, on the bow, is the faintest silhouette of a figurehead of a woman, staring blankly at the shoreline.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The U.S. quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage after they improperly drove onto a sensitive U.S. military facility in Virginia in September, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The incident highlights what U.S. officials have said is Beijing's increasingly aggressive intelligence-gathering operations against the U.S., which have heightened tensions between the two economic superpowers even as they try to reach accord on trade and other issues.
The expulsion of the officials, whose names couldn't be learned, took place as President Trump was trying to reach a broad trade agreement with China, and while he was under pressure to take a more forceful stance backing student protesters in Hong Kong.
Neither side has publicly acknowledged the incident, which was earlier reported by the New York Times. It is believed to be the first time the U.S. has expelled Chinese diplomats for suspected espionage in more than 30 years.
The incident in September occurred at a sensitive installation in the Norfolk, Va., area, those familiar with the episode said. The two officials from the Chinese Embassy in Washington tried to gain access to the base but were turned away, one U.S. official said. Nonetheless, they drove about a mile onto the base before they were stopped and detained, U.S. officials said.
The Times reported that the group, which included the officials' wives, attempted to evade military personnel who pursued them and stopped only after firetrucks blocked their way. The Chinese officials then claimed they hadn't understood the guards' English instructions.
It isn't clear which U.S. military installation was breached.
The Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment. The State Department declined to comment.
"We take the security of all our installations very seriously. We don't have any information to provide about the alleged incident," a Pentagon spokesman said. "We refer you to the Department of State for questions about Chinese diplomats."

Texto completo: Mr. Hatcher was one of the first two black people elected in 1967 as mayor of a large American city.
Richard G. Hatcher, one of the nation's first big-city black mayors who in two decades leading Gary, Ind., sought vainly to stem its poverty and blight while championing cities and blacks generally, died on Friday night in Chicago. He was 86.
His death, at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Renee Hatcher. The cause was not given.
Mr. Hatcher was elected mayor of Gary on Nov. 7, 1967, the same day that Carl B. Stokes, another black Democrat, was elected mayor of Cleveland. Mr. Hatcher served until losing a 1987 bid for a sixth four-year term; Mr. Stokes did not seek re-election after serving two two-year terms.
Mr. Hatcher was a 34-year-old city councilman and civil rights activist when he ousted the white incumbent in the Democratic mayoral primary and narrowly won a racially bitter general election. He took over a sharply segregated city of 175,000 that had become half black amid white flight, which would accelerate after his election.
He also took over a city whose economy was dependent on a single industry -- steel -- whose boom-and-bust history and automation were key factors in Gary's decline despite the efforts of Mr. Hatcher and subsequent mayors.
When Mr. Hatcher was elected, Gary's poverty rate was approaching 15 percent, black unemployment was twice the rate of white joblessness and, the new mayor said, more than 40 percent of housing in the city was unsound or needed major renovation. Crime levels were high and municipal corruption -- a major issue in his reform campaign -- was rife.
During his 20-year tenure, Gary garnered several hundred million dollars in federal aid for subsidized housing and job-training programs. A hotel was built, the local airport was expanded to handle commercial traffic and, in Mr. Hatcher's first term, the police force was enlarged by 40 percent.
Despite these efforts, when Mr. Hatcher left office in 1987, 25 percent of residents were living below the poverty level, unemployment exceeded 20 percent and violent crime was still a big concern. Substandard housing abounded, vacant storefronts lined business-district streets and the population had plummeted toward 117,000, according to the 1990 census, 85 percent of it black.
Mr. Hatcher repeatedly predicted that the city was about to turn the corner. "I think we're on the verge of a great new surge forward," he said in a 1978 interview in The New York Times, and he sounded similar refrains in his re-election campaigns.
He and his supporters argued that racism was a major force in Gary's continuing slide.
Citing a "tremendous" departure of existing businesses and private investment money in the 1978 interview, he charged, "There's almost a vested interest among a lot of powerful business people, the tax assessors and other county officials who keep business taxes low here, in proving that a city run by a black will fail." He also maintained that the federal government had provided too little aid.
Urban affairs experts have pointed to the volatile economic history of the steel industry and its automation of recent decades. The United States Steel Corporation founded the city in 1906 to house workers in the huge mill it was building in the area, and the mill was long Gary's largest employer. Its cycle of layoffs and recoveries impeded lasting economic stability in the city, and the automation later reduced jobs permanently.
When Mr. Hatcher left office, there were fewer than 10,000 people working at the mill, less than half the number when he was elected 20 years earlier. (Gary's decline continued after his mayoral tenure: The 2010 census recorded a 37 percent poverty rate in a population of 80,000.)
The mayor's critics accused him of contributing to the city's Rust Belt descent by squandering the federal money and, as one put it, by "chasing a national image and neglecting Gary."
Mr. Hatcher's explanations and promises of better times prevailed in his first four re-election campaigns, in which all his major opponents were also black. But the criticisms won out in the fifth when another black Democrat, Thomas V. Barnes, soundly beat him in the 1987 Democratic primary -- and again when Mr. Hatcher tried to oust Mr. Barnes four years later.
From the time he had first been elected, Mr. Hatcher was regarded by the national news media as a spokesman for the needs of urban America and blacks.
His persuasive manner and political pursuits beyond Gary kept him in that role even after black mayors were elected in the 1970s in Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington. (A black mayor had taken office in Washington shortly before Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Stokes were elected, but that official, Walter E. Washington, had been appointed by the federal government before residents there gained the right to elect their mayor in the '70s, when they voted to retain Mr. Washington.)
Mr. Hatcher was active in national Democratic politics, serving as a vice chairman of the party's national committee and as a leader of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns in the 1980s.
He led associations of city officials, and often testified before congressional committees on federal domestic policy, as when he contended that a budget proposal that included reduced federal aid for programs helping poor children and impoverished older people showed that cities "are increasingly viewed as repositories for the poor, the black, the Latin, the elderly -- those who are relatively powerless against the interests of stronger and more affluent elements of our society."
A decade later, he asserted that another Republican president, Ronald Reagan, was trying to "wash his hands" of such people with his efforts to transfer responsibility for numerous domestic programs to the states under the banner of a "new federalism." It was neglect by the states, Mr. Hatcher asserted, that produced most of the federal programs in the first place.
But Mr. Hatcher also found fault with liberals, black and white, telling a gathering of them that liberalism was "condescending" for conceiving leadership as coming "only from those who have made it in society." He called for a coalition of liberals, black power supporters and white radicals.
Richard Gordon Hatcher was born on July 10, 1933, one of 13 children of Carlton and Catherine Hatcher, in Michigan City, Ind., where his father worked for the railcar maker Pullman-Standard.
Richard Hatcher graduated from Indiana University and, in 1959, Valparaiso University Law School. Settling in Gary, he served as a deputy county prosecutor and worked in private practice, helping to represent plaintiffs in a lawsuit charging the Gary school system with segregation. He joined in picketing a local hospital because of its segregated room polices, and was elected to the City Council in 1963 and ran for mayor four years later.
Winning the Democratic primary was normally tantamount to winning the office in the overwhelmingly Democratic city, but the influential county Democratic organization supported the white Republican candidate in the general election, which Mr. Hatcher narrowly won. The organization said Mr. Hatcher had refused to cooperate with it; Mr. Hatcher called the accusation a "cover-up for the racial issue."
After leaving office, Mr. Hatcher opened a consulting firm and taught at Valparaiso and Indiana Universities.
He is survived by his wife, Ruthellyn Rowles; his daughters Ragen Hatcher, Rachelle Hatcher-Swan and Renee Hatcher; his sister, Margie Davis; and six grandchildren.

Texto completo: For more than a decade, a glass and chrome building on Harrisburg's Seventh Street has been at the center of America's student debt crisis.
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, an independent state agency that distributes state-funded college scholarships, was created 50 years ago to give modest grants and loans to Pennsylvania students. It's since morphed into one of the largest loan servicers in the nation, managing a portfolio worth more than $425 billion.
PHEAA, as it's more widely known, has come under fire in the press and in the halls of Congress recently for its role administering the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a federal initiative that's supposed to forgive student debt for nurses, teachers and other eligible professionals.
Borrowers across the country say PHEAA's failure to accurately track their loan payments made them ineligible for loan forgiveness.
PHEAA's operating costs are covered by revenue it earns as a loan servicer. But the agency still receives an annual line item in Pennsylvania's state budget to fund scholarships for in-state students.
It's also overseen by a board that includes 16 members of the state House and Senate, who said through a representative last week that they're powerless to do anything to help borrowers seeking federal loan forgiveness.
Here's how Pennsylvania got into the student loan business and what's happened since.
PHEAA's origins
Pennsylvania's Legislature created PHEAA in 1963 with a simple goal: to help students and their parents in the Commonwealth pay for higher education.
The act signed by then-Gov. William Scranton included a $1.2 million appropriation to get the lending operation off the ground. From there, PHEAA operated much like a traditional bank, borrowing money and loaning it out to Pennsylvania students at higher interest rates, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Its loan and grant programs have proliferated ever since.
To date, the agency has distributed 7 million scholarships totaling $11.4 billion through its PA State Grants Program, according to a handbook it published for Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
Although PHEAA scaled back its lending programs after the 2008 recession, it recently began advertising a new loan program called PA Forward, aimed at undergraduate and graduate students and their parents.
The agency also offers targeted scholarship funds, including one for students at Pennsylvania's historically Black universities and another for blind and deaf students.
Some of the funds for those grant programs come from annual appropriations in Pennsylvania's state budget. In the 2018-19 fiscal year, PHEAA got a total of $369 million from state coffers.
But the bulk of PHEAAs budget comes from its work as a loan servicer for federal and private lenders.
In that role, PHEAA facilitates payments between borrowers and the financial organizations that lend them money. Its employees also counsel borrowers who fall behind on their payments.
PHEAA began ramping up its loan servicing operation after the Great Recession in 2008 froze many borrowers out of the debt market, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
In 2009, the agency landed one of its most lucrative gigs to date: a 10-year, $1.3 billion contract to service federal loan forgiveness applications for the U.S. Department of Education.
'Missteps, errors and mismanagement'
Every day, thousands of borrowers across the country interact with PHEAA as they try to take advantage of an imperiled federal program that offers to forgive their student debt.
The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was created in 2007 to encourage more students to enter low-paying public service professions. It offers to wipe away debt for people who work as teachers, firefighters, public interest lawyers, or other qualifying professions, as long as they make 10 years' worth of loan payments while working for the government or eligible nonprofits.
A story published last month in The New York Times described the program as a beacon of hope for workers laden with student loans. But 99% of those who sought relief were rejected, the newspaper reported.
Borrowers and consumer advocates directed some of their ire at congressional lawmakers who wrote the loan forgiveness legislation, and the Department of Education, which administers the program.
But they reserved special criticism for PHEAA, which services loan payments as an entity called FedLoan.
Reviews dating back to 2015 found that PHEAA representatives lost track of loan payments and mistakenly told borrowers they were on track for forgiveness.
A report by a U.S. Department of Education watchdog found earlier this year that PHEAA provides some of the worst customer service among all of its private contractors.
Ten percent of calls to the FedLoan center in Harrisburg between May and June 2017 were considered "failed calls," meaning that employees failed to give struggling borrowers good information on their repayment options, according to a summary of the report in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
The U.S. Department of Education wrote a sternly worded letter to PHEAA in April demanding it improve wait times at the Harrisburg call center.
Congressional Democrats called on a federal consumer protection watchdog to investigate PHEAA in October, saying that its "missteps, errors and mismanagement" of loan forgiveness applications caused harm to tens of thousands of public servants and their families.
PHEAA is currently fighting separate federal lawsuits from the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, who say FedLoan miscounted loan payments and improperly rejected thousands of applicants who qualified for forgiveness.
Elected officials in Pennsylvania have been silent as borrowers and consumer watchdogs railed against the state's own publicly supported loan servicing corporation.
State lawmakers who sit on PHEAA's board deferred comment on the complaints to agency spokesman Keith New, who said FedLoan administers the program "in accordance with program rules and federal law.'
What's the payoff?
New declined to say whether the agency will seek to renew its contract with the U.S. Department of Education after it expires this month.
If its leaders decide to wash their hands of the cumbersome loan program, they may soon be looking to replace more than a billion dollars of revenue, since PHEAA'S contracts con-s:itute its largest source of income.
Executives say those contracts are a win for Pennsylvania taxpayers and students.
Revenue from PHEAA's loan-servicing business pays the agency's operating costs, including executive salaries that are among the highest in state government. CEO James Steeley earns $330,000 per year, according to PennWatch, a database of state employee salaries.
The revenue also funds scholarship programs for Pennsylvania students.
"We started making money and gave it all back to students," New said. "We do not want to be a drain on taxpayer dollars."
PHEAA's critics say there's a big problem with that defense, though. As the agency's loan portfolio has grown, the student debt crisis in Pennsylvania has gotten worse.
The average student loan debt for new graduates in Pennsylvania is nearly $37,000 per borrower - the second highest rate in the country, according to testimony Attorney General Josh Shapiro prepared for a congressional panel this summer.
That's partially because state support for public colleges and universities has failed to keep pace with inflation, especially after the Great Recession in 2008.
Pennsylvania's per-pupil spending on public universities fell by 30% between 2008 and 2017, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Awards from PHEAA's hallmark scholarship program, meanwhile, have stagnated.
PA State Grants scholarships have been capped at $4,123 for three consecutive years, according to PennLive. The scholarship program narrowly avoided deep budget cuts this year thanks to a lower-than-anticipated number of applicants.
Student debt comes to the Capitol
Lawmakers who sit on the loan agency's board may say they're powerless to help borrowers who blame PHEAA for mishandling their debt forgiveness applications.
But some of their colleagues in the Legislature are looking for alternate methods to hold student loan agencies to account.
State Rep. Jennifer O'Mara, D-Delaware, is a 30-year-old lawmaker who co-chairs the bipartisan Student Debt Caucus in Pennsylvania's state House.
O'Mara told the Capital-Star that the 20-member caucus is considering legislation that would create a statewide student debt ombudsman - an official who will investigate administrative mistakes or problems for Pennsylvania lenders.
O'Mara has spoken publicly about carrying $36,000 in student debt. She said she ran into her own problems with FedLoan when she was on her path to federal loan forgiveness.
When her statements didn't look right, she called PHEAA but never heard back. When she voiced her concerns at a House hearing on student debt in early December, the problem was fixed.
But O'Mara still learned a lesson from the exchange.
"It's frustrating I can only get that attention as a state representative calling them out in public," O'Mara told the Capital-Star.

Texto completo: The U.S. government quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials after they breached a sensitive military base in Virginia.
The Chinese officials were with their wives when they drove onto the base near Norfolk in September. The group fled military personnel pursuing them and were only stopped when fire trucks blocked their path, according to The New York Times.
American officials suspect at least one of the Chinese officials was an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.
The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying in more than three decades. In 1987, the United States apprehended two Chinese diplomat who had tried to obtain classified National Security Agency documents.
Neither the U.S. nor China announced the incident. It has fueled concerns about Chinese espionage in the U.S. as American officials increasingly warn about China’s threat to national security. American officials said Chinese officials with diplomatic passports have become more daring about showing up unannounced at research or government facilities.
Weeks after the intrusions, the State Department announced restrictions on Chinese diplomats, requiring them to give notice about their meetings with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions. The State Department said at the time that the restrictions were in response to Chinese regulations on the travel of U.S. diplomats.
The Chinese officials and their wives drove up to a checkpoint at the base, where Special Operations forces are stationed. A guard told the group they did not have permission to enter and asked them to go through the gate so that they could turn around and exit the base.
In stead, they continued on to the base and were eventually blocked by fire trucks. The officials claimed they did not understand the guard’s instructions and had gotten lost.
It is unclear what the Chinese were trying to accomplish at the base, but some U.S. officials said they could have been testing security measures.
In September 2018, Chinese student Zhao Qianli was arrested when he was found photographing an American defense intelligence installation near Key West, Florida. The student had gone around a fence that stopped at the ocean and walked onto the base to take photos, including an area with satellite dishes and antennae.
Zhao said he had gotten lost at the time of his arrest. He was sentenced to one year in prison.
A crackdown on Chinese espionage in the U.S. has picked up in recent years. Three former U.S. intelligence officers have been convicted in the last year of conspiring with the Chinese.
Most recently, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a longtime CIA officer, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. He was suspected of being a mole for the Chinese government who compromised CIA sources, some of whom were killed. Prosecutors were unable to prove that Lee gave classified information to the Chinese, but they argued it explained why he received more than $840,000 while he was being asked for information on the CIA.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, una importante figura de Wall Street a quien se adjudica haber salvado a Nueva York de la bancarrota murió el sábado a los 91 años de edad en su casa de Manhattan, anunció su hijo citado por The New York Times.
Este refugiado judío nacido en Austria y naturalizado estadounidense se hizo conocido en el campo de las finanzas acumulando éxitos en el sector de fusiones y adquisiciones y escalando lugares del prestigioso banco de inversión Lazard Frères (ahora Lazard).
Hábil negociador, se convirtió en un asesor escuchado por las élites políticas estadounidenses e innumerables hombres de negocios, construyendo una reputación como un hombre capaz de encontrar una solución aceptable para los problemas más difíciles. Lo llamaban “Felix, el reparador”.
Esta cualidad le valió la misión de salvar a Nueva York de la bancarrota en la década de 1970 , cuando la ciudad se estaba desmoronando. Una tarea que llevaría a cabo mucho más tiempo de lo inicialmente planeado, supervisando las finanzas de la ciudad durante 18 años.
“La vida extraordinaria de Felix Rohatyn es una historia emblemática de Nueva York”, dijo el alcalde de la ciudad, Bill de Blasio.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The U.S. quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage after they improperly drove onto a sensitive U.S. military facility in Virginia in September, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The incident highlights what U.S. officials have said is Beijing's increasingly aggressive intelligence-gathering operations against the U.S., which have heightened tensions between the two economic superpowers even as they try to reach accord on trade and other issues.
The expulsion of the officials, whose names couldn't be learned, took place as President Trump was trying to reach a broad trade agreement with China, and while he was under pressure to take a more forceful stance backing student protesters in Hong Kong.
Neither side has publicly acknowledged the incident, which was earlier reported by the New York Times. It is believed to be the first time the U.S. has expelled Chinese diplomats for suspected espionage in more than 30 years.
The incident in September occurred at a sensitive installation in the Norfolk, Va., area, those familiar with the episode said. The two officials from the Chinese Embassy in Washington tried to gain access to the base but were turned away, one U.S. official said. Nonetheless, they drove about a mile onto the base before they were stopped and detained, U.S. officials said.
The Times reported that the group, which included the officials' wives, attempted to evade military personnel who pursued them and stopped only after firetrucks blocked their way. The Chinese officials then claimed they hadn't understood the guards' English instructions.
It isn't clear which U.S. military installation was breached. The Norfolk area has numerous military sites, including several that house Special Operations forces, including Navy SEALs.
The activity by the Chinese officials seems an unlikely way to gather secret intelligence. Rather, it may have been a way to test the base's security, or to send a psychological signal to the Americans that Beijing intends to become more aggressive in its espionage.
The Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is responsible for tracking foreign diplomats and stopping foreign espionage inside the U.S., declined to comment. The State Department declined to comment.
"We take the security of all our installations very seriously. We don't have any information to provide about the alleged incident," a Pentagon spokesman said. "We refer you to the Department of State for questions about Chinese diplomats."
Washington and Beijing are trying to compete and cooperate simultaneously in different arenas. The U.S. and China last week agreed to a so-called phase-one trade deal after months of tense negotiations.
The State Department in October imposed new restrictions on Chinese diplomats in the U.S., requiring that they notify the department before any meetings they have with state and local officials, or with educational and research institutions.
The new measures were primarily a response to even more stringent controls that China had placed on U.S. diplomats. But, one of the officials said, the incident in the Norfolk area was one factor that American policy makers discussed before imposing the new restrictions.

Power struggle fuels 'Virtue and Vengeance'

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Why Maine authors love writing in a winter wonderland The beautiful and isolating winter finds its way into the work of many Maine authors, both as setting and inspiration.

Texto completo: Every time there's a snowstorm, Matt Tavares walks out his back door in Ogunquit and takes pictures to share with the world.
Not that he posts them on Facebook or Twitter or anything like that. He uses those images to bring an icy beauty and frozen authenticity to his children's picture books. His latest, "Dasher," came out in September and has made the New York Times children's best-sellers list. The book tells the story of how Santa's reindeer came to be. Besides using the look of Maine's snowdrifts and icicles to shape his "Dasher" drawings, Tavares says Maine winters also inspire him to do some of his best work.
"I do a lot of my writing during the winter. I find winter in Maine is a good time to clear your mind and really focus on your story," said Tavares. "I take walks in winter to picture the story in mind. I find it inspiring."
Maine's long, beautiful and isolating winters play a major role in the works of many Maine authors, both as setting and inspiration. Some are children's books, like "Dasher," where the state's landscape is the model for a universal winter wonderland, or a setting for Christmas and holiday stories. But there are also novels where the power of Maine's winter intensifies the story, whether it's a mystery, romance or other human drama.
"The challenge of creating a Maine winter in fiction is finding all the elements that make it especially challenging, especially wonderful, especially deadly," said Maine author Bill Roorbach, whose 2014 novel "The Remedy for Love" is set in a blizzard. "I do think beauty is at the top of that list. How could anything so gorgeous be deadly?"
PICTURE THIS
Children's authors often find fertile ground in Maine's winters. There's the stark beauty of snow and ice mixed with the picturesque natural scenery and quaint small-town scenes found all over the state. There are some classic Christmas books featuring Maine ideas and images, like "Christmas in Maine" by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert P. Tristram Coffin, first published in 1941. It's a nostalgic and charming look at a Maine farmhouse crammed with family, food and fun, and includes a wintry sleigh ride. A picture book for all ages, it was republished by Islandport Press in 2015 with original woodblock prints by Maine artist Blue Butterfield.
"My Wonderful Christmas Tree" by noted Maine artist Dahlov Ipcar is another long-loved children's book inspired by a Maine winter. First published in 1986, it features images of nature that Ipcar could see from the window of her home in Georgetown.
Winthrop author Lynn Plourde has set seven of her 35 children's books in winter, including "If I Could Give You Christmas," which came out in September and was illustrated by Jennifer L. Meyer. The book is about the small meaningful moments of the holiday season, like spending time together, embodied by Maine's winter woodland creatures, including moose, deer, otters, lynx, fox and squirrels.
Plourde, who has been writing children's books for more than 20 years, says using a Maine winter as a setting has broad appeal. When people idealize winter they think of the kind of winters we have in Maine, trees frosted with a thick coating of snow, kids making snowmen, long icicles hanging from the roof. They don't think of, say, a mid-Atlantic winter, where people use umbrellas in snowstorms and two inches of accumulation can cause miles of traffic tie-ups.
Plus, there's something comforting about the idea of the kind of long winter days Mainers endure.
"People say the evenings are so long, but I say, 'Oh, it's a nice long evening for reading or writing,' " said Plourde, a Maine native. "And it's beautiful here in the winter, a different kind of beauty."
Tavares grew up near Boston and came to Ogunquit during summers. So he didn't experience a Maine winter until he went to Bates College in Lewiston, where he studied art. Since graduating more than 20 years ago, he's illustrated 20 children's books, half of which he wrote. His 2017 bestseller, "Red and Lulu," also had wintry elements, like snow and towering evergreens. It is the story of two birds who become separated when their evergreen is cut down and taken to a big city to be used as part of the holiday decorations.
Tavares began "Dasher" because his editor thought a holiday-themed book with wintry images would catch people's eye. He researched the written history of Santa Claus and decided to make Dasher and the other reindeer a family, who are part of a traveling circus before they meet Santa. Then he started sketching, using his backyard snow pictures and scenes around Ogunquit as models. He even used a picture of the Ogunquit shoreline taken from a drone. In the book, there's a scene where Santa and his sleigh are flying over a town. Below, the reader can see hotels and church steeples and the general shape of the Ogunquit's shoreline, covered in snow.
"I love painting and drawing new-fallen snow," said Tavares.
A NOVEL APPROACH TO WINTER
Novelists say a Maine winter helps shape their stories in unique and surprising ways.
"I like the way setting a story in a storm limits the size of the stage for the characters, it limits movements and presents challenges," said author Lewis Robinson of Portland, whose 2009 novel "Water Dogs" is set in a Maine snowstorm. "The quiet serenity of a snowstorm can sharpen focus on the interior action."
Robinson says he does his best work in winter, finding he "can't write that well in summer" with all the distractions. "Water Dogs" is about two Maine brothers in their 20s who've lost their father, dealt with a variety of personal issues and economic challenges, and love paintball. During a paintball game in a snowstorm, a rival goes missing. A mystery ensues.
Anthony Doerr, who has since won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2014 novel "All the Light We Cannot See," reviewed Robinson's book for the New York Times and was extremely enamored of the descriptions of snow. "Open practically any page of this book and crystals will shake out," wrote Doerr, who knows something about Maine winters, having graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick in 1995.
Robinson said he set the book in a March snowstorm because that's something unique to Maine and evocative to Mainers.
"Just when the rest of the country is warming up, we get hit with another storm," said Robinson. "No matter how many times we've been through this (in Maine), we still think spring is going to come early some year."
Midcoast author Paul Doiron set his 2016 mystery "Widow-Maker" at a fictional western Maine ski resort. He had written about "hardcore, bone-chilling Maine winters" before, with sled dogs and snowmobiles and such. But "Widow-Maker" delves into the culture of winter in Maine, especially areas that rely on winter tourists for economic stability, and other places that are practically empty after summer tourists leave. The game warden Mike Bowditch investigates a woman's disappearance, which leads to him exploring his own past and inner demons. With the foreboding winter landscape and mountains all around.
"Trying to describe what Maine is like in winter, after millions of visitors have left, struck me as an interesting challenge," said Doiron.
Roorbach, who splits his time between Farmington and Scarborough, said he set "The Remedy for Love" during a Maine winter because "there's no winter like a Maine winter. Cold, for sure, and isolated, but so charged with the energy of blue skies that we forget there are miles to go. "
The book is about a man and a woman who meet at the grocery store, just before a "storm of the century" type blizzard is about to pound western Maine. The man helps the woman get food and firewood for the rustic cabin she's living in, but after his car disappears, he becomes stranded with her as the storm rages. Roorbach said his idea was to put two dissimilar individuals together in an emergency and see if they fall in love.
The storm provides beauty, drama and, of course, the excuse for the pair spending so much time together.
"And then the sun sets. Oh, how pretty, and then the power goes off. Oh, how romantic. And then the emergency continues, day one, day two, day three, a week, 10 days," said Roorbach. "The joy, of course, is allowing Maine itself to become a character, and winter a mood."

Texto completo: I removed my glasses the second I stepped inside Enio's dining room, swabbed them on the sleeve of my coat, then slid them back onto the bridge of my nose. Nope: still blurry. Was the temperature differential of frigid, dry wind outside versus toasty, garlic-scented air inside the narrow trattoria causing my lenses to fog?
"It's not you. Look up," my dinner guest said, squinting at the gauzy glow around the lightbulbs. "It's a little overcast in here."
Enio's is a tiny operation that prides itself on making nearly everything it serves from scratch. That's all the more remarkable when you stop to consider that chef/co-owner Laura Butler runs the back-of-house single-handed, aided only by a dishwasher. Similarly, her husband, co-owner Bob Butler, handles the front solo, with a single busser as backup.
"We're basically a low-key, mom-and-pop place, and we've always done things that way, all the way back to 1996 (when the couple opened Rachel's Wood Grill on Exchange Street in Portland)," Laura Butler said. "We make everything ourselves and get our inspiration from eating out when we visit Italy, little places where the emphasis is on food and wine, letting that be the focus, not being flashy."
To be sure, the former bakery (and flower shop) that houses the South Portland restaurant is so unassuming, it blends stealthily into the stretch of residences that surround it. If you are not on the lookout for Enio's, you might drive past without ever noticing it.
The interior is equally modest: checkerboard linoleum floors, banquettes fashioned from planks charred in the style of Japanese shou sugi ban and off-white walls that reflect the space's diffuse, warm yellow light.
Since mid-2013, when a mostly positive review in this paper described the then-new restaurant as "clean, light and unfussy," little has changed at Enio's, and that includes chef Laura Butler's charmingly "uncomplicated" cooking. Except now, thanks to an open-flame grill installed that autumn (the source of the Vaseline-lens haze that floats over the dining room), her menus have expanded to feature wood-grilled dishes.
These days, brawny cuts of meat like a grill-marked, medium-rare Maine Family Farms pork chop ($31) drizzled with veal reduction and angled, teetering on an enormous portion of porcini-and-fontina risotto, are among Enio's most popular (and successful) dishes.
You'll also find wood-grilled proteins playing supporting roles alongside the dozen or so varieties of homemade pasta that Laura Butler prepares. My favorite is the fat link of blistered Italian-style sausage, prickling with aromatic sage, allspice and rosemary, that she nestles into an ample portion of semolina-and-durum wheat radiatore ($28). Stirred through with kale, roasted red peppers and smoky half-moons of sweet delicata squash, it's a rustic Italian daydream of autumn in New England.
While Enio's dense, nearly cheesecake-like St. Louis Butter Cake with macerated strawberries and house-made chocolate ice cream ($10) isn't Italian, it is a testament to the breadth of Laura Butler's culinary skill, not to mention tenacity in her commitment to scratch cooking. That extends to snacks and appetizers like rich chicken liver mousse topped with a softly bittersweet balsamic vinegar and cabernet sauvignon reduction ($8), where even the accompanying grilled toasts are made from airy-crumbed homemade sourdough.
Yet when Enio's goes off-script things can also go awry, such as when thick slices of that same crusty bread are overloaded with lemon-infused Spanish Matiz sardines, pickled onions and a groaning portion of veiny bleu cheese ($15). What results is a crackling short-circuit of savory and umami flavors on an unwieldy dish. Just ask the couple sitting at one of the bar-height window seats near me last week. I watched as one lifted a toast from his plate and promptly liberated all the toppings into the lap of his friend. The two just laughed it off and ordered another couple of glasses of wine.
On Bob Butler's judicious selection of well-priced, mostly Italian, entirely Old World wines are plenty of options to help you recover from the agony of a lapful of preserved fish. His well-balanced list also seems engineered for pairing with wood-grilled proteins and simple vegetable dishes, especially the tannic, Sangiovese- and Nebbiolo-based Tuscan reds.
One menu item that stands up particularly well to wines with a bit of astringency is the wilted spinach appetizer ($11), a straightforward-appearing plate of sauteed greens seasoned with spinach pesto. Hidden among the thousands of rumpled pleats are flecks of garlic and cannellini beans barely beginning to molt from their skins, white flesh spreading into a blur - a starchy parallel to the soft-focus of woodsmoke floating a few feet above.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, a pioneer of Wall Street's lucrative corporate-acquisition business who steered New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s and remained an unelected guardian of its finances for almost two decades, has died. He was 91.
Rohatyn's death at his home in Manhattan on Saturday was reported by the New York Times, citing his son Nicolas. No cause of death was given.
As managing director of Lazard Freres & Co., now Lazard Ltd., Rohatyn earned the not entirely flattering nickname "Felix the Fixer" for his deal-making during the mergers-and-acquisitions boom that began in the 1960s. He exerted similar influence in government finance starting in the 1970s.

"Felix may have come as close as any man -- certainly any Jewish man -- in the past century to replicating, in his own, less ostentatious way, the extraordinary financial, political and social influence that J.P. Morgan had wielded in the previous one," William Cohan wrote in his 2007 book, "The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Freres & Co."
Rohatyn landed his most public post in 1975, when New York City's finances reached a crisis point.
The city had accumulated short-term debt of about $6 billion, was running budget deficits in excess of $1.5 billion and found itself effectively locked out of credit markets where it could sell new bonds and notes. New York Gov. Hugh Carey and state lawmakers created the Municipal Assistance Corp., empowered it to issue bonds on the city's behalf and gave it control over the city's sales-tax revenue to repay lenders.
Rohatyn, who advised Carey during negotiations over the panel's creation, became chairman of the nine-member board in September 1975. Nine months later, Carey also named him to the state's Emergency Financial Control Board, increasing his power over the city's budget.
The panels guided the city back to fiscal health. The threat of bankruptcy receded in 1978 when the federal government approved $1.65 billion in loan guarantees for New York. Carey's successor as governor, Mario Cuomo, later said of Rohatyn's role: "It would be difficult to exaggerate it. He literally saved the city from bankruptcy."
As chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corp. through 1993, Rohatyn retained extraordinary power to decide how to spend the city's surplus revenue. In all, he amassed and distributed about $3.5 billion, favoring causes close to his heart such as education and mass transit, the New York Times reported in 1993. In his exercise of public power as a private citizen, Rohatyn resembled his hero, Jean Monnet, the French economist who made European economic and political union his lifelong mission, without ever holding public office.
Not everybody celebrated Rohatyn's broad influence. His uneasy relationship with Ed Koch, New York's mayor from 1978 through 1989, flared into acrimony when Rohatyn, shortly after Koch left office, criticized him for the generosity of city labor contracts.
Firing back, Koch accused Rohatyn of stockpiling those billions in city tax revenue by intentionally underestimating interest accruing on money held by the corporation.
Felix George Rohatyn was born May 29, 1928, in Vienna, an only child. His mother, the former Edith Knoll, a pianist, came from a family of wealthy Viennese merchants. His father, Alexander, worked in breweries owned by his own father, who ran a bank.
With anti-Semitism on the rise in Europe in the 1930s, Rohatyn's parents moved their family to Romania, then to France. After they divorced, Rohatyn, at 8, was sent to a French-speaking boarding school in Switzerland. By the time he rejoined his mother in Paris, she had a new husband, Henry Plessner, whose precious-metals company did business with Lazard Freres et Cie.
With German troops approaching Paris, Rohatyn and his mother fled south to Biarritz; Plessner, a Polish citizen, escaped from an internment camp and met them there. The family spent a year in Cannes before securing, from the Brazilian government, the visas they needed to leave France.
Decades later, Rohatyn would learn from the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation that Luiz Martins de Souza Dantas, Brazil's wartime ambassador to France, had provided the visas as part of his secret effort to save Jews.
After yet more stops -- in Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Brazil -- the family reached New York City in June 1942. The two-year odyssey, Cohan wrote, made Rohatyn "preternaturally pessimistic about the outcome of events, extremely conservative financially and far less prone to excessive ostentation than most of his extremely wealthy investment banking peers."
In New York, Rohatyn attended the McBurney School and graduated in just two years while mastering English. He enrolled at Middlebury College in Vermont, intending to pursue a career in physics or engineering. Upon his graduation in 1949, he got a summer job at Lazard Freres in New York through his stepfather. He worked his way up, interrupted by a two-year stint in the U.S. Army, and became a partner in 1961.
He was a protege of managing partner Andre Meyer, an innovator in the growing field of mergers and acquisitions. Rohatyn helped Meyer buy, improve and then sell Avis Inc. to International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. for a hefty profit. That deal "led directly to the creation of the M&A advisory business and Lazard's domination of it," Cohan wrote.
Much of Lazard's early acquisitions work was in support of ITT's buying spree under then-Chairman Harold Geneen, the executive widely credited with creating the multinational conglomerate.
ITT's 1968 announcement that it would buy Hartford Fire Insurance Co. for $1.5 billion led to 13 years of litigation and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service into the sale of stock as part of the transaction.
According to Cohan's book, federal prosecutors convened a grand jury to consider whether Rohatyn -- an ITT director as well as its point person at Lazard -- had committed any crime in the case. No charges were filed, and Rohatyn told Cohan that he had "absolutely no recollection" of a criminal investigation.
The case also raised questions about whether President Nixon's administration had undercut an antitrust investigation of ITT in exchange for a $400,000 corporate contribution to the 1972 Republican National Convention.
Rohatyn had met with then-Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst to try to head off the antitrust investigation. When the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings to weigh whether the case should affect Kleindienst's nomination as attorney general, Rohatyn was by his side.
Kleindienst testified that the Nixon White House had stayed out of the antitrust matter. He was confirmed and served a year as attorney general, then pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of perjury when records established that the Nixon administration -- and even Nixon personally -- had in fact intervened on ITT's behalf.
The affair tarnished Rohatyn's name. The Washington Post's Nicholas von Hoffman gave him the pejorative label "Felix the Fixer."
Bad publicity didn't stop his rise, though. In 1970, the New York Stock Exchange named him to head a committee charged with stanching a run of brokerage failures caused by back offices being overwhelmed by surging trading volume. The "Crisis Committee" pulled Wall Street out of trouble. Carey's call to help save New York City came in 1975.
Rohatyn earned no salary for his city service and continued to steer deals at Lazard, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s $4.9-billion acquisition of Nabisco Inc. in 1985, the $15.7-billion merger of Time Inc. and Warner Bros. in 1990, and Viacom Inc.'s takeover of Paramount Communications in 1994 for $9.6 billion.
He also remained an important voice on Wall Street, even if his advice wasn't always followed. In a 1992 article, he warned that derivatives -- the complex financial instruments that would play a central role in the global credit crisis of 2007 -- were "financial hydrogen bombs" created by "26-year-olds with computers." His 2009 book urged the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank to direct federal funds to roads, bridges and schools in greatest need of money.
Long seen as a candidate to lead Lazard, Rohatyn declined the chance in the late 1970s. Toward the end of his long tenure he battled publicly with Steven Rattner, a one-time protege who seemed to be on the path to chairman. Rattner left Lazard in 2000 to start a private-equity firm.
Rohatyn's financial support of the Democratic Party was almost rewarded in 1996 when President Clinton floated his name as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. In the face of opposition by Republican senators, Rohatyn withdrew from consideration. Clinton then named Rohatyn as U.S. ambassador to France, a post he held from 1997 through 2000.
In April 2001, he founded Rohatyn Associates in New York to provide financial advice to corporations. In 2006, he joined Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. as an advisor to Chief Executive Richard Fuld, an affiliation that ended when the firm declared bankruptcy two years later.
Among other roles, Rohatyn was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, vice chairman of Carnegie Hall and a commander in the French Legion of Honor.
Rohatyn had three sons -- Pierre, Nicolas and Michael -- with his first wife, Jeannette Streit, who died in 2012. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. That year he married the former Elizabeth Fly Vagliano, who served as president of the New York Public Library and founded a nonprofit group, Teaching Matters Inc., that trains public-school teachers. She died in October 2016.

Texto completo: Like any good New Yorker, I mind my own business on the subway. Unless I'm in a bad mood, like that cold day last week when nobody was emailing me back, and my jeans were too tight, and I was late for a meeting I didn't want to go to and this kid turned his profane rap music up to full volume on the platform. Black and brown teenagers are often overpoliced in public spaces, but this kid was as white as Post Malone.
I spotted a small child a few feet away. Perfect. "Turn that off!" I boomed at the teenager, modeling my voice on that Theranos scammer. "Can't you see there is a small child over there?" I didn't care about the child -- she was probably listening to a podcast about murder, anyway -- I was just cranky. But more than that, I didn't need anyone breaking the social contract we all silently enter into when we disappear below ground.
Swiping that MetroCard or jumping that turnstile admits us to a world full of complex rules. I don't mean "let the passengers off first" or "don't spread your giant, important legs" or even "pay the fare." The M.T.A. is about to hire 500 new police officers "mainly to support fare evasion and homelessness outreach mitigation efforts," according to its budget proposal. This has many riders incredulous -- both at the cost, which is $ 50 million a year at a time when the subway is running a huge deficit and desperately needs investment in repairs, and the fact that the New York Police Department says crime on the subway is lower now than it was last year.
Concerned riders have shared videos and photos of police tasing and pointing guns at black teenagers for not paying the fare and hauling away a weeping food vendor's cart. I've noticed graffiti saying "More churros less cops." I'm tempted to take out my pen and correct it to "fewer cops," but otherwise I approve of the sentiment. I'm not worried about an immigrant woman providing treats for a dollar apiece or people who need to get somewhere but can't afford the $ 2.75 fare. I am worried about overcrowding, delays, the welfare of M.T.A. workers and, of course, small children's ears.
The rules I truly care about are the ones that aren't written down, like "don't bother each other" and "keep your eyes on your phone screen at all times." Sometimes, when I take a break from staring at mine and stretch my crooked little neck up to see how many stops I have left, I accidentally lock eyes with someone else. We frown at each other and go back to our screens. As it should be.
That said, every now and then, paying attention can be wonderful. I looked out the window of the B train one afternoon and watched as a woman who had been sitting opposite me took two steps onto the platform, looked at her hand, and then whipped her head back at the train with horror. Right then, the man beside me lunged at the man opposite me. I thought he was attacking him, but he was reaching between his legs because he'd spotted a diamond ring on the floor. He leapt toward the door and handed the ring to the frantic woman, whose face broke into a huge smile. It was as if she were getting proposed to all over again, except this time by a stranger speckled in cement. He apologized to the guy he'd jumped at and we all shared a laugh. It felt good. Thirty-five minutes later, I waved goodbye to the speckled man. He made a "Who the hell are you?" face. He'd forgotten we'd shared that moment and, honestly, that made it perfect.
I don't want to romanticize the subway. It drives me crazy with delays and crowding. When I first moved to New York I was wowed with the possibilities for a dreamily inclusive future that the trains opened up. I would gaze starry-eyed at an elderly Orthodox Jewish man dozing beside a guy with a mohawk and a leather jacket reading beside a woman in a sari holding a baby, etc. Six years later I just want to get a seat so that I can trawl Instagram and eat my churros in peace.
Perhaps I wasn't being naïve, though, according to the book "International Express: New Yorkers on the 7 Train," about the busy Queens subway line where 80 languages are spoken. "A most remarkable characteristic of the process whereby one becomes an urbanite on mass transit is that the ethnic and racial categories that might seem to distance one from fellow passengers are usually and quickly dismissed as secondary," the authors write. "This process of knowing-yet-ignoring whereby riders become 'blasé' New Yorkers on the subways is essential to the establishment of a community in transit."
Still, I worry that we're not all in it together. I wonder how many rich people ever use the train. I wonder why Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the M.T.A. are prioritizing the wrong solutions, and I wonder if I can stand many more years of unreliable service. Then something happens that gets me all mushy again.
Last month, I was in Bushwick waiting for the M train to take me into Manhattan when I saw someone sprint onto the platform and just make it through the closing doors of a J train. He hadn't noticed that he had dropped his wallet on the platform. A woman picked it up and looked at me, making a "What do I do now?" gesture. I reluctantly took out my headphones and asked to see the wallet. The man's ID was in it and I quickly found him on Instagram. His bio stated he was born in Donetsk, Ukraine, and his account showed his work. He's an M.F.A. candidate at Hunter, a conceptual artist. I messaged him and waited to hear back. Then the M came. I got on with the woman and her small child, who leaned against me as I showed them the artist's work. The artist responded right as we boarded the M, saying he would get off the train three stops later. He did, and so did the woman and her child, who waved back at me like we were old friends. I carried on and from my seat on the moving train, I saw that the artist got his wallet back.

Texto completo: When Zozibini Tunzi was named Miss Universe on Sunday, it signified the first time that black women had simultaneously held the top prize in four of the major beauty pageants.
When Zozibini Tunzi of South Africa was named Miss Universe on Sunday, her crowning signified a milestone: the first year that four of the major beauty pageants had simultaneously awarded the top prize to a black woman.
Pageants have long been criticized for their antiquated beauty standards and, in many cases, outright racism or gender stereotyping. Last year, the Miss America Organization announced it would scrap both the swimsuit and evening gown portions of the competition. And while black women have been winners in the past -- notably Vanessa Williams, who in 1984 was the first black woman to be named Miss America -- they have never been as successful as this year.
Supporters of the women -- Ms. Tunzi, Cheslie Kryst (this year's Miss USA), Kaliegh Garris (Miss Teen USA) and Nia Franklin (Miss America) -- say the recognition sends a powerful message that today's beauty standards are evolving beyond Barbie-lite, or an era when contestants were prized solely for smooth hair, light skin color and thin lips.
"Finally the universe is giving value to black skin," read an Instagram post from Leila Lopes, a former Miss Angola who was crowned Miss Universe in 2011. Oprah also praised Ms. Tunzi for her leadership. But perhaps the new Miss Universe put it best in her closing address on Sunday night.
"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me, with my kind of skin and my kind of hair, was never considered beautiful," she told the rapt crowd. "I think it is time that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face. And I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."
Hilary Levey Friedman, a visiting professor of education at Brown University who is writing a book about beauty pageants, said a new definition of what it means to be a pageant winner was being embraced in this era when questions of equality and inclusion are increasingly urgent.
"The idea of what we think is beautiful has expanded," she said. "Skin color. Body type. Curly hair. If you look at all this year's winners, they look like themselves."
This is a far cry from 1968, when women protested outside the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Throwing girdles, bras and false eyelashes, they denounced the fact that the pageant had not had a black finalist since its inception in 1921. That night, black women participated in their own pageant several blocks away.
Saundra Williams was crowned Black Miss America at that event, telling The New York Times: "With my title, I can show black women that they too are beautiful, even though they have large noses and thick lips. There is a need to keep saying this over and over because for so long none of us believed it."
Since then, pageant standards have slowly evolved, even as the events' purpose has increasingly been called into question. Black women have also continued to remain severely underrepresented in corporate America and Congress.
Dr. Levey Friedman, who is white and whose mother, Pamela Eldred, was named Miss America for 1970, said that in researching her coming book, "Here She Comes: The Tarnished Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America," she found that the number of women of color participating in beauty pageants was on the rise.
According to her research, few to no women of color were represented in the Miss USA pageant before the 1990s. Then Carole Gist won Miss USA in 1990, and Janel Bishop won Miss Teen USA in 1991. By the 2000s, Dr. Levey Friedman said, the number of contestants of color had risen to double digits each year. She said she expected the trend to continue.
"So many people have the stereotype that beauty queens are blond, have light eyes and a Barbie doll body," she said. "Now you don't have to look like Barbie. There are different versions of beauty and they are being accepted."

Join HK kids in protesting Chinese tyranny

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Review: A Brother and Sister Triumph Together at Carnegie Hall
The cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason gave a superb New York recital debut alongside the pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason.
In 2016, the British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason won the prestigious BBC Young Musician of the Year Award. Early in 2018, his debut recording on the Decca label was released, including his arrangement of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry," which has been streamed more than 11 million times on Spotify.
But this attention paled next to the overnight fame he achieved from a single performance in May 2018, when he played during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, watched on television by an estimated 1.9 billion people.
On Wednesday, things were decidedly more intimate when Mr. Kanneh-Mason, 20, gave his New York recital debut in Carnegie Hall's 268-seat Weill Recital Hall, alongside his slightly older sister, the pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason. (Her own Decca album, of works by Clara Schumann, has just been named to The New York Times's list of the best classical recordings of the year.)
Mr. Kanneh-Mason is a gifted, sensitive artist. And in the demanding works this duo performed -- especially Rachmaninoff's rhapsodic and teeming Sonata in G Minor, which has a virtuosic piano part -- Ms. Kanneh-Mason was a superb collaborator.
The program, available in its entirety at wqxr.org, opened with Beethoven's 12 Variations on "Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen." The jaunty theme comes from Papageno's song in Mozart's "The Magic Flute," in which the rustic bird catcher explains that what he wants most in life is a loving wife. From the first statement of the theme in Beethoven's jolly arrangement, Mr. Kanneh-Mason brought out the wistful subtext of the music, the yearning and loneliness the character feels, with rich, focused tone and elegant phrasing. As the variations grew in intricacy and inventiveness, these impressive musicians responded with crisp stylishness.
They then gave an intense account of Lutoslawski's aptly titled "Grave," a kind of argumentative dialogue that opens with a searching, fragmented theme for cello, which Mr. Kanneh-Mason played with grim beauty. This brooding piece, dotted with skittish, mysterious outbursts for both cello and piano, has a distressed and confused quality, well conveyed here.
By contrast, Barber's Opus 6 Sonata, written when its composer was 22, is a forthright, dynamic and impassioned work. Yet while conveying the soaring lyricism and flinty harmonic vitality of the music, these players teased out the unsettled urgency that runs through the score -- even the glowing slow movement, with its fantastical middle section.
Though these charismatic young artists received a prolonged ovation, they played no encore. What they'd already done in this small space was statement enough.
Sheku and Isata Kanneh-Mason
Performed on Wednesday at Weill Recital Hall, Manhattan.

Minors leadership swings back at MLB after Winter Meetings

Texto completo: Baseball's Winter Meetings are over, but the battle between Minor and Major League Baseball rages on.
Friday evening, MiLB fired off a four-page rebuttal to a dozen points raised in negotiations for a new Professional Baseball Agreement between the sides and, in their view, in disparaging public comments, e-mails, and photographs coming from MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and his deputy, Dan Halem, in San Diego this past week.
The sides engaged in both formal and informal discussions last Friday at the start of the meetings about their PBA, which is set to expire next September and which drew public outcry when it was revealed MLB proposed stripping 42 teams across the country of their major-league affiliation.
On Monday, MiLB president Pat O'Conner expressed cautious optimism, saying talks were productive. On Tuesday, Halem spoke with the Globe, and on Wednesday, Manfred addressed reporters.
“MLB has repeatedly and inaccurately stated the position of MiLB," their missive began, “with respect to several key areas under consideration in the PBA negotiations."
Halem turned over to the Globe an internal e-mail from Carolina League president Geoff Lassiter, asking its 10 teams if any had interest in exploring a sale of their club to establish a new franchise in Wilmington, N.C. In MLB's opinion, the e-mail — dated late last month, while minor-league owners were decrying MLB's contraction proposal — demonstrated that minor-league owners were willing to move teams from their communities with no compunction, and do so frequently.
While turning over the e-mail could also be seen as retaliation for media revelations from October about an in-progress team list that Halem sent to MiLB president Pat O'Conner in confidence, MiLB said the e-mail Halem revealed was more damning to MLB's stance.
“It was not an offer for teams to relocate, but rather a request for an expression of interest," said MiLB's statement. “What MLB failed to disclose [after making the assertion that MiLB team owners jump from city to city in search of a better deal], were the responses to the very e-mail they shared, which were that more MLB-owned teams reported an interest in relocating than non-MLB owned teams."
According to multiple industry sources, three of the five Carolina League teams that expressed interest in exploring a move to Wilmington are MLB-owned teams.
Halem showed to the Globe 21 color photographs of shoddy or unsafe conditions and facilities at minor-league ballparks. Three of them were from two Appalachian League teams: The Kingsport (Tenn.) Mets and Bristol (Va.) Pirates.
Major League Baseball owns the 10-team Appalachian League. Teams effectively lease the franchises, and are responsible for their upkeep and maintenance. In other words, those two MLB franchises allowed those facilities to deteriorate. The 42-team hit list includes nine of the 10 Appalachian League teams.
Said the MiLB: “In many cases, MiLB teams have already worked with their MLB counterpart to address special needs, despite no contractual obligation to do so. As in many cases with MLB's argument, they fail to acknowledge issues are not a matter of non-compliance, but rather a point to be addressed in a new set of standards."
And, said MiLB, it “has offered on multiple occasions to discuss and negotiate reasonable facility standards in the next agreement to address any unmet needs of MLB. Minor League Baseball has never expressed to MLB an unwillingness to address new standards and improvements in facilities."
Manfred professing chagrin about learning minor-leaguers sometimes traveled by school bus was met with derision.
“Despite the Commissioner's repeated misleading statements to the contrary, no minor league player in affiliated baseball is transported on a school bus," MiLB wrote. “The only situation where MLB-contracted players travel by school bus or passenger van occurs in MLB-owned and operated leagues in Florida [Gulf Coast League], Arizona [Arizona Summer League], and the Dominican Republic [Dominican Summer League]."
As for MLB's Dream League, a plan to place unaffiliated players in teams in place of many of the affected cities, MiLB continued to use nightmarish language about the concept, declaring it “nothing more than a shell game designed to conceal . . . the elimination of professional baseball in 42 communities across the country."
Talks began in March. MiLB sounded the alarm in October about MLB's proposal, which would affect mostly Single A and short season clubs, including the Lowell Spinners. Halem said on Tuesday that Lowell is not guaranteed to be on any list.

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee announced the next set of primary debates. One will be held in each of the early-voting states.
Democratic presidential candidates will debate four times in January and February as the party's opening quartet of nominating contests approaches, the Democratic National Committee said Thursday.
The committee laid out a packed schedule of debates, caucuses and primaries for early next year, announcing debates in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the first states to vote. In February alone, there will be seven days with marquee political events -- either debates or the contests themselves.
The party is facing the possibility of an unprecedented scheduling conflict: If President Trump is impeached, a Senate trial early in 2020 could force some of the candidates to stay in Washington.
"If a conflict with an impeachment trial is unavoidable, the D.N.C. will evaluate its options and work with all the candidates to accommodate them," the committee said in a statement.
The D.N.C. did not say Thursday how it would determine which candidates would qualify for the next set of debates. It has ratcheted up its polling and fund-raising standards for the six debates this year, beginning with a low threshold that resulted in 20 candidates qualifying for the first two debates and gradually raising the bar.
The debates announced on Thursday will be divided among familiar television networks, including ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC. But for the first time in the 2020 race, a pair of major technology companies signed on as sponsors, too. Apple News will co-host a debate in Manchester, N.H., on Feb. 7 with ABC News, and Twitter will partner with CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus for a Feb. 25 event in Charleston, S.C.
Absent from the sponsorship list was Facebook, whose role in allowing disinformation to proliferate in the 2016 race has been criticized by some leading Democrats.
The inclusion of Apple and Twitter could create an awkward dynamic for candidates who have made stricter regulation of the tech industry a component of their campaign platforms. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for instance, has called for Apple to be broken apart. And some candidates have faulted Twitter for what they see as lax policies toward political speech and unfounded rumors.
Moderators for the debates -- a plum assignment that can be the subject of much internal jockeying at TV networks -- have not yet been announced. The debate in Des Moines on Jan. 14 will be hosted by CNN and The Des Moines Register. NBC News, MSNBC and The Nevada Independent are hosting a Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas.
In a sign of intense interest in the presidential contest, all four of the early 2020 debates are scheduled for weeknights. In past election years, networks had sought to stage some debates on weekends, to avoid pre-empting lucrative prime-time programming. This time around, politics is a big television draw.
Viewership has been strong for this year's debates, with the first installment in June, a two-night event in Miami, seen by a record audience for a televised Democratic matchup. Since then, the ratings have waned, though network executives expect them to rebound as the critical early contests approach.
Only seven candidates are set to take the stage for a debate next Thursday in Los Angeles sponsored by PBS and Politico, the smallest lineup of 2019. An additional candidate, Senator Kamala Harris, had qualified but dropped out of the race last week.
The party's schedule for the first two months of 2020, including debates, primaries and caucuses, is here:
Tuesday, Jan. 14: A debate in Des Moines, hosted by CNN and The Des Moines Register at Drake University.
Monday, Feb. 3: The Iowa caucuses.
Friday, Feb. 7: A debate in Manchester, N.H., hosted by ABC News, WMUR and Apple News at St. Anselm College.
Tuesday, Feb. 11: The New Hampshire primary.
Wednesday, Feb. 19: A debate in Las Vegas, hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and The Nevada Independent.
Saturday, Feb. 22: The Nevada Democratic caucuses.
Tuesday, Feb. 25: A debate in Charleston, S.C., hosted by CBS News, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and Twitter at the Gaillard Center.
Saturday, Feb. 29: The South Carolina Democratic primary.

Texto completo: After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The proposed global legal accord has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several lawyers.
More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout — along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.
The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer's former studio, the Weinstein Company.
Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company's obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.
Meanwhile, Weinstein's bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million on Wednesday over allegations he violated his pretrial release conditions by mishandling or disabling his electronic ankle monitor.
Judge James Burke warned the disgraced movie mogul that he'll face jail if other issues crop up. Weinstein, 67, leaned on a walker as he came and went from a New York City courthouse for the bail hearing, looking as frail and pained as he did at a court appearance last week.
Weinstein's lawyer said he is having back surgery Thursday to relieve pain from an August car crash and that he will recover in time for the Jan. 6 start of his trial on rape and sexual assault charges.
Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.
More than $12 million — one-quarter of the overall settlement package — would go toward some, but not all, legal costs for Weinstein; his brother, Bob; and other former members of their company's board, the lawyers said. The board members would be insulated from future liability, and the alleged victims would drop their claims against Weinstein and other executives.
The settlement would resolve lawsuits filed by dozens of women since 2017, when The New York Times exposed allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Weinstein.
Although the producer's accusers include some of the highest-profile women in the entertainment world, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek, none have joined the proceedings.
A lawsuit by actress Ashley Judd, who has said she intends to take Weinstein to trial, would not be part of the deal.

Gracy Olmstead: Trump wants to take from the poor and give to the wealthy

Texto completo: The Trump administration is highly selective in how it applies the standard of “self-sufficiency” for programs. To move food stamp beneficiaries toward that goal in all states, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue laid out a plan to strengthen work requirements for federal beneficiaries by April 2020.
The new rule makes it more difficult for states, no matter if they have areas of economic distress, to waive a requirement that able-bodied adults work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamp) benefits. The new measure could eliminate benefits for nearly 700,000 adults (it would not affect food stamp recipients with dependents, those over age 50, those with a disability or pregnant women).
“Government dependency has never been the American dream,” Mr. Perdue said. “We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand.”
But Republican distaste for “government handouts” seems to be strictly on a case-by-case basis. For example, with the Farm Bill, Mr. Perdue and others within the party are quite comfortable turning a blind eye to corporate welfare and crony capitalism. And “handouts” — or if you prefer, “bailouts” — to wealthy agribusinesses are not limited to the Farm Bill. Over the past year, as farmers throughout America were hit hard by President Trump’s trade wars, the administration put together a $28 billion package that, according to some reports, could actually be overpaying some farmers for their losses.
The list goes on. Last year, House Republicans wanted to make it possible for 10 percent or more of the nation’s commodity farms to receive unlimited subsidy payments. They sought to remove payment limitations from marketing assistance loan gains and loan-deficiency payments and tried to make it easier for general partnerships to reorganize as “family farms” and thus qualify for greater subsidy payments. The House version of the Farm Bill also exempted certain business arrangements — partnerships, joint ventures, LLCs and Subchapter S corporations — from the adjusted gross income means-testing provision, a measure that has so far limited commodity and conservation payments to the nation’s wealthiest producers.
To be sure, the struggles of many farmers across the country are real and troubling, but the farm bailout’s aid payments are not getting to some truly struggling farms. The Environmental Working Group found that most bailout money has gone to the nation’s biggest farms. One farm has received $2.8 million in payments. With the aid they’ve received from the Trump administration this year, some farmers will net their highest profits in six years.
In essence, the Trump administration’s measures are aimed at making it easier for wealthy Americans to receive unlimited government handouts — to, in the words of Mr. Perdue, secure for themselves an “indefinitely giving hand.”
Ever since the New Deal, the farm-focused portion of the Farm Bill has been geared toward providing economic aid to farmers — and both farmers and Congress have “clearly moved away from the Jeffersonian ideal that championed minimal government and maximum personal independence,” as R. Douglas Hurt writes in his book “Problems of Plenty.” Farm Bill subsidy recipients are often deeply dependent on the federal government for support.
Yet rather than speaking of this as laziness, or bemoaning the burden this causes for taxpayers, Mr. Perdue and others within the administration bolster supports for the nation’s largest, wealthiest agricultural producers.
This is not to suggest that there is no need in rural America for investment, reform and assistance. Many farm communities are hurting, but very few federal dollars go to the small to midsize farmers who actually need assistance. About 75 percent of total subsidy payments go to the largest 10 percent of farming companies. Agribusiness monopolies eat away at farmers’ profit, from the seeds they grow to the chemicals they buy to the supply chain that gets their product to market. Tens of thousands of farms have gone under in recent years, and farmer suicides are alarmingly high. The opioid crisis is as intense in farm country as it is in other geographic areas, and many parts of rural America are plagued with the same “food deserts” that plague many urban neighborhoods.
Mr. Perdue isn’t wrong when he says that the American dream does not consist of government dependency. But utter self-sufficiency is, if we are honest, impossible for most of us. People will always need a “safety net” of sorts — but ideally, we should want people to find that support in community, family, churches and associations, as well as other local ties, not (or at least not only) through a distant government bureaucracy.
That said, at a time when many local social threads have broken, and our society is increasingly fragmented and frayed, there is a need for the government to provide support where no other support is available.
Mr. Perdue and others in Washington assume that stringent work requirements will push food stamp recipients to find the number of working hours necessary for eligibility. They suggest, without saying so explicitly, that any unemployment currently experienced by these beneficiaries is because of laziness, not lack of opportunity.
But many people in both rural and urban areas of America know that reality is a lot messier than this. Available work is not distributed evenly over every state or region. Threatening to take away someone’s food stamps until they find steady work does nothing to solve the problems of postindustrial collapse, community breakdown, economic inequality, racism, systemic poverty, homelessness or drug addiction that have prompted many to find help in the first place — just as a farm bailout does nothing to repair the economic, cultural and political conditions that are feeding our current farm crisis.
But as farmers’ plight has grown, they’ve been offered the “indefinitely giving hand” that Mr. Perdue does not want food stamp recipients to receive. It seems hypocritical to demand that the poorest Americans pull themselves up by their bootstraps while covering the business risk of the nation’s wealthiest agribusinesses.
So if Mr. Perdue and the Trump administration want to foster fiscal self-sufficiency, perhaps — rather than starting with Americans struggling to put food on their table — they should start at the top of the food chain instead.

Townshend, Daltrey return to The Who's rocking ways

Texto completo: WHO

The Who (Interscope)

While frequently joining forces for tours and other projects, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey have released just two studio albums as The Who since 1982, with 2006's Endless Wire their last such work until now.

WHO sees the pair backed by some of their frequent collaborators since the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1979 and bassist John Entwistle in 2002, such as drummer Zak Starkey and bassist Pino Palladino. Others include drummers Joey Waronker and Carla Azar, bassist Gus Seyffert, and keyboard player Benmont Tench.

Still, all the splendid backing notwithstanding - and not forgetting co-producer and multi-instrumentalist D. Sardy, either - it's the high standards of The Who's last remaining trademarks, Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing, that make the album such a joy.

Townshend has written a strong batch of songs full of yearning and confronting the passage of time, many carrying shades and echoes of his past work; he rips power chords and performs slinky riffs; and his vocals, especially in support of Daltrey's leads, are still a highlight.

Daltrey, for his part, with health concerns behind him, sings with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades.

While it doesn't have the same of air of finality as Leonard Cohen's You Want It Darker, released just weeks before his death in 2016, based on their recording habits of the past decades, WHO may well be their last studio album.

The catchy, propulsive opener All This Music Must Fade seems like a message about Townshend and Daltrey's difficult relationship, even though that seems to have mellowed: I don't care/I know you're gonna hate this song. And that's it/We never really got along. It may also be a missive to their fans and closes with what will become Townshend's most famous last words since his I saw ya! at the end of Magic Bus.

Ball and Chain, Street Song, and Beads on One String are topical but many other of the 11 tracks (plus three on the deluxe edition) are simultaneously defiant, vulnerable and contemplative, with aging repeatedly rearing its head.

On the rousing Rocking in Rage, like a coda to Quadrophenia, the talk is still about their generation: I thought I'd be calmer/Not rocking in rage, even if I'm too old to fight. It's a shiver-inducing Daltrey performance.

Townshend sings lead on I'll Be Back, a nostalgic tune with strings and harmonica, that seems lifted from his All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes 1982 solo album.

On I Don't Wanna Get Wise, Daltrey seems to have changed some of the lyric sheet's I pronouns into he, we and us, as if making space for himself in the rocking mini-biography of a song - He was drunk/I was blind/Though we tried to be kind - and belting out a We got wise at the end.

Thankfully, it's much too late for Daltrey and Townshend to die before they get old, so with WHO they show that even in rock 'n' roll, it's possible to age both with grace and vigor and without abandoning purpose. Or lose the talent to make stirring, highly gratifying music.

MUNICH 2016

Keith Jarrett (ECM)

He's played with many of the greatest musicians in jazz history, starting with trumpeter Miles Davis. But when master jazz piano improvisationist Keith Jarrett gives a solo performance, there's something to behold.

Few, if any, pianists of the jazz-classical genres can match his intensity, creativity, and unstoppable ideas. Hardly any pianist has ever improvised like him. Munich 2016 is a must-have for Jarrett fans like me. Recorded at Munich's Philharmonic Hall on July 16, 2016, Munich 2016 was the final show of his European tour back then.

It's a bit of a mix between high-octane, almost frenetic scoots along the keyboard and warm, soothing, and thought-provoking numbers that awaken your soul. On my first listen, I actually found some of the early parts of this two-disc album to be a little more dour than I had expected, but was pleased by what happened after that. I'm a particular sucker for his gorgeous, jazz-classical rendition of Over the Rainbow, which many artists - including Jarrett - have performed before, but his offers an intense beauty of that classic song that sticks to your bones and stands on its own.

Jarrett, like a lot of great jazz improvisers, is a bit of an acquired taste. I fell in love with his music in high school upon discovering The Koln Concert after it took the world by storm following its release in 1975, lauded by the New York Times and others as the best album released that year, bar none. The Koln Concert went on to become the best-selling piano recording in history, and it opened my ears to the power that solo jazz improvisationists have at achieving interpersonal communication with listeners, especially behind a piano.

I've continued to follow Jarrett, who - now 74 - rarely performs. He was afflicted so deeply by chronic fatigue syndrome two decades ago that he took two years off and it was unclear if he would perform again. Then, in March of 2018, he canceled all remaining concerts of his worldwide tour that year because of unexplained health issues, including a much-anticipated solo concert at New York's Carnegie Hall. He's in a class of his own and I'm pulling for him.

Texto completo: Since its founding, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP has largely been associated with one person: famed litigator David Boies.
Now, the firm Mr. Boies co-founded in the 1990s is implementing a plan to ensure it can survive long past his tenure.
Boies Schiller this week named for the first time managing partners who don't have their names on the door. The two new leaders, New York-based Nicholas Gravante Jr. and London-based Natasha Harrison, have been tapped to guide the firm into its second generation.
The announcement comes after a tumultuous period for Mr. Boies. He's most recently been in the news for filing a defamation lawsuit against longtime foe Alan Dershowitz and for his interactions , as reported in the New York Times, with an apparent fraudster who said he had damning materials related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
He has also come under heat for his representation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of sexual assault, and for his support of now-defunct blood-testing company Theranos Inc.
The bad press has led some clients to tell partners they are wary of giving new work to the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. The new leaders pushed back against that notion.
The headlines have been "temporary distractions," Mr. Gravante said, but he added that they aren't the driving force behind the transition. Instead, the changes are about preparing the 320-lawyer firm for the eventual retirements of Mr. Boies, 78, and fellow name partner Jonathan Schiller, 73.
"What you need is a willingness from them to hand it over," Ms. Harrison said.
Successfully moving a law firm away from its founders is a challenge that has vexed other partnerships in recent years . Mr. Boies has long been one of the primary sources of revenue for Boies Schiller and his name is well known beyond legal circles.
"I am confident that building on what we as a firm do very well, and learning from our mistakes, mine included, that the next generation of leadership will not only equal but will exceed what we have accomplished to date," Mr. Boies said.
He rose to fame over the decades for assignments including his successful representation of the Justice Department in an antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp., representing Al Gore in the 2000 Florida presidential election recount and helping win same-sex marriage rights in California.
Mr. Boies said he has been working for the past decade on the best way to hand off the litigation firm he founded in 1997. Last year, he and Mr. Schiller ceded some power to a new four-person management committee that took on many day-to-day operations.
The slow-moving transition, spearheaded by Messrs. Boies and Schiller, has frustrated some partners internally, according to a person familiar with the matter.

But both Mr. Gravante, 59, and Ms. Harrison, 46, say there are no internal calls among the partners to push Mr. Boies aside. Mr. Boies reiterated that point in an interview and said he and Mr. Schiller plan to retire over the next several years.
"I don't see any indication of any turmoil in the firm," Mr. Boies said.
Boies Schiller's partners will vote on the appointment of the new managing partners this weekend at the firm's annual meeting in Key Biscayne, Fla., a lavish affair open to all lawyers at the firm and their families. The vote isn't expected to be contentious, as partners usually fall in line with recommendations from the 11-person executive committee, which has blessed the new leaders.
Mr. Gravante, who first began working with Mr. Boies in 1985 when the two were at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, has represented a host of high-profile clients, including former American International Group Inc. head Hank Greenberg, the family of former Vice President Joe Biden and the Andy Warhol Foundation.
He has inspired some of his own colorful headlines. In 2016 he sued his mother in a dispute related to assets of his father, Nicholas Gravante Sr., who was longtime counsel to Brooklyn mafia families.
Ms. Harrison, meanwhile, joined the firm six years ago to start a London office, its first international venture. She represents investment banks, private equity and hedge funds and corporations in international disputes.
In his new role, Mr. Gravante said he would be focused on what needs to change to make the firm relevant going forward. When he joined in 2000, he says, "We were a very different firm. It was David Boies responsible for the lion's share of the work." The firm's system of compensating partners still reflects that, he said, focusing too much on the number of hours worked and not enough on making sure partners are hustling for new business.
Since 2013, the percentage of the firm's business generated by the named partners has declined from slightly over 40% to just over 20%. But Mr. Gravante said the firm's system of compensating partners still focuses too much on the number of hours worked and not enough on making sure partners are hustling for new business.
The firm continues to be a lucrative place to work, particularly for those who succeed in court for their clients. One associate found out this week they are in line for a $950,000 bonus tied to a contingency-fee case, Mr. Boies said. Partners with equity in the firm made an average $3.3 million last year, according to legal trade publication the American Lawyer.

Texto completo: The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.
ST. PETERSBURG — They came to the cream-colored house in south St. Petersburg this week with flowers, cards and aching hearts.
First came U.S. Navy chief recruiter Michael Martin, who signed "Mo" Mohammed Haitham up for the military over a year before. Haitham is the long-legged track and field star at Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg who has been in the news all week about last Friday's shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola.
Martin came in full uniform with a bundle of flowers. He removed his cap as he approached the empty driveway. He knocked. No one was home.
"When you join the military, you join a family," Martin told a stranger from his car window. "He was someone you could tell had a heart, and I wanted to let his family know what we saw in him."
Martin's car disappeared down the empty road. It wasn't long before Ashley Williams pulled up. Williams has also been in the news all week, talking about her cousin.
Williams is the one who told the radio reporters about her cousin's smile, his sense of humor — how, after graduating last year, Haitham joined the military. She's the one who told newspaper reporters about how he went through boot camp in Illinois and was assigned to a flight crew training in Pensacola. How on Thanksgiving, he surprised his family in St. Petersburg. He didn't look the same.
"He looked grown up," said Ashley Williams, who was more like a sibling than a cousin. "He looked happy. Jumping out of airplanes is something he dreamed of doing."
Haitham is dead now, one of three victims of Friday's shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola.
"We're a big family," said Williams. "He left a huge hole."
Haitham was the middle child of three children of Evelyn Brady, a 20-year Navy veteran. His family moved to St. Petersburg from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
In many ways, he was following in his mother's footsteps and "wanted to help people," said Linda Davis, who lives next door.
"He was the sweet one," Davis said.
The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.
Joshua Kaled Watson. Watson was a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Navy Academy. Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, of Richmond Hill, Georgia, was also killed. He was 21.
The shooting began Friday morning when an aviation student from Saudi Arabia opened fire in a classroom, wounding another eight people. The shooting prompted a massive law enforcement response and base lockdown. It ended when a sheriff's deputy killed the shooter.
St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman tweeted that he hopes Haitham's family finds "peace in knowing that Mo made our community and world better."
Lakewood High School's football team took to Facebook to commend Haitman for his courage and heroism.
Principal Erin Savage said at a press conference on Monday that Haitham was nicknamed "the perfect one" and was beloved by students and faculty.
Haitham was a good student, a track and cross country star and a basketball player who also helped manage the girls' basketball team.
"When you picture Mohammed, you picture a smile," said Savage, who learned of the shooting on Saturday. "I just kept picturing his face, with a gunman pointing a gun at him and that initial shock and fear. As a mother, that is what took my breath away."
Tobias Ryckis, 18, a friend and fellow trackmate, said Haitham "had this personality — big smile. People would always gravitate toward him. But he was also a stick-up-for-the-little-guy kinda guy."
Ryckis' was bullied during freshman year at Lakewood High School. It didn't take long for Haitham to take notice — and intervene.
"Mo stuck up for me," Ryckis said. "He talked to them and they stopped. That was the kind of guy he was."
After leaving Lakewood High School, Ryckis found himself in Panama City, two hours from where Haitham was stationed. They promised to see each other after he finished basic training.
Airman Haitham's commanding officer told his father, Sameh Haitham, that his son had also tried to take down the gunman, the New York Times reported Monday.
"That was the type of person Mo was," Ryckis said of Haitham. "When things got tough, he always wanted to be sure that he put other people's interests ahead of his own."
The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.

Attack leaves Jewish community terrified

Texto completo: Orthodox Jews are horrified and fearful in the wake of Tuesday's attack on a Jersey City kosher store.
The fierce gun battle through the city streets left six people dead, including a police detective, the store's owner, and the two suspects.
In response, state and local leaders said they will increase police patrols in vulnerable areas, as fears of copycat attacks rise.
Jewish leaders and others have warned that months of physical and verbal assaults on Hasidic and other ultra-Orthodox Jews in the New York-New Jersey region could lead to killings.
"The latest reports that a suspect involved in the Jersey City attack had published anti-Semitic posts online and that investigators believe the attack was motivated by these sentiments are frightening," said Allen Fagin, the executive vice president of the Orthodox Union.
"Anti-Semitism has always been a torment that Jews have been forced to reckon with for centuries," he continued. "However, its resurgence both in the United States and abroad is alarming for a new reason: the degree to which the mainstream of civil society has seemingly tolerated, without loud and sustained outcry, the most blatant acts of intolerance."
Jersey City has seen a migration from Brooklyn of Chabad Lubavitch Jews and Satmar Hasidim. The families moved into what's viewed as a predominantly non-white neighborhood, establishing businesses, schools and synagogues.
Rivkie Feiner, a lifelong Monsey resident, said the expanding Jersey City Orthodox community was well-known.
"I've heard about them," she said. "That it is a really lovely community."
Authorities continue to probe Tuesday's killing spree that saw hundreds of shots fired along the streets. Police have said that after killing 15-year-veteran Jersey City police officer Joe Seals at a local cemetery, two shooters attacked a kosher market, located near a synagogue with a private school. The New York Times has reported that one of the two suspects was tied to the extremist Black Hebrew Israelites group and had published anti-Semitic and anti-police writings.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said the gunmen targeted the Jewish community.
Feiner called on Rockland government and law enforcement officials to ramp up security in Jewish spaces.
"Even though we are in a state over, we are horrified and frightened," she said. "I call on them to do whatever they can to make use feel safe because right now we don't feel that."
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on state police to increase patrols at synagogues and Jewish establishments.
Rockland Sheriff Louis Falco said communities will see increased police presence as he is working with Ramapo, Spring Valley, and Clarkstown police departments. Rockland features a large Jewish population, including Orthodox and Hasidic communities in Ramapo and Spring Valley, as well as more cultural institutions like the JCC and Jewish Federation.
Across the border and north of Jersey City, Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton said he is ordering increased patrol at synagogues and surrounding population centers.
While there is no specific or credible threat at this time, the office is operating on heightened alert and is working cooperatively with local law enforcement to ensure the safety of Bergen County residents. The Sheriff's Office reminds residents to report any and all suspicious activity to law enforcement.
Copycat fears mount Falco said he's concerned about copycat attacks and he's been in contract with law enforcement in New York City and New Jersey.
"We're monitoring everything closely," he said. "I've been getting intel briefings. We do have some concerns and we will be putting out extra patrols along with the Ramapo, Spring Valley and Clarkstown police for the foreseeable future."
Rockland has been a hotbed of strong rhetoric against Hasidic Jews and Ramapo politics, including exchanges of videos citing anti-Semitism and claims the communities are looking to take control of the county, violating zoning and ripping off social services and other government programs.
Bassie Friedman said her family's synagogue, Cheder Chabad of Monsey, had previously stepped up security, as had her daughter's school. She said she talks to her children about safety, "but not excessively. We talk more about, what are we going to do positive, how are we going to make someone smile."
The fears that this was yet another anti-Semitic attack shook Friedman, but the Pomona resident said that education and interaction are key.
"You light a candle it illuminates the entire room," she said. "We'll always have people who hate. For the rest of us who don't want to live in a world like that, just bring more light. I don't think you can ever go wrong focusing on the positive."
Rabbi Shmuel Gancz of the Chabad Jewish Center of Suffern said he knows the rabbi, Moshe Schapiro, who is the Chabad leader in Jersey City and Hoboken. Chabad practices outreach with others in the Jewish and non-Jewish communities.
Gancz said his biggest fear is that such violence could happen in Rockland, where the Jewish community is much stronger and influential than in Jersey City.
He said the gentrification of Jersey City, started decades ago, has continued with the influx of Orthodox Jews. He said he sees and hears the argument that there's a loss of housing and rents have increased, angering people.
"Seems, if you are not happy with your neighbor and can't fight in town hall, you fight with a gun," Gancz said.
Gancz said self-interest by all sides is a problem, it's about voting blocs, taxes, housing or business. But he said the answer is for all community members to work together.
"All people have selfish lifestyles, he said. "The over-arching idea as human beings is we need to find ways to unify and connect with our neighbors. We are all sharing the same universe and have to respect each other."
Ramapo Supervisor Michael Specht said the attacks and killings highlight "the tremendous sacrifice and commitment our men and women in the law enforcement community make every single day and we stand in solidarity with the department and their families."
He said Ramapo police will increase patrols.

5 essential pieces of gear for runners

Texto completo: Sometimes a little help goes a long way.
I learned this in running after making a lot of mistakes. For instance, I thought at one time it would be fine if I ran in shoes with hundreds, if not thousands, of miles on them.
I also convinced myself it was OK to not pack a snack while running for a couple hours. Hunger, it seemed, was a distraction not worth feeding.
But in the last two years, I've realized that running without any gear or aid doesn't lead one to success. Now I won't leave my apartment to run without taking a few essential items with me.
From good running shoes to a belt, there are several pieces of gear that I find essential when running alone or with friends.
If you're running for the first time or getting back into the sport, here are five things worth having.
Good shoes One of the most important things a runner can do is to use a good pair of shoes that aren't worn out or damaged.
Running shoes, according to Livestrong, can provide midsole foot cushioning and arch support.
Proper foot cushioning can reduce the physical stresses on the heel, ankle and toes, in addition to alleviating or preventing knee, hip and back pain, according to the site.
There are numerous other benefits with running shoes, but the main point is that it can help your body avoid some injuries.
Since the only thing between you and the road is your shoes, consider investing in a good pair.
Headlamp, reflectors Running in an area away from cars like a park or trail is an extraordinarily fun and freeing experience.
But for many runners, sometimes the best and easiest option is to run in more congested areas or while it's dark.
For those running in the early morning or at night, it's worth investing in a headlamp or reflective visit to increase one's visibility.
Many headlamps can be programmed to shine a bright light or blink every few seconds. There are also reflective and LED vests.
Whether it's necessary or you simply want to be extra cautious, investing in a device to make you more visible to cars and pedestrians isn't a bad idea.
Belt It's hard to fit everything into the pocket of your running shorts.
Belts are a great way to keep your favorite items out of your pockets and hands. Many hide beneath one's shirt and have ample storage.
They're also great trash receptacles when a trash bin isn't to be found.
Identification Whether it's an ID bracelet or driver's license tucked into your belt, it's important to have some form of ID in case of an accident.
This is especially important for those running alone. In the event of a medical emergency or collision with a vehicle, it's vital that those who find you are aware of who you are and the best emergency contact info.
Food Runners who prefer short distances rarely need to eat while exercising.
But for those running long distances, eating on the run is crucial.
In a massive New York Times series on running and eating, author Jen A. Miller says runners should eat and drink every four miles.
"If this leaves you feeling sapped, sick or both, try eating more often or try to eat a little more each time," she writes.
Bananas or pre-packaged sports gels or energy chews are great options that can easily be stored in a pocket or belt.

Texto completo: Taylor Lorenz, who writes about internet culture, explains how she keeps her finger on the pulse.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Taylor Lorenz, an internet culture reporter, discussed the tech she's using.
You often write about what young people are doing with tech. (O.K. boomer !) What tools do you use to keep your finger on the pulse?
I spend a lot of time on social media. I'm on Twitter pretty consistently throughout the day to keep up with breaking news and what people are talking about. I also spend a great deal of time on Instagram and YouTube.
On Instagram, I create tons of boards of different things I come across on the Explore tab that I think are interesting. I have several Instagram accounts just for lurking. On YouTube I watch a lot of YouTuber vlogs, recap shows including Philip DeFranco's and drama/tea channels to keep up with the stuff people are talking about.
I'm in a lot of Telegram groups and Discord servers for different meme pages and influencers. I also spend time in Facebook groups about celebrity news and pop culture. My favorite podcast is "Who? Weekly," and I've gotten tips on stories from its Facebook group. Before I go to bed, I usually spend an hour (or more) on TikTok.
In addition to social media, I subscribe to a bunch of great newsletters that help keep me in the loop on things I may have missed. I love Casey Newton's The Interface and this automated one I get of the top links from Hacker News. I am a big Business Insider reader, and it just started a newsletter about the business of the influencer world, which I'm excited about.
I also cruise around a site called Product Hunt every week or so to check out new apps and platforms. I'll sign up for pretty much anything with a login page, and I love talking to product people about what they're building, so Product Hunt is great for finding people like that. It's also just a great community.
So that's how you stay on top of what young people are doing?
One thing I never, ever do is start with the premise "What are young people doing?" I always start with an interesting user behavior, or trend, or meme I see emerging, and look at why it's being expressed in a certain way or how it evolved.
For instance, I would never ask, "What new memes are middle schoolers sharing?" But I might observe a new meme format emerging on Instagram Explore, like niche memes, then interview people on what it is about that particular format that allows them to express themselves in a better way, or what emotions it allows them to communicate better, or what tools they're using and how they could be improved. The fact that mostly middle and high schoolers are the ones sharing niche memes is relevant, but somewhat secondary.
I also don't think young people are the only ones using the internet in new, interesting and creative ways. Probably because I'm in my 30s, I've been really interested lately in the ways parents use tech to connect with one another and just generally parent culture online. For instance, I recently wrote about how pineapples became a meme in the world of in vitro fertilization, and the struggles of parenting a teenage social media star.
What do you do with TikTok?
Honestly, the videos on there are hilarious and super addicting. What you do is essentially sit and watch an endless stream of entertaining videos until you get tired. TikTok also has commenting, messaging and live streaming, so you can engage in those aspects of the app as well.
Part of what makes TikTok so compelling is the "For You" page, which the app opens on. TikTok uses artificial intelligence to anticipate what type of videos you're most likely to engage with, and feeds you a steady stream of that content. This technology has been so effective that the app's owner, Bytedance, a Chinese tech conglomerate, was forced to introduce anti-addiction measures in the Chinese version of the app.
What is the most annoying internet trend?
I'm not sure if this counts as a trend, but I would say the harassment that I and many women in particular deal with online, especially on Twitter, is the most annoying thing.
I believe it's directly tied to the broader trend of people spending more time in closed, moderated spaces, like Facebook groups, group chats, subreddits and so on. I think that shift is a natural consequence of these large, open social networks' failure to create a safer experience for their users.
When you're not working, what tech are you obsessed with?
I don't ever have the latest gadget or iPhone, and my apartment is largely devoid of tech aside from my Apple TV.
I did recently re-buy an old-school Tamagotchi. I kind of wanted to take care of something and I can't get a pet, so I raised a couple of little Tamagotchi animals for a few weeks, which was fun. I feel like there's a big trend around nostalgia tech right now. I got the idea to buy a Tamagotchi from YouTube.
Aside from that, I don't really use tech if I'm fully off the clock. I like to spend time outside or watching horror movies. I watch three or four horror movies a week, and I love Shudder, which is like a horror-only Netflix. It's pretty much the only time I don't check my phone.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, his former associates, insurers and accusers have reached a nearly $47 million tentative settlement of almost all the civil cases pending against him, about $25 million of which will compensate women who have accused the Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct, according to people familiar with the matter.
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Weinstein and his former associates, including board members of his former studio, didn't admit wrongdoing, the people said. The deal still needs to be approved by a bankruptcy judge and a judge overseeing a proposed class-action lawsuit. The bulk of the settlement money will be paid by insurance policies, including those held by his former studio, Weinstein Co., some of the people said.
The deal resolves all but two of the civil sexual-misconduct lawsuits and other legal claims filed against Mr. Weinstein, the people said.
The tentative settlement won't affect the criminal case brought by Manhattan prosecutors, which is set to go to trial on Jan. 6. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
The settlement is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations , which involved lawyers for Mr. Weinstein, his former film studio, the New York attorney general's office, insurers and Mr. Weinstein's accusers. The negotiations also included the former associates of Mr. Weinstein who some women claimed had enabled Mr. Weinstein's alleged abuse. It also resolves a suit filed by the New York attorney general that accused his former studio's executives and board of failing to protect women from his alleged misconduct.
Under the terms of the deal, about $6 million will go to women who have filed lawsuits and legal claims and their attorneys, the people said. An additional $18.6 million will be set aside to create a settlement fund for additional alleged victims, including those covered by the attorney general's suit, they said.
About $7 million will go to some creditors of the film studio. About $12 million will cover the costs of lawyers who defended Mr. Weinstein's former associates against the suits.
The tentative deal was reported earlier by the New York Times.

A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general and a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment.
Elizabeth Fegan, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the proposed class-action suit, said because the settlement wasn't final she couldn't discuss specifics. "We've fought to forge a meaningful settlement against strong headwinds," Ms. Fegan said in a statement. "And no matter what amount of money the survivors ultimately receive, the civil settlement will do little to reverse the damage Weinstein caused to so many."
Of the total settlement, $1 million will fund Mr. Weinstein's defense costs to fight the lawsuits against two alleged victims who aren't participating in the settlement, the people said.
Lawyers for those women have portrayed the settlement as unfair. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for one of those women, said in a statement that he didn't believe the deal was the best possible settlement. "It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein," he said.
Thomas Giuffra, a lawyer for the second woman who rejected the deal, objected to settlement funds paying the legal bills of Mr. Weinstein's former associates.
"Victims will receive only a small fraction of what the settlement was expected to yield," he said.

Texto completo: Durante varios días, se han visto palomas multicolores con sombrero de vaquero pavoneándose en las calles de Las Vegas. Nadie sabe quién equipa a los pájaros, según publica The Washington Post.
El residente de Las Vegas, Bobby Lee, subió a Facebook un video de dos pájaros con sombreros en miniatura, uno rojo y otro rosado, la semana pasada en Facebook . Los “pájaros tienen sombreros, hermano”, exclama en el clip. La publicación, que se compartió ampliamente, rápidamente se hizo viral en Internet y llegó a Mariah Hillman, cofundadora de un rescate local de palomas llamado Lofty Hopes.
Hillman, de 47 años, y la búsqueda de las aves de su hija de 30 años despegaron rápidamente. Comenzaron investigando áreas conocidas, donde repartieron tarjetas de visita y les dijeron a los transeúntes: “Si las ves, aliméntalas. Estamos a solo tres millas de distancia y podemos llegar bastante rápido “.
I finally found one!!! @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/j2u90R2esL
— ???????? ♥????‍♀️ (@kassandraqueenn) December 9, 2019
Desde entonces, Hillman le dijo a The Washington Post, el dúo recibió dos pistas cada día de personas que vieron las palomas, a menudo adjuntando pruebas de video.
Hillman estaba en casa, limpiando jaulas de pájaros, cuando se enteró por primera vez de un avistamiento. Era demasiado tarde para ir a verlo, pero a la mañana siguiente, tan pronto como Hillman entró en la urbanización cerrada, vio la paloma con sombrero rojo, encaramada a la derecha. Ella desaceleró su auto y dijo: “Hola compañero”.
“Estaba sacudiendo la cabeza, tratando de quitarse el sombrero. Definitivamente es pegamento “, le dijo a The Post sobre el adhesivo utilizado en el pájaro. “Tenemos que mudarlo, lo que llevará tiempo”.
Hillman continuó: “Lo único que no los dañaría es el petróleo, que luego lo convierte en una paloma grasa, como los que están alrededor de McDonalds”.
De cualquier manera, la paloma debe quedarse con Hillman por un tiempo. Durante la persecución de dos horas, la exactivista por los derechos de los animales vio un halcón que rodeaba el área, al que llamó “preocupado”.
El misterio permanece
Aunque la gente ha especulado que los sombreros se originaron con un asistente del Rodeo de las Finales Nacionales, que actualmente se lleva a cabo en la ciudad, la asociación ha negado su participación, según The New York Times, y el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana de Las Vegas dijo que “no parece ser un asunto policial “.
Por ahora, Hillman se centra en localizar a las aves y garantizar su seguridad. Hasta ahora, ella y su hija acogieron a Cluck Norris, que luce un sombrero rojo de vaquero, y Coo-lamity James, que usa uno rosa. Otros avistadores mencionaron pájaros con gorras grises y marrones, aunque Hillman aún no los ha encontrado.
El New York Times entrevistó a un ornitólogo de la Universidad de Cornell, Charles Walcott, que se especializa en palomas. “Disfruté el video”, dijo Walcott al Times. “Solo pensé que esas palomas con sombreros eran lindas”.
Walcott también dijo que no está preocupado por las palomas, que actúan con bastante normalidad y no parecen estar angustiados. Los sombreros son “ciertamente lo suficientemente ligeros”, dijo al Times. “A mí me parecen palomas felices. Es difícil saberlo, por supuesto, porque no nos hablarán”.
Las palomas, dijo Hillman, tienen mucho para ellos: se aparean de por vida, los machos y las hembras producen leche y alimentan a sus crías, pueden vivir hasta 20 años en una unidad familiar, y son una de las diez especies que pueden reconocerse en un espejo.
“Son una gran primera mascota”, agregó, y señaló que tienen picos flexibles y no agudos. “Cuando necesitábamos palomas durante la guerra, eran considerados héroes. Ahora que no los necesitamos, se han convertido en alimañas o plagas. Hacemos eso con muchas cosas en esta sociedad, y eso no está bien”. (Editado por Pelayo Escandón)

BURGER BATTLE

Texto completo: The meat industry has a warning for consumers: Beware of plant-based meat.
That is the message behind a marketing campaign by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a public relations firm whose financial supporters have included meat producers and others in the food industry. In recent weeks the group has placed full-page ads in The New York Times and other newspapers raising health concerns about plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, which are designed to look, taste and even appear to bleed like real meat.
The ads call them “ultra-processed imitations” with numerous ingredients. “What’s hiding in your plant-based meat?” asks one ad featuring a sad face made of two patties and sausage. Another directs readers to a site that compares plant-based burgers to dog food. In November, the group’s managing director, Will Coggin, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today that labeled fake meats as ultra-processed foods that can spur weight gain, although the research on processed foods has not included plant-based meats. A few days later, the center’s executive director, Rick Berman, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal criticizing plant-based meats as highly processed and no healthier than meat. Its headline: “ ‘Plant-Based Meat’ Is All Hat and No Cattle.”
Kind of an endorsement
Impossible Foods, which makes a popular plant-based burger, said the campaign was misleading and fearmongering. The company says plant-based meat alternatives are better for consumers and better for the planet, requiring less land and water and producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat from cattle. The new “disinformation” campaign, they say, is a sign that Impossible Foods’ mission - to disrupt the meat industry and replace animals in the food system - is working. “It’s a point of pride to have that organization come after us,” said Pat Brown, the company’s chief executive. “It’s hard to imagine a stronger endorsement.” (The Center for Consumer Freedom did not respond to requests for an interview.)
Unlike other vegetarian meat substitutes, the new plant-based burgers are winning over meat lovers. Market research firm NPD Group says that 90% of the customers purchasing them are meat eaters who believe the products are more healthful and better for the environment, said Darren Seifer, an analyst at NPD, which recently predicted that plant-based meats will have staying power because of their popularity with millennials.
“The two big brands, Beyond and Impossible, have replicated the burger experience without having to sacrifice the taste of the burger,” he said. “So now a lot of consumers feel like they have a healthier option, they are reducing the amount of meat they consume, and they just feel better about that.”
But are plant-based meats really better for you than meat? It depends on how you eat them, said Dr. Frank Hu, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Replacing a hamburger with a plant burger is not an improvement in diet quality if you chase it with french fries and a sugar-laden soda, Hu said.
For consumers trying to choose the healthiest option, Hu said studies comparing the metabolic effects of eating beef burgers versus plant burgers are currently underway. In the meantime, he considers the meat substitutes “transitional foods” for people who are trying to adopt more healthful diets.
Room for study
In August, Hu, along with a group of health and climate experts, published a report in JAMA that explored whether plant-based meats can be part of a “healthy low-carbon diet.” Studies show that replacing red meat with nuts, legumes and other plant foods can lower mortality and chronic disease risk, but it’s not possible to extrapolate that processed burgers made with purified soy or pea protein will have the same health benefits, Hu said.
Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat say the building blocks of their burgers are plants. The Beyond Burger has about 18 ingredients, including purified pea protein, coconut and canola oils, rice protein, potato starch and beet juice extract for coloring. Beyond Meat says it uses no genetically modified or artificially produced ingredients.
The Impossible Burger is made with similar basic ingredients, but it gets its protein largely from soy and potato, and it uses an iron-containing compound from soy called heme to enhance the burger’s meaty flavor. Both products use methylcellulose, a plant derivative commonly used in sauces and ice cream, as a binder.
Compared to a beef patty, the Impossible and Beyond burgers have similar amounts of protein and calories, with less saturated fat and no cholesterol. They also contain fiber; real meat does not. But compared to real beef, the two plant-based burgers are considerably higher in sodium, containing about 16% of the recommended daily value. An uncooked 4-ounce beef patty has about 75 milligrams of sodium, compared to 370 milligrams of sodium in the Impossible Burger and 390 milligrams in the Beyond Burger.
This fall, Burger King said it had its most successful quarter in four years, driven by sales of its plant-based Impossible Whopper. Dunkin’ Donuts announced it was rolling out a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Meat sausages in 9,000 of its stores after a successful trial run in New York City. More than 50,000 grocery stores and restaurants, including fast-food chains like Subway, White Castle, KFC and Carl’s Jr., carry products from Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.
Despite the popularity of plant-based burgers, beef burgers are still overwhelmingly the more popular choice at restaurants. Americans purchased 6.4 billion beef burgers at quick-service restaurants during the 12 months that ended in May, compared to 228 million plant-based burgers in the same period.
While meat consumption in America is at an all-time high, many Americans have shifted from eating beef to poultry. In the past three decades, beef intake has fallen by about a third, while chicken intake has more than doubled, and pork intake has remained fairly steady. Studies show that cost, convenience and health concerns are among the top reasons Americans have cut back on beef.
Mixed messages
But the health messages about red meat have been confusing. Earlier this year, a group of scientists challenged decades of nutrition advice, saying that warnings linking red meat consumption to heart disease and cancer are not backed by strong scientific evidence, though it was later revealed that the study’s lead author had past research ties to an industry group whose members include fast-food companies and a beef processor.
Meat producers are taking the fight against fake meat to lawmakers. At least 25 states have introduced bills making it illegal to use the words “beef” or “meat” on products made from plant ingredients or cultured meat that is grown in a lab. Missouri became the first state to pass such a law last year, which was initially proposed by the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.
In October, Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., the top recipient of livestock industry donations in the House, introduced a federal bill that would require companies to put the word “imitation” on their plant-based meat products. The bill calls for the products to carry a statement on their packages “that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat.”
Marshall, an obstetrician, said he introduced the bill after hearing from constituents. Patients of his told him they were confused about the health benefits of plant-based beef substitutes, and beef producers told him they were frustrated that the products are sold in grocery stores next to ground beef. “Kansas has a very large beef industry, and they said, ‘Why are we allowing this fake meat in the meat department?’ ” he said.

Texto completo: The U.S. House of Representatives' Democratic-led Judiciary Committee on Tuesday released two proposed articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. If the committee and the House approves the articles, Trump would be the third president in American history to be charged with high crimes and misdemeanors through the formal impeachment process. The members of the North Dakota congressional delegation reacted to the major development in ways that close observers would describe as predictable, promoting the viewpoint of their party. The first article of impeachment charges Trump with abusing his power by soliciting Ukraine to investigate a political rival for personal gain. It also says Trump purposely withheld military aid from Ukraine to compel the eastern European country to abide by his request. The second article charges him with obstructing Congress by blocking members of his administration from testifying and defying subpoenas for documents during the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., said House Democrats are impeaching Trump "on charges they can't prove." The first-term congressman and member of the committee called the obstruction charge "baseless," saying the president had a right to object to subpoenas and the Democrats should wait for the courts to rule on the subject. "In an effort to satisfy their base, House Democrats are dividing the country," Armstrong said. "Today is a sad day for our nation." North Dakota's Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer chimed in to say that House Democrats have been determined to impeach Trump since he was elected in 2016. Both senators have maintained throughout the impeachment inquiry that there's more important work the House should be doing instead. "The evidence in their articles is underwhelming at best," Cramer said. "House Democrats ought to scrap this fantasy and get back to working for the American people." The committee will debate the articles later this week, and if they are approved, a House vote could come as early as next week, according to the New York Times. If the the articles clear the Democratic-held House, Trump's trial would begin shortly thereafter in the Republican-held Senate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump plans to sign an executive order to combat anti-Semitism on college campuses by threatening to cut off federal funds to schools that don't curb discrimination against Jewish students, according to a senior administration official.
The order, to be signed Wednesday, is designed to target the Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel movement, popular on college campuses. The Trump administration -- along with critics on the left and the right -- have long argued BDS is a pernicious form of anti-Semitism akin to discrimination against racial minorities or women.
The order, earlier reported by the New York Times, would define discrimination against Jewish students as a form of bias against their shared national identity -- Israel -- rather than just a form of religious discrimination. Defining Judaism effectively as a form of national identity allows the Education Department to open civil-rights investigations into schools that it deems not to be fostering an open climate for Jewish students. Under federal civil rights law, the Education Department doesn't have authority to crack down on direct forms of religious bias.
Critics of a tougher federal approach against BDS say the government is infringing on the free-speech rights of the movement's supporters and essentially favoring Jewish students over Muslim students.
"It is designed to chill any kind of speech that is critical of Israel," said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. "This would be unconstitutional."
At least 27 states have passed laws attempting to curb the BDS movement, in part by requiring state contractors to sign pledges not to support it. Several of those laws have been struck down in federal courts as a violation of the First Amendment.
The president's executive order is intended to achieve through administrative action what a long-stalled bill in Congress, the Anti-Semitism Awareness act, would have written into law.
The executive order also adopts a definition of anti-Semitism from the State Department, which defines one form of it as "denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination" and cites opposition to Israel as an example of that behavior. Free-speech advocates fear that definition could allow the administration to go after any criticism of Israel as a form of discrimination, with millions of dollars in federal funding at stake.
Expanding the Education Department's purview to oversee the BDS movement on college campuses has been the goal of the top civil-rights official at the department, Ken Marcus, who was formerly president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center. In that role, Mr. Marcus filed civil-rights complaints with the Education Department against universities with prominent Palestinian-solidarity organizations, which promoted activities the complaints said amounted to "harassment" of Jewish students.

Theater Landlord Evicts 'Beetlejuice'

Texto completo: The $ 21 million musical will be hoping for a new home after the Shubert Organization made way for Hugh Jackman and 'The Music Man.'
"Beetlejuice," which overcame a sluggish start to become a fan favorite on Broadway, is being evicted from its theater to make room for another musical that promises to be more lucrative.
The Shubert Organization, which is the largest landlord on Broadway, has ordered "Beetlejuice" to vacate the Winter Garden Theater, where its last performance will be on June 6. The musical is being edged out to make way for next fall's revival of "The Music Man," a heavily promoted project from the powerful producer Scott Rudin that stars one of Broadway's most reliable audience draws: Hugh Jackman.
The ouster of a show that is doing well -- "Beetlejuice" grossed nearly $ 1.6 million over Thanksgiving week, setting a record for the Winter Garden -- is unusual, reflecting the high demand for limited theater space at a time when Broadway is booming.
"It's sad and a shame, and also, in its own way, historic," said Hal Luftig, a "Beetlejuice" co-producer who has been working on Broadway for 30 years. "I don't think there's ever been a case when a show has turned itself around in such a fashion and then has to leave its theater."
It is not clear what will happen next. The producers of "Beetlejuice," led by the theatrical arm of Warner Bros., are hoping to find another New York theater, but the show's elaborate set would make such a move expensive. They are also planning a North American tour starting in 2021, and exploring productions in Britain and Australia.
The development is a blow to the show's investors, who had until now been heartened by the musical's unexpected (but very on brand) return from death's door. The show was capitalized for $ 21 million, and it would be nearly impossible to recoup those costs by June.
"It's disappointing," said Mark Kaufman, the executive vice president of Warner Bros. Theater Ventures. "We took the time and we built a hit, and now we're going to have our life at this theater cut short."
The stage musical, written by Scott Brown, Anthony King and Eddie Perfect and directed by Alex Timbers, is adapted from the 1988 Warner Bros. release, directed by Tim Burton, about a Goth girl and a pushy poltergeist warring within a haunted house.
In setting a deadline for the musical to leave the theater, the Shubert Organization is invoking a "stop clause" that allows it to oust a show whose grosses fall below an agreed upon level for two weeks in a row.
Invoking such a clause is not unprecedented, but what makes this situation unusual is that although "Beetlejuice" fell below the specified level last May, since then its grosses have rebounded.
The Shubert Organization notified "Beetlejuice" in June -- after the Tony Awards -- that it had hit the stop clause.
By the time the show rebounded, however, the Winter Garden was already committed to its next tenant: The theater owners had reached an agreement with Rudin that would allow him, more than a year later, to run "The Music Man" there.
The Shuberts sent "Beetlejuice" a formal letter on Oct. 1 informing them that they needed to vacate next spring; "Beetlejuice" is now making its plight public as it puts a final block of tickets on sale.
The announcement will also clear the way for "The Music Man" to announce its plans, which it expects to do next month; until now, the production has taken the unusual step of selling tickets for seats at an unnamed theater, and even on Monday it declined to comment or confirm its venue.
Warner Bros. unsuccessfully broached the idea of a compromise that could satisfy both shows. Among other proposals, the company offered to pay to relocate "To Kill a Mockingbird," a box office hit also produced by Rudin, from the Shubert Theater to a smaller house, so "The Music Man" could be staged at the Shubert while "Beetlejuice" remained at the Winter Garden.
But the two production teams could not agree on a price tag.
"It's no secret that the producer of 'Music Man' wanted that theater," Luftig said. "If I had one wish, I wish they could have all sat down to think of a Plan B, because we're in a precarious situation now."
The Shubert Organization declined to comment for this article, other than to say: "If an appropriate theater becomes available, we would certainly talk about moving the show."
"Beetlejuice" has already overcome several obstacles. The show's 2018 pre-Broadway tryout in Washington was panned by the Washington Post critic Peter Marks. It was revised before opening on Broadway in April, but was greeted in New York with mixed reviews (in The New York Times, an unimpressed Ben Brantley called it "absolutely exhausting"); it was then nominated for eight Tony Awards but won none.
The show brought in $ 818,904 in its first full week after opening, which was below its stop clause. But, after a boffo and much-viewed performance on the Tony Awards broadcast, it began to rebound midsummer, and has grossed over $ 1 million most weeks since mid-July.

The show's advance -- the value of tickets sold for future performances -- has doubled over the last six months, to $ 7.6 million, during a period when most see their advances drop. Just last week, the show sold 16,586 advance tickets worth $ 1.7 million, according to Matt Polk, a spokesman for the production.
In fact, every financial indicator has been pointing up: The advance has risen in 16 of the last 17 weeks; the average ticket price has grown; and group sales are way up, Polk said.
The reversal of fortune has been fueled by strong word of mouth, particularly among first-time theatergoers, and a shift in marketing strategy, which pivoted from emphasizing the show's irreverence to celebrating its sense of fun.
The "Beetlejuice" cast recording has been streamed 100 million times, and the performers have worked hard to promote the musical, whose opening number, "The Whole 'Being Dead' Thing," has been given lyrics tailored for television appearances, most recently on "The View" and at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
The production has also courted ardent enthusiasts (and repeat attenders) dubbed "Netherlings." There have been costume contests, and fan art is displayed backstage. And the show is among the first on Broadway to thrive on TikTok, a popular mobile app used to make and share short videos.
"I sit in all these Broadway League meetings where they talk about building a new audience for Broadway," said an obviously frustrated Kaufman. "Once we started building that audience, it started to take off -- we are the textbook definition of word of mouth."
Kaufman said that, over the next seven months, he would try to sustain the show's momentum in hopes of keeping it alive. "We'd be foolish to give up," he said. "You don't work this hard to not power on."

Lori Loughlin spends holidays prepping for next big role: Testifying at her own trial

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Texto completo: There was a moment in which people thought — and many liberals feared — that Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and former United States ambassador to the United Nations, would be the post-Donald Trump face of the Republican Party as a political candidate.
She was somewhat respected, had crafted an image of competence and seemed to have more of a moral center than many Republicans now toeing the line in support of Trump. Also, she would solve, or at least challenge, two of the issues that continue to dog Republicans: racism and misogyny. She is an Indian American woman.
But, Haley burned all that to the ground when she engaged in an astounding bit of revisionist racial history about the Confederate battle flag and its relationship to Dylann Roof, the then 21-year-old white supremacist who in 2015 gunned down nine black worshippers in the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
In an interview for Glenn Beck’s podcast, Haley said:
“Here is this guy that comes out with his manifesto, holding the Confederate flag and had just hijacked everything that people thought of. We don’t have hateful people in South Carolina. There’s always the small minority that’s always going to be there, but people saw it as service and sacrifice and heritage. But once he did that, there was no way to overcome it.”
This is such an astonishing statement for the very brazenness of its erasure of history and its bowing to a racist narrative. Any image of morality and unity Haley had cultivated vanished when those words left her lips.
Even the idea that Haley is a heroine of the taking down of the flag in South Carolina is a myth, like the idea that Roof suddenly altered the reality and meaning of the flag.
So, I reached out to Bree Newsome Bass, the young activist who scaled a flagpole in the wake of the shooting and removed the Confederate battle flag by hand. Bass is a true heroine of the flag’s removal.
Bass quite correctly saw Haley’s response “as part of the ongoing revisionist history that people continue to engage in around Confederate symbology.”
The NAACP had been boycotting the state for 15 years, including under Haley’s tenure as governor, before the state finally took it down. In 2011, Ben Jealous, then the NAACP president, issued this scathing assessment of Haley on the flag: “Perhaps one of the most perplexing examples of the contradictions of this moment in history is that Nikki Haley, South Carolina’s first governor of color, continues to fly the Confederate flag in front of her state’s Capitol.”
Indeed, just eight months before Dylann Roof executed his horrific act of white-supremacist terror, she deflected from the issue of removing the flag in a gubernatorial debate, instead saying of the “sensitive issue” surrounding it, “We really kind of fixed all that when we elected the first Indian American female governor.”
Be clear, Haley: The Indian American journey in this country is special and important, but that journey has absolutely nothing to do with adjusting or erasing the journey of enslaved Africans and their descendants in this country.
Haley used her status as a racial minority to shield her party’s racial animus.
The people who want to recast this racist emblem of a flag as “Southern pride” are the white Republicans in the South that Haley had to court to win her seat. A CNN poll conducted in 2015 found that 75% of Southern whites describe the flag as a symbol of pride.
Let’s be clear: The Confederate battle flag we know today is an emblem of oppression, white supremacy and the fight to maintain slavery. That is its heritage.
William T. Thompson wrote in an 1863 editorial about the “Stainless Banner,” the second national flag of the Confederacy, “Our idea is simply to combine the present battle flag with a pure white standard sheet.” He continued, “As a people, we are fighting to maintain the heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematic of our cause.”
In South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag made a slow march to greater prominence as civil rights for black people were asserted or attained, beginning by being displayed in the State House in 1938 “after angry Southerners in Congress managed to defeat a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime” and reaching the top of the dome on the Capitol in 1962 “after President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting and the Supreme Court struck down segregation in public transportation,” as The New York Times wrote in 2015.
Whereas Roof’s killings had shocked the state, and President Barack Obama’s eulogy at the funeral of one of the slain had moved it, Bass’ radical action had embarrassed it.
As she put it, when Dylann Roof displayed the Confederate flag, “He was coming in the tradition of that racism and that violence.”
Bass makes a piercing point: The NAACP and the Ku Klux Klan “are in agreement about what the Confederate flag is.” There is no true ambiguity.

Texto completo: Will James Comey demand another apology?
The former Federal Bureau of Investigation director has always been at his most natural when most aggrieved. Within hours of the release of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report Monday, Mr. Comey had an op-ed up at the Washington Post.
In a tweet touting his piece, Mr. Comey put it this way: "So it was all lies. No treason. No spying on the campaign. No tapping Trumps wires. It was just good people trying to protect America."
This comes as no surprise to anyone who remembers when an earlier inspector general report called him "insubordinate" for having "intentionally concealed" from his Justice Department bosses his plans for a press conference exonerating Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing over her use of a private email server to send classified material.
Mr. Comey's answer that time? An op-ed in the New York Times under the headline, "This Report Says I Was Wrong. But That's Good for the F.B.I."
Then, in August 2019, Mr. Horowitz's office released still another report, this one dealing with Mr. Comey's leaking of memos detailing confidential conversations he'd had with President Trump. In addition to highlighting Mr. Comey's dishonesty toward the FBI agents dispatched to his home to retrieve the memos, the inspector general scored Mr. Comey for setting "a dangerous example" for the bureau. Later Mr. Horowitz testified that he'd recommended Mr. Comey be prosecuted.
How did Mr. Comey respond? By ignoring the larger indictment of his FBI leadership and focusing only on Mr. Horowitz's finding that they'd unearthed no evidence Mr. Comey had leaked classified information. "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," Mr. Comey tweeted.
So another Comey tweet demanding yet another apology is entirely likely. And it points to the low bar Mr. Comey has now set for America's most prestigious law enforcement agency: Unless the conduct is criminal, anything goes.
In practice this means overlooking a great deal of ugly behavior. The following, culled from Mr. Horowitz's new report, is long but by no means exhaustive:
-- Even though Christopher Steele's dossier was full of material Mr. Comey himself characterized as "salacious and unverified," it played a "central and essential role" in the bureau's decision to seek a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
-- The FBI failed to inform Justice of "significant information that was available" but "was inconsistent with, or undercut," claims in the FISA applications that Mr. Page was "an agent of a foreign power."
-- The FBI ignored various warnings about Mr. Steele's political bias, and it took him at his word when he falsely told agents he wasn't the source for a Yahoo News article the FBI would cite in its application to the court.
-- Overall, the report identifies "at least 17 significant errors or omissions in the Carter Page FISA applications" -- for which investigators received no "satisfactory answers."
-- The FBI also didn't inform the FISA court that Mr. Page had served as a Central Intelligence Agency source and received a "positive assessment" for candor from the agency.
-- Mr. Comey pushed to include Mr. Steele's dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment even though the CIA "expressed concern about the lack of vetting."
-- An FBI lawyer altered an email he'd received confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source. After he changed it to read "not a source," the email was then used to help renew the FISA warrant on Mr. Page.
Mr. Horowitz lays the blame at the top: "We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams; on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations; after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI; even though the information sought through use of FISA authority related so closely to an ongoing presidential campaign; and even though those involved with the investigation knew that their actions were likely to be subjected to close scrutiny. We believe this circumstance reflects a failure not just by those who prepared the FISA applications, but also by the managers and supervisors in the [investigation's] chain of command, including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed."
Mr. Comey's memoir, "A Higher Loyalty," relates how as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo from J. Edgar Hoover asking for permission to wiretap Martin Luther King. He claims he did so to help ensure the bureau would never forget how a "legitimate counterintelligence mission . . . morphed into an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack."
Mr. Horowitz's findings about what was done under Mr. Comey's leadership suggest there's still a need for such a reminder. But maybe it should be a copy of the FISA applications for Carter Page the FBI sent to the court with false, misleading and incomplete information -- and Mr. Comey's signature.

Texto completo: Will James Comey demand another apology?
The former Federal Bureau of Investigation director has always been at his most natural when most aggrieved. Within hours of the release of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report Monday, Mr. Comey had an op-ed up at the the Washington Post.
In a tweet touting his piece, Mr. Comey put it this way: "So it was all lies. No treason. No spying on the campaign. No tapping Trumps wires. It was just good people trying to protect America."
This comes as no surprise to anyone who remembers when an earlier inspector general report called him "insubordinate" for having "intentionally concealed" from his Justice Department bosses his plans for a press conference exonerating Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing over her use of a private email server to send classified material.
Mr. Comey's answer that time? An op-ed in the New York Times under the headline, "This Report Says I Was Wrong. But That's Good for the F.B.I."
Then, in August 2019, Mr. Horowitz's office released still another report, this one dealing with Mr. Comey's leaking of memos detailing confidential conversations he'd had with President Trump. In addition to highlighting Mr. Comey's dishonesty toward the FBI agents dispatched to his home to retrieve the memos, the inspector general scored Mr. Comey for setting "a dangerous example" for the bureau. Later Mr. Horowitz testified that he'd recommended Mr. Comey be prosecuted.
How did Mr. Comey respond? By ignoring the larger indictment of his FBI leadership and focusing only on Mr. Horowitz's finding that they'd unearthed no evidence Mr. Comey had leaked classified information. "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," Mr. Comey tweeted.
So another Comey tweet demanding yet another apology is entirely likely. And it points to the low bar Mr. Comey has now set for America's most prestigious law enforcement agency: Unless the conduct is criminal, anything goes.
In practice this means overlooking a great deal of ugly behavior. The following, culled from Mr. Horowitz's new report, is long but by no means exhaustive:
• Even though Christopher Steele's dossier was full of material Mr. Comey himself characterized as "salacious and unverified," it played a "central and essential role" in the bureau's decision to seek a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
• The FBI failed to inform Justice of "significant information that was available" but "was inconsistent with, or undercut," claims in the FISA applications that Mr. Page was "an agent of a foreign power."
• The FBI ignored various warnings about Mr. Steele's political bias, and it took him at his word when he falsely told agents he wasn't the source for a Yahoo News article the FBI would cite in its application to the court.
• Overall, the report identifies "at least 17 significant errors or omissions in the Carter Page FISA applications"—for which investigators received no "satisfactory answers."
• The FBI also didn't inform the FISA court that Mr. Page had served as a Central Intelligence Agency source and received a "positive assessment" for candor from the agency.
• Mr. Comey pushed to include Mr. Steele's dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment even though the CIA "expressed concern about the lack of vetting."
• An FBI lawyer altered an email he'd received confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source. After he changed it to read "not a source," the email was then used to help renew the FISA warrant on Mr. Page.
Mr. Horowitz lays the blame at the top: "We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams; on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations; after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI; even though the information sought through use of FISA authority related so closely to an ongoing presidential campaign; and even though those involved with the investigation knew that their actions were likely to be subjected to close scrutiny. We believe this circumstance reflects a failure not just by those who prepared the FISA applications, but also by the managers and supervisors in the [investigation's] chain of command, including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed."
Mr. Comey's memoir, "A Higher Loyalty," relates how as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo from J. Edgar Hoover asking for permission to wiretap Martin Luther King. He claims he did so to help ensure the bureau would never forget how a "legitimate counterintelligence mission . . . morphed into an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack."
Mr. Horowitz's findings about what was done under Mr. Comey's leadership suggest there's still a need for such a reminder. But maybe it should be a copy of the FISA applications for Carter Page the FBI sent to the court with false, misleading and incomplete information—and Mr. Comey's signature.

Stop helping Vladimir Putin

Texto completo: Pretty much everyone acknowledges Russia’s malicious interference in the 2016 election. While we’re not convinced the interference swayed the election in any meaningful way, we should all be concerned about what happened and about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans for 2020. Our government, and even our media, will need to be on high alert to counter and deter future Russian interference in our elections.
But battling Putin’s disinformation is harder than it should be, and that's in part thanks to Democratic spin and media malpractice.
When Democrats pretend Putin’s only goal was and is to elect President Trump, or when they angrily deny that Ukraine’s leaders made any efforts on behalf of Hillary Clinton, they are weakening our ability to battle Putin.
Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is a rare sober voice in Washington on this topic. Speaking with the Washington Examiner editorial board on Monday, Hurd stressed that the House Intelligence Committee hasn’t put enough focus on preventing 2020 election interference because it has been consumed with political charades.
“What were the Russians trying to do? They were trying to erode trust in our democratic institutions," he said. "They wanted the American public to question the media, to question whether anyone in government is worth anything. And they’re going to do it again. We haven’t focused on disinformation.”
Here we need to address the campaign of disinformation, or at least misinformation, by Democrats and the national media regarding Ukrainian efforts in 2016. Former presidential adviser Fiona Hill participated in this campaign when she alleged, finger pointed at Republicans, that “some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country, and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”
The first part of this isn’t true. Not a single Republican on the Intelligence Committee denies that Russia conducted such a campaign. But the second part is a rhetorical trick — a game of pretend, that anyone who says Ukraine tried to influence the 2016 election is thereby denying Russia’s role or are equating Ukraine’s interference with Russia’s much more extensive and elaborate interference.
The New York Times echoed this same carefully parsed line, setting fire to an assertion that literally no one is making, “that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.”
Another example: When Clinton suggests her political rivals are Russian assets, this actually furthers Putin’s aims. “That kind of narrative feeds into what the Russians are trying to do,” Hurd said. “I guarantee you there was a [Russian officer] in Moscow that got a raise when Hillary Clinton said those things about Tulsi [Gabbard] and Bernie Sanders. It continues to perpetuate this lack of trust, and that is the ultimate goal of the Russian government.”
Although Putin must have preferred a Trump victory to the widely expected Clinton victory, he was surely even more thrilled by the Democrats' reaction, which was to begin working for impeachment even before Trump had taken the inaugural stage. "The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun" was the headline of a Washington Post story that published at 12:19 p.m. on Inauguration Day.
Putin is working hard to make Americans more cynical and skeptical about their government, their institutions, their political parties, and their leaders. When the media and politicians mislead the public about Russia's aims for political gain, they are only helping Putin achieve his ends.

Texto completo: The Saudi national who opened fire at a Navy base in Florida was outraged at his peers who slapped him with the nickname “Porn Stash.”
Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, opened fire, killing three and wounding seven, at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. Alshamrani was named as the presumed terrorist on Friday, but he was known by a different name on the base: "Porn Stash."
The accused terrorist sported a thick mustache similar to the facial hair of many adult film stars.
Alshamrani was “infuriated” after a meteorology instructor, James Day, called him “Porn Stash” during class in front of nearly a dozen other students. The Saudi national filed a complaint with his superior officer about the public mockery.
“I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,” Alshamrani said in the complaint obtained by the New York Times. “Laughing, he continued to ask, ‘What? Have you not seen a porn star before? After I did not respond, he just let go of the subject.”
The incident took place more than seven months ago, and the FBI does not believe the nickname was the basis for the shooting. Day’s employer noted that they had no updates related to the situation because it had been handled and closed in April. Day had offered to apologize to Alshamrani, but the gunman declined and requested to be reassigned to a different instructor, which he was.
Authorities have presumed that the shooting as an “act of terror” and Saudi officials have been retracing Alshamrani’s steps to see if he had been radicalized during a visit to the Middle East in February.
Photo Caption:This undated photo provided by the FBI shows Mohammed Alshamrani. The Saudi student opened fire inside a classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday before one of the deputies killed him.

Impeachment backlash: Poll has Trump trouncing all comers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan

Texto completo: You don't need a high opinion of President Trump to have a low opinion of the current partisan impeachment process. The reaction of Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd to the impeachment hearings so far serves as evidence of that. More on Hurd later — suffice it to say that he is retiring and outspokenly unhappy with Trump, and he's also not impressed with impeachment.
It seems a lot of voters feel the same way. Because Trump remains unpopular in every poll I've ever seen, but another set of polls is out showing him running really well — frighteningly well, in fact. The new Firehouse Strategies polls out today complement the recent New York Times polls showing Trump taking leads over most of the potential Democratic nominees in such key states as Florida, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
This time, Trump is leading Biden and all other Democratic comers in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin. This data point is consistent with the idea that Democrats took things too far with their visceral hatred for the president.
Firehouse is a Republican firm, and these Trump leads are unusually large — for example, nine points over Biden in Wisconsin? Yet this is confirmation of what the earlier set of nonpartisan polls seemed to hint at. If the 2016 election taught me anything, it is to distrust polls, but even more to distrust conventional ideas about what the polls should say ("why aren't I fifty points ahead?")
If people in swing states are getting sour over impeachment, then Democrats and liberals are completely oblivious to the danger they're in. They seem deluded into thinking that they've got Richard Nixon on their hands. But people widely viewed Nixon as corrupt, across party lines, because he really was corrupt. That's why a bipartisan consensus formed to impeach him.
In contrast Trump ... well, he's just Trump. You don't have to like it, but temporary impoundment of funds is a very weak argument for impeachment, and the abuse of power charge is certainly at least debatable. If people react negatively to this exercise, again, because it's completely partisan, then it shouldn't really come as that much of a surprise.

Let's be 'clear' about getting gas 18 local service stations now sell 'clear gas,' but the vast majority of cars don't need it

Texto completo: Getting There
In a brick shed behind his house on Bagley Avenue in Detroit, Henry Ford built his first car.
The 32-year-old Ford produced only one Quadricycle Runabout in 1896, and he built it by hand from four bicycle wheels, steel, wood, rubber, cloth and glass. He fabricated a two-cylinder engine using a design described in the Jan. 9, 1896, edition of American Machinist magazine.
It also ran on ethanol, not gasoline.
The observant motorist may notice that cars now run on gasoline. The savvy driver surely also notes that gasoline commonly contains ethanol.
Look at any gas pump. Unleaded, mid-grade, premium - they all have ethanol added in and have for some time. More and more gas stations, however, are starting to offer another choice: pure, unadulterated gasoline.
There are 11 gas stations in Spokane that sell clear gas, which is pure gasoline with no ethanol added, according to pure-gas.org. Another seven in Spokane Valley offer the fuel. Some of those 18 stations began selling clear gas as early as 2017, but seven of them put the option on the pump just this year.
Without going too much into the science behind it all, ethanol helps reduce tailpipe emissions when it's mixed with gasoline. Ethanol, an alcohol made from corn, brings more oxygen into the chemical equation, allowing the fuel to burn more completely and produce cleaner emissions.
The ethanol addition is required by the 1990 Clean Air Act and the renewable fuel standard described in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These federal laws give states discretion on how this requirement is met. In Washington, the renewable fuel standard requires that at least 2% of the total volume of gasoline sold in the state must be ethanol.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that nearly 143 billion barrels of gasoline were consumed in the U.S. in 2018. That equates to about 390 million gallons a day, on average. Those many, many gallons of gas contained about 14 billion gallons of ethanol - 10% of the total volume.
But while the gas-ethanol mixture may burn cleaner, ethanol has only about 70% the energy content of gasoline, so it powers fewer miles per gallon. In other words, ethanol begets cleaner air, but pure gasoline begets more miles. With pure gasoline, the more bang-for-your-buck requires more bucks, since pure gas is more expensive than ethanol blends.
So why choose clear gas?
Some motorists may want it in their old cars, and by old we mean pre-1990. Older engines can combust ethanol, but it hastens their wear and tear. Other motorists believe their vehicles need the purity that airplanes require.
But let's be frank. The vast majority of cars don't need pure gasoline. Considering that vehicle emissions are the largest contributor to greenhouse gases in Washington state, the region's many motorists should do as much as they can to lessen their share of air pollution.
Harmful tailpipe emissions go back a long way. In 1921, a General Motors engineer named Thomas Midgley Jr. found a new way to reduce the "knocking" in auto engines: the highly toxic additive called tetraethyl lead.
As James Lincoln Kitman wrote in The Nation in 2000, engine knocking was a sign of an inefficient motor. Such feckless engines by nature created more emissions and, more important for GM's bottom line, customers didn't want a loud, obnoxious car. The engineer Midgley tried everything "from melted butter and camphor to ethyl acetate and aluminum chloride." Ethanol, it turns out, worked great to solve the problem.
But GM didn't like ethanol. It couldn't be patented, and the corporate giant couldn't control its production. What's more, Kitman wrote, "the oil companies hated it, a powerful disincentive for the fledgling GM, which was loath to jeopardize relations with these mighty power brokers."
In February 1923, filling stations began selling so-called leaded gasoline. Midgley wasn't there. He was "in bed with severe lead poisoning," according to a Smithsonian article on leaded gas.
The poisoning was no surprise to Midgley. Lead's toxicity had been known since 1854. It also shouldn't have been a shock that men working in GM's tetraethyl lead factory "showed stunning signs of mental deterioration, from memory loss to a stumbling loss of coordination to sudden twitchy bursts of rage," according to a 2013 article in Wired magazine. By October 1924, 32 of the 49 factory workers were hospitalized. Five died.
Decades passed and engines burned lead with dire consequences. In 1986, the federal government outlawed the use of lead as a gas additive, and the mean blood lead level in the American population dropped more than 75% in 15 years. But the damage had already been done.
A study done in 1985 by the Environmental Protection Agency found that as many as 5,000 people in the U.S. died every year from lead-related heart disease prior to the federal prohibition on leaded gas. A 1988 congressional report done by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry showed that 2 million children had blood lead levels reduced every year, to below toxic levels, between 1970 and 1987 as the use of leaded gasoline was phased out.
Kitman, in The Nation, said that "one can conservatively estimate that a total of about 68 million young children had toxic exposures to lead from gasoline from 1927 to 1987."
Considering all the toxicity and air pollution, it's tempting to think about how different things could've been.
Ford didn't use leaded gasoline in his glorified bicycle and home-built engine. Though he ended up making all his vehicles run on petroleum-based fuel, he almost didn't use gasoline. In 1925, Ford praised vegetable-derived fuels like ethanol.
"The fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road, or from apples, weeds, sawdust - almost anything," Ford told the New York Times. "There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented. There's enough alcohol in one year's yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years."
Spokane bike summit
The annual bike summit by Cascade Bicycle Club and Washington Bikes is being held in Spokane next year, and the organizers are seeking proposals for presentations and workshops.
The 2020 summit, which also focuses on walking, active transportation and disability rights, will be held on April 26 and 27 at the Spokane Convention Center. The theme is "Shift: From Ideas to Action."
The summit's planners want "innovative, thought provoking, action-oriented content related to biking, walking, active transportation, disability rights and transportation justice from Washington state and beyond."
For more information about the summit, visit cascade.org. Questions about presentation and workshop proposals should be directed to Tamar Shuhendler at tamars@cascade.org. The deadline to submit proposals is Sunday.

Texto completo: At a NATO summit in London, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his adversaries back across the pond: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a key figure in the inquiry into impeaching the president.
Trump has repeatedly referred back to the time when Schiff paraphrased Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — an event at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.
Trump has portrayed Schiff’s words as a fabrication that twisted what he said and in a press conference at the NATO summit, Trump once again attacked Schiff over his remarks, suggesting that Schiff could be arrested for what he said.
“This guy (Schiff) is sick,” Trump said. “He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn’t do that in the halls of Congress, he’d be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he’s given immunity. This is a sick person. He’s a liar.”
We found it hard to believe that, outside of the walls of Congress, someone who fabricated and lied would be “thrown in jail.” Experts said there is something to what Trump is saying that deserves explanation, but ultimately he’s still wrong that Schiff could be subject to prosecution, even if he wasn’t in Congress. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)
The Speech or Debate Clause
Trump has a point that members of Congress have special speech protections that members of the general public do not.
The Constitution’s “Speech or Debate Clause” says that “for any Speech or Debate in either House, (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other Place.”
“The Speech or Debate Clause protects legislators from all criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits for legislative conduct, broadly understood as anything within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity and necessary to the deliberative process,” said Howard M. Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University. “This includes the sort of legislative oversight and investigation in which Schiff is engaged when discussing that phone call.”
Can fabrication or libel be punished criminally?
The vast majority of libel or slander cases are civil rather than criminal, said Leonard Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. This means the speaker’s money could be at risk if they lose a libel or slander case, but they would not be imprisoned.
However, criminal libel laws of one kind or another do exist on the books in almost half the states. According to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists, two dozen states have criminal libel laws.
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1964 case Garrison vs. Louisiana that the standard for criminal conviction is the same as in the landmark case from the same year, New York Times vs. Sullivan, that addresses civil libel cases. “The prosecution must prove falsity and actual malice, beyond a reasonable doubt,” Wasserman said.
Some of today’s 24 state laws wouldn’t be relevant to the Schiff example. The laws in Illinois and Texas only cover slanders against financial institutions, while the one in Massachusetts concerns hate speech based on race or other classifications. Three others specifically exclude imprisonment as a possible sentence.
In addition, the Committee to Protect Journalists cites court cases in seven of these states that would seem to make these laws unconstitutional today, meaning that their existence on the books is archaic.
In addition, such laws “would likely be deemed unconstitutional under the First Amendment if they were applied,” said Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
Importantly for Schiff’s case, there’s no criminal libel statute for the District of Columbia, or an equivalent federal statute. Nor is there one in Schiff’s home state of California.
“So even if Schiff’s summaries of the conversations were knowingly false and he were not immune, I am not sure what law he could be prosecuted under,” Wasserman said.
Our ruling
Trump said Schiff “made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn’t do that in the halls of Congress, he’d be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he’s given immunity.”
We rate the statement False.

China's Claim That Detainees in Xinjiang Have 'Graduated' Draws Skepticism; Rights activists are dubious about the assertion made by a top regional official, delivered in a rare Beijing news conference

Texto completo: BEIJING—A top official in China's heavily policed majority-Muslim northwest region of Xinjiang said those detained in a controversial deradicalization program have graduated, drawing broad skepticism from human-rights activists.
The rare news conference in the nation's capital on Monday by senior officials of Xinjiang was a response to growing international pressure on the Chinese government to defend its policies in the region. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to sanction officials involved in the crackdown, spurred in part by the publication of purported leaked government documents.
Scholars estimate that more than one million Turkic Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities have been detained in extrajudicial re-education centers in Xinjiang over the past few years, where deaths and torture have been reported. The government says the program is necessary to counter violent extremism, while Western government officials largely condemn it as a human-rights abuse.
Shohrat Zakir, who as governor of Xinjiang is the region's No. 2 official behind Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, said all students in the centers studying Mandarin, law, vocational skills and deradicalization have graduated. The suggestion that the re-education-camp system had been shut down was disputed by scholars and activists, who cautioned that the government has many other mechanisms for extrajudicial detention, and that it is unlikely to mean all Xinjiang's detainees have been released.
Maya Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, called Mr. Zakir's announcement ambiguous because it included no details on the number of centers and how many people had been in them, and to where they were released.
"Without any of that information, it's really difficult to evaluate the claim that they have all been released," she said. "The government had repeatedly denied that these camps existed, so what it says now is not very credible."
Mr. Zakir said a voluntary skills-training program would be launched for officials, villagers and unemployed residents across Xinjiang, which he said would offer independent choices of fields of study and allow people to come and go freely.
Adrian Zenz, a German researcher who has been critical of China's governance in Xinjiang, said that although the official line that all detainees had graduated was questionable, it showed that officials are feeling the heat. "What we've known all along is they do care about their reputation," he said, referring to the central government.
Beijing has reacted furiously since the House passed its bill last week calling for sanctions against Xinjiang officials. In its highest-level response, China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday that the U.S. had seriously violated international relations and demanded that it correct its mistakes.
Compounding the pressure are two caches of leaked Chinese-government documents that purport to outline details of the detention program, which were published separately last month by the New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists . Mr. Pompeo described the documents as confirmation of "very significant" human-rights abuses by the Chinese government.
Asked at the news conference about the documents, Xu Hairong, the party chief of Xinjiang's capital city of Urumqi, declined to confirm the authenticity of the papers, instead deriding the accompanying news reports as being malicious in nature.
Discussion among multinationals about whether to continue doing business in Xinjiang has been growing , and some have dropped suppliers in the region in the past year.
"The companies, like my own, we are very concerned," said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and the chief representative in China of German chemical giant BASF SE. BASF has a chemical plant that it set up with a local partner in Korla, a city in Xinjiang.
European companies should better monitor suppliers and customers, he said at an event on Monday in Beijing.
In recent days, the Chinese government has sought to remind the public of violent terrorist attacks over the years in Xinjiang, arguing that the harsh crackdown was necessary to fight terrorism. This push has included the release of graphic footage of car bombings and knife attacks, which are otherwise rarely shown publicly in China.

Free show lifting spirits of veterans Opera Orlando offering special performance

Texto completo: Free tickets for veterans to Opera Orlando's production of the Christmas musical "All Is Calm" sounded like a good idea to Gabriel Preisser.
"We wanted to do something for veterans," said Preisser, the opera's executive and artistic director - and, after all, "All Is Calm" is about real soldiers' experiences. "We thought it would be nice if 200 people came."
Instead, 1,700 veterans responded to the invitation - prompting Opera Orlando to add a special vet-only performance and make plans to squeeze the special guests into rehearsals leading up to the show's debut at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
"I just didn't want to turn all those people away," Preisser said.
Written by Peter Rothstein, "All Is Calm" tells the story of the Christmas Truce of 1914. During World War I, Allied and German soldiers put down their weapons and climbed out of their battle trenches on Christmas Eve to briefly celebrate the holiday.
"The heroes of this story are the lowest of the ranks - the young, the hungry, the cold, and the optimistic - those who acted with great courage to put down their guns, overcoming a fear that placed a gun in their hands in the first place," Rothstein writes on the show's official website. "Their story puts a human face on war, and that's the story I hope to tell."
Letters home from actual soldiers provide the show's dialogue. And a cappella singing provides a haunting soundtrack to the effects of war. Critics raved after the show made its off-Broadway debut in 2018. The New York Times named it a Critic's Pick, and described it as "a beautiful musical recounting of a World War I cease-fire of gifts, poetry and melody."
Preisser has a theory on why the show has struck a chord.
"There's something really special about a male a cappella singing" - singing without any instrumental accompaniment, he said. "And obviously, there's something very special about the Christmas truce itself."
Although the play's soldiers are from a hundred years ago, today's veterans should find them relatable.
"The show was just eye-opening to me, thinking about how those young men got in that situation," Preisser said. "Think about being a 19-year-old boy, putting on a uniform, experiencing the pageantry and thinking you'd come home in three weeks as a hero. It was all glory and honor - it was all romanticized."
In reality, the bloody war would drag on for four years. The overwhelming response also surprised Andrea N. Madrazo, a public-affairs specialist for the Orlando VA Medical Center. Preisser had enlisted her help to reach veterans.
"I didn't think it would be that high," Madrazo said. "They've been coming in to get their tickets. We are very appreciative."
Those with experience in the armed forces often enjoy entertainment with a military theme, Madrazo said: "It really draws veterans in."
"Opera Orlando has lifted my spirits and gets me more in the mood for the holidays - and shows they care," said Robert Hughes, an Air Force veteran. "Thank you for spreading cheer and joy for us."
Opera Orlando has a history of offering free tickets during the holiday season. Its touring production of "Amahl and the Night Visitors" - a short opera about the journey of the Three Kings to see baby Jesus - gives free tickets to children at many locations. The city of Clermont sponsored a completely free performance of the show at its performing-arts center this month.
Adding the extra performance of "All Is Calm" for veterans will cost Opera Orlando about $7,000, Preisser said, but he's not focused on the expense.
"During the holiday season, given that we're a nonprofit and we're part of this community, we wanted to find a way to give back," he said. "We're going to lose a little money on this, but it's worth it."

BIDEN'S ACE IN THE HOLE VOTERS HAVE A THIRST FOR NOSTALGIA

Texto completo: I like the word malarkey, consarn it. It's the bee's knees. Sure, the youngsters might say, "OK, Boomer" on hearing Joe Biden utter the word, but if you think he's all wet for using it, you can take your phonus bolonus and tell it to Sweeney.
Mr. Biden has never really been my cup of tea. There's always seemed to be a bit of flimflam behind that gigglemug of his. And for a guy who uses the word malarkey more than any politician since the 19th century - and has now emblazoned the slogan "No Malarkey" on his campaign bus - he's peddled a lot of it over the years. But he remains popular among a lot of Democrats for the same reason people like the word malarkey: nostalgia, which can be a powerful force in an election.
While I'm prone to nostalgia myself, I'm fairly immune to Biden nostalgia. So are the hep cats of Twitter and Instagram, who have an outsize role in the Democratic primary process. Most of the Twitterati weren't even twinkles in their father's eye when Mr. Biden first ran for the Senate, and it's no surprise they don't get his appeal.
But if Donald Trump taught us anything, it should be that the opinions of smarty pants don't amount to a hill of beans compared with the opinions of voters. Mr. Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign was soaked with balderdash. He promised to balance the budget, cut taxes, spend wildly and save money in the process. He promised to fix the economy by putting China in its place and bringing back manufacturing. For nostalgic Republican voters, though, Mr. Trump's vision evoked just the sort of mythical past they aspired to inhabit one day. And it was a plus that Mr. Trump caused the self-righteous press to huff and puff their outrage as they declared him incapable of victory.
Mr. Biden benefits from a similar dynamic. The handicappers keep fitting him for a pine overcoat, but the voters haven't gotten the memo.
As Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru writes, "The only thing Joe Biden has had going for him in this race is Democratic primary voters." Mr. Biden has flubbed debates and failed to convince wealthy members of his party to open their wallets. But despite a barrage of negative press, he remains popular with a lot of voters, particularly older ones.
Nostalgia is Mr. Biden's trump card. For some voters, it's not nostalgia for the good old days of the 1950s or the 1920s but for the Obama years - which is why Mr. Biden mentions Barack Obama like a verbal punctuation mark. But the former vice president also appeals to a deeper nostalgia.
For moderate voters who think things have gone haywire under Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden represents a kind of return to normalcy, to a time when partisan politics weren't quite as lethal. He may be as prone to malapropisms and misstatements as Mr. Trump, but his folksy fumbling is a known quantity, a relic from a more predictable time.
Mr. Biden is also reassuring to Democratic voters who still think they're good liberals in the tradition of FDR, LBJ and Bill Clinton, and who honestly think their party is veering off the rails. They're the voters who aren't interested in who's tweeting what or what's trending in search engines, and there are a lot of them. A recent pre-obituary of the Kamala Harris campaign in The New York Times noted that many of the younger members of her team thought Twitter was the best place to figure out what voters really care about.
This doesn't mean everything is copacetic for Mr. Biden. But he's doing better than the wiseacres seem to think. He's up 11 points over the field nationally, nine in Nevada and 19 in South Carolina. In New Hampshire and Iowa, he's slipped considerably and is now running in fourth place. But it's still easy to imagine he could win in those states or pull off a close second. Bill Clinton came in second in New Hampshire in 1992 and, thanks to his gift for tooting his own horn, was dubbed "The Comeback Kid."
If Hoosier moppet Pete Buttigieg wins in Iowa and Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins in New Hampshire as a "favorite daughter" from neighboring Massachusetts, that wouldn't be ideal for Mr. Biden. But if he were to come in second in both places, which doesn't seem unlikely, he could still be rolling in clover, and that's no malarkey.

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: In last Sunday’s column, I argued that Democrats looking for someone to unify their fractious coalition should take another glance at Bernie Sanders — on the grounds that he’s more popular across the party’s different factions, more unifying, more exciting and more potentially appealing to non-liberals than his critics tend to assume.
There was one point I gestured at but didn’t stress, which is that in nominating Bernie, the Democrats would be embracing one of the key forces in American politics right now — the distrust of technocracy, the sense that the smartest guys in each political coalition can’t really be trusted, the feeling that the whole model of credentialed meritocracy is corrupt and self-dealing and doesn’t deliver on its promises.
In the Democratic coalition more than the Republican one, meritocracy and technocracy have long been unifying forces. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama represented somewhat different party factions, but they both embodied wonkery , a vision of competence and expertise governing to some extent above ideology, in which there are assumed to be “correct answers” to policy dilemmas that a disinterested observer could acknowledge and the right technocrat achieve.
The candidates carrying on this tradition in the Democratic primary are Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and the late-entering Michael Bloomberg — Buttigieg and Bloomberg as center-left figures, Warren as the progressive promising to direct her “I’ve got a plan for that!” wonkery to more ambitious ends.
But Sanders is different; he has policy plans, too, but he’s fundamentally a moralist arguing for a politics of righteous struggle, in a way that separates him from Warren as well as from Buttigieg or Bloomberg. And just as Donald Trump benefited in 2016 — and figures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush suffered — from a sense that the GOP’s libertarian and neoconservative intelligentsia bore some responsibility for the double disasters of Iraq and the financial crisis, Sanders benefits from a widespread left-wing disappointment with what the Obama-era politics of expertise produced.
This disappointment has been strongest on health care, where Obamacare’s most popular provision was the simple socialism of the Medicaid expansion rather than the complicated, expert-fashioned architecture of the exchanges. But it’s also palpable in education policy, where after two decades worth of technocratic experiments — Race to the Top, Common Core, etc. — we have chronically disappointing test scores, persistent racial gaps, the same basic stagnation despite reformers’ best-laid plans.
On both issues and others, the appeal of Sanders has less to do with the details of his plans and more to do with a simple formulation: The experts had their chance; let the moralists and radicals have theirs.
However, that’s only one possible response to disillusionment with technocracy. The other response is to prefer a return to transactional politics, to dealmakers who keep the system running rather than optimizing for efficiency, to machine politicians who aren’t going to dramatically improve the status quo but also aren’t likely to embrace clever plans that accidentally make it worse.
This is clearly the appeal of the other non-technocrat in the Democratic field, the still-front-running Joe Biden. Of course the former vice president also has plans and policy papers — no Democrat lacks them — but even more than Sanders he’s running as a non-wonk, an anti-technocrat, the guy who’ll shout “malarkey!” when the clever McKinsey guy shows up with the white paper and says you need to overhaul a popular program because there’s a more efficient way.
Despite his constant invocations of Obama, Biden no less than Sanders (and much more than Buttigieg and Warren) is running against the Obama governmental style, and especially the first-term Obamanaut confidence in intelligence and expertise as the essential oil of governance. If Sanders woos voters by saying, why not elect a moralist instead of an expert , Biden woos them by saying, how about we just elect a [expletive] politician?
In this contrast Sanders comes out ahead with the many Democratic voters who don’t think old-fashioned dealmaking is really possible anymore, and also with the important swath of disaffected voters who don’t like politicians or the Democratic Party, but do want to experiment with radicalism in Washington, D.C.
But Biden’s status quo-oriented version of the anti-technocratic pitch is better suited to the economic moment. America has systemic problems, certainly, but institutional sclerosis and futility are much more tolerable when the GDP is running hot and unemployment is at a generational low. As long as that environment persists, there is an obvious constituency, in Biden’s party and in the country, for pushing out Trump but otherwise eschewing grand ambitions, and just letting the expansion run as long as it can go.
So if the exhaustion with technocracy makes a socialist a viable nominee, that exhaustion plus a solid economy explains why the socialist may yet fall to an even more archaic breed — a party politician.

Remembering the stories, lessons of the late Larry Brown

Texto completo: Fans of the late Oxford author Larry Brown need wait no longer to own a collection of his career short works in one volume, with the release of Algonquin's "Tiny Love: The Complete Stories of Larry Brown."
It was fitting that writer Jonathan Miles, (author of the novels "Anatomy of a Miracle," "Want Not" and "Dear America Airlines," and who considered Brown to be both close friend and mentor since they met in Oxford in the early '90s) would be the one to contribute the foreword to the book.
"Larry published six novels, a memoir, a book of essays, and all the stories (in this new book), carving his name, indelibly, onto the thick tree trunk of American literature," Miles states in the foreword. "He strained and he faltered, yes, but he never lost his faith."
Without any training in writing or previous publication of a single piece, Brown literally taught himself to write – and he persevered through seven years of rejections until the publication of his first collection of short stories, "Facing the Music," in 1988. After his first novel, "Dirty Work," was published, he would quit his job as a firefighter in Oxford to devote his efforts fulltime to writing.
Among other recognitions, Brown would go on to win the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction, the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, and the Southern Book Award for Fiction – twice.
He died of an apparent heart attack at his home near Oxford in 2004.
Miles, a former columnist for the New York Times, served as a contributing editor to several national magazines, and his journalistic work appeared in the annual Best American Sports Writing and Best American Crime writing anthologies. A former longtime resident of Oxford, he now lives in rural New Jersey.
Miles shares his thoughts and memories about his friendship with Brown below.
How did the idea come about to publish all of Larry Brown's work in one volume, and how were you chosen to write the foreword to this book?
The idea had been bouncing around, among Larry's family and friends, for the last decade or more. The links between his two story collections – "Facing the Music" in 1988 and "Big Bad Love" in 1990 – are so strong that combining them felt like a natural and graceful merger. The greater desire, however, was to finally corral all the stray stories that Larry published in magazines and anthologies, so as to gather the entirety of his short fiction into one definitive volume. Those includes his wild masterpiece, "A Roadside Resurrection," which appeared in the Paris Review, as well as "Tiny Love," the prickly, lovelorn title story, which Larry published in a charity anthology, as well as the early stories he published in biker and horror magazines. I'd been shepherding the idea along, over the years, and was honored when Algonquin, Larry's longtime publisher, asked me to write the foreword.
Tell me about your friendship with Brown. How did you meet him, and what did you learn from him as a writer?
I met Larry in 1992, a very memorable meeting that I wrote about in the foreword. It involves dancing on a table! Despite a 21-year age difference, we were instant pals. The Brown family adopted me, in just about every way, and neither Larry's passing nor my move up north ever changed that – when I'm with them, I'm home.
As for writing, I've often said that my writing classroom was Larry's pickup, and my classes were the hours Larry and I spent riding Lafayette County backroads. He often traced the origins of stories and scenes on those drives, pointing out the location of some real-life event and then explaining how he'd worked it into fiction, how he'd transformed it into art. Sharing the recipe with me, in a sense.
But the greatest lesson Larry gave me, and gave every artist, was the example of his persistence. Despite years of rejection, he never stopped writing. The only failure in art, he taught me, is not making art. You must always keep working.
What do you admire about his work, and what drew you to it?
Larry Brown wrote about human frailties, about people in dire straits – emotional, romantic, financial, existential. The setting was almost always the rougher corners of north Mississippi, but the frailties were universal. Good people doing bad things, bad people doing good things. With limitless compassion, Larry sought to reconcile such human mysteries.
From the first page he liked to load his characters with trouble – he called this "sandbagging" – and then chronicle their struggles to cast off this load, like the Old Testament's God lobbing ordeals at Job. Yet by gauging what they could endure Larry showed what all of us can endure. There was a lot of darkness in Larry's work but tremendous light, too.
Why was it important to finally publish all of Brown's short work into one volume?
The hope is that this big new volume will draw a new generation to Larry Brown's work and will reboot appreciation for one of the most singular voices in American literature. The people Larry wrote about don't often appear in literary fiction, or, when they do, are rarely afforded the breadth of humanity that Larry gave them, the full bandwidth of their existence.
A young novelist from Alabama recently wrote me to say that he'd never met folks like himself and his family in books until reading his first Larry Brown book. Tim McGraw, a huge Larry fan, once told me that, unlike with most books he reads, he "recognized" the people in Larry's work.
I hope this volume kindles more moments like that. I hope it leads more readers into Larry Brown's north Mississippi, down those windy backroads. And I hope it helps to further cement his legacy as one of this state's – and for that matter this nation's – greatest writers.
What are some of your favorites among Brown's work, and why?
In putting this collection together, I was struck, anew, by his story "Samaritans," which appeared in "Facing the Music." The setup for the story sounds like a joke setup: a little kid walks into a bar. But the story veers into dark, unsettling directions, and ultimately just claws at your heart.
I've probably read it dozens of times but each time I do it feels slightly different – tonally, morally, the works. Certain paintings are like that; there's always something new to see. Likewise, certain songs. That's a hallmark of great art: it feels inexhaustibly alive.

Protection of predators: A corporate culture

Texto completo: Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill" (Little Brown) explores corporate culture concealing well-known predators from the consequences of their actions, as winsome women were "thrown under the bus" to protect powerful presences in news and entertainment. Farrow's exposé might be the 2019 Book of the Year.
Rosanna Arquette, who alleges assault by Harvey Weinstein in the early 1990s, assessed the systemic seediness as being "a cabal that was deeper and wider than Weinstein. 'This is the big boys' club, the Hollywood mafia.... They protect each other.'" Millions were spent as hush money to buy victims' silence. Prominent law firm Bois Schiller reaped huge profits to kill coverage by The New York Times while, simultaneously, representing the paper.
NBC Universal, Farrow claims, killed reporting on Weinstein because of his threats — part of supposedly widespread intimidation of parties to camouflage his deviancy — to expose misbehavior at NBC for which the television network entered nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.
NBC News Chairman Andy Lack is no stranger to Mississippi, being involved with the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics at Ole Miss and Mississippi Today. Weinstein was apparently in regular communication with Lack, and Lack had no shortage of internal exposure, given that NBC's morning news poster boy, Matt Lauer, is allegedly a variation on a theme of Weinstein: "Bottom line, it's trouble that the president of NBC News is talking directly with Harvey and lying... about it."
Lack is said to have "pursued sexual relationships with underlings and talent.... Lack was 'almost unrelenting.'" One executive stated of a corporate culture at NBC fostering predation, "The reason that you have these cultural problems — he created that!"
Lack and Lauer are not the only men accused of misbehavior at NBC News: Tom Brokaw, David Corvo, Mark Halperin, and Chris Matthews are also named in "Catch and Kill":
"Six, and then twelve, and then dozens of current and former employees gave me a similar account of a permissive atmosphere when it came to harassment by prominent men at the network. Several of the employees said that they believed the years-long pattern of settlements had allowed the behavior to continue. Some said that the problems deepened under Andy Lack's leadership. When Lack began his first tenure as president of NBC News, in the nineties, 'it was a fundamental shift of, all of a sudden, a tolerance for abusive behavior, whether it was sexually harassing or it was just verbally abusive,' Linda Vester, who raised the first complaint about Brokaw, told me. 'Degrading, humiliating talk, mainly to women. And that became the climate under Andy Lack. It was just — it was very stark.'"
The news and entertainment industry has been seen as a hotbed of sin and inquiry since the Fatty Arbuckle scandal, almost 100 years ago. I cannot speak sanctimoniously: Comcast — which owns NBCUniversal — Founder Ralph Roberts' widow Suzanne Roberts shared first-cousins with three branches of my Alabama family. Comcast's senior executive vice president is the brother-in-law of my younger sister.
Ole Miss faces a bigger conundrum: Given problems with fraternity boys vandalizing the Emmett Till Memorial and the unseemly selection of a new chancellor, Ole Miss needs no questions raised about its journalism school. "Catch and Kill" examines whether the purpose of the Fourth Estate is to protect powerful interests or ferret out truth and promote the public interest.

Texto completo: Abortion is in decline.
In a report issued last month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of abortions among women ages 15-44 dropped by 24% in the most recent 10-year window for which they have data (2007 through 2016 ), and the abortion rate -- the number of abortions per 1,000 women -- fell 26%.
These results track closely with the results of research conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization that advocates for abortion rights and surveys a different set of providers. Guttmacher's figures show the abortion rate trending steadily downward from 1981, when it peaked at 29.3 per 1,000 women, to 13.5 in 2017. That's a 54% drop in 36 years.
That's good.
Even those of us who are ardent supporters of abortion rights recognize that unintended, unwanted or medically fraught pregnancies are distressing, and that terminating them is emotionally complicated.
Better still is evidence that suggests the reason abortion is in decline is because unintended pregnancy is in decline -- better and more responsible use of improved contraceptive methods -- and not because of the spread of state laws designed to make legal abortions more difficult to nearly impossible to obtain.
If the drop in the number of abortions was the result of laws that coerced women to carry their pregnancies to term against their will or even of successful proselytizing by foes of abortion rights, you'd expect to see a rise in the overall birthrate. But in fact, a National Vital Statistics System report issued last month shows U.S. birthrates have been trending downward since the late 1990s, and in 2018, birthrates among supposedly sexually irresponsible teens hit a record low of recent decades, down 72% from their peak in 1991.
My thought was that these positive developments might be having the unintended effect of diminishing political support for abortion rights. I know that part of the reason I have always backed abortion rights is that, coming into young adulthood in the late '70s and early '80s, I knew many young women who had abortions -- women who believed that carrying an unintended pregnancy to term would derail their lives; women of great character who did not choose abortion lightly but who generally went on later to have children and careers.
Conventional wisdom is that familiarity breeds support. It's widely thought that the gay rights movement advanced as rapidly as it did because as more and more LGBTQ people publicly acknowledged their sexuality, more and more straight people realized that gay people were their co-workers, neighbors, friends, relatives and siblings, not "the other," and deserved rights and respect.
So as abortion rates continue to decline, fewer and fewer people will have a personal connection to the issue and it seems logical that support will wane.
I found only two polls to shed light on this supposition. One was a 1989 New York Times/CBS News survey that found a 19 percentage point gap (58% to 39%) between support for legal abortion among those who knew a woman who'd had an abortion and those who didn't. The other was a Pew Research Center poll in August that found a 7 percentage point gap (64% to 57%).
"We have heaps of anecdotal evidence that knowing someone who has had an abortion -- especially a close relative like a mother, sister, girlfriend or aunt -- tends to make people more pro-choice," said Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, when I asked him about this. Though he said he had no other survey data on the point, "the pro-life movement acts on the belief that this is the case."
But for whatever reason, polls taken this year show political support for abortion rights has not fallen along with abortion rates.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in July found 27% support for the idea that abortion should be "legal in all cases " -- the highest in the history of the poll dating back to 1996. Add in the "legal in most cases" responses and the total favorability number was 60%, again the highest in the history of the poll. Support for "illegal in all cases" was at 14%, a 12-year low.
A Pew Research Center poll released in August found even slightly higher support -- 61% total support for legal abortion in all (27%) or most (34%) cases. Pew also found 70% opposition to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right in most cases, up from 63% opposition in 2013.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released in June found 34% support for the idea that abortion should be "legal in all cases" and another 22% of respondents saying the procedure should be "legal most of the time," a 56% level of support that marked "a record high for the survey," according to NBC.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in May found 58% support for allowing abortion in most or all cases, up from 50% when Reuters/Ipsos asked the same question just 10 months earlier.
A Gallup poll released in June found 52% of respondents identifying as "pro-choice" (in favor of abortion rights) and 43% identifying as "pro-life" (opposed to abortion rights). It was the highest number since 2006, though "similar to the findings when the question has been asked this way since 2001," Gallup reported.
Who knows all the reasons why. But a solid majority of Americans seem to be standing up for abortion rights, even in the abstract, against the legal onslaught from the minority that would deny women those rights.
That's also good.

Re: Tweets
The winner of this week's reader poll to select the funniest tweet was, "You think Putin ever wishes we would put up more of a fight, to make it more challenging? I mean, wrecking America shouldn't be a Monday crossword puzzle," by Peter Sagal (@petersagal), host of NPR's "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me." Shortly after I posted the poll, Sagal appealed to his nearly 228,000 followers, "Longtime readers will know how much I desperately care about this silly contest. Vote as if my fragile ego depended on it." And they did!

Texto completo: How Bernie and Biden both channel an exhaustion with the experts.
In last Sunday's column, I argued that Democrats looking for someone to unify their fractious coalition should take another glance at Bernie Sanders -- on the grounds that he's more popular across the party's different factions, more unifying, more exciting and more potentially appealing to non-liberals than his critics tend to assume.
There was one point I gestured at but didn't stress, which is that in nominating Bernie, the Democrats would be embracing one of the key forces in American politics right now -- the distrust of technocracy, the sense that the smartest guys in each political coalition can't really be trusted, the feeling that the whole model of credentialed meritocracy is corrupt and self-dealing and doesn't deliver on its promises.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
In the Democratic coalition more than the Republican one, meritocracy and technocracy have long been unifying forces. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama represented somewhat different party factions, but they both embodied wonkery, a vision of competence and expertise governing to some extent above ideology, in which there are assumed to be "correct answers" to policy dilemmas that a disinterested observer could acknowledge and the right technocrat achieve.
The candidates carrying on this tradition in the Democratic primary are Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and the late-entering Michael Bloomberg -- Buttigieg and Bloomberg as center-left figures, Warren as the progressive promising to direct her "I've got a plan for that!" wonkery to more ambitious ends.
But Sanders is different; he has policy plans, too, but he's fundamentally a moralist arguing for a politics of righteous struggle, in a way that separates him from Warren as well as from Buttigieg or Bloomberg. And just as Donald Trump benefited in 2016 -- and figures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush suffered -- from a sense that the G.O.P.'s libertarian and neoconservative intelligentsia bore some responsibility for the double disasters of Iraq and the financial crisis, Sanders benefits from a widespread left-wing disappointment with what the Obama-era politics of expertise produced.
This disappointment has been strongest on health care, where Obamacare's most popular provision was the simple socialism of the Medicaid expansion rather than the complicated, expert-fashioned architecture of the exchanges. But it's also palpable in education policy, where after two decades worth of technocratic experiments -- Race to the Top, Common Core, etc. -- we have chronically disappointing test scores, persistent racial gaps, the same basic stagnation despite reformers' best-laid plans.
On both issues and others, the appeal of Sanders has less to do with the details of his plans and more to do with a simple formulation: The experts had their chance; let the moralists and radicals have theirs.
However, that's only one possible response to disillusionment with technocracy. The other response is to prefer a return to transactional politics, to dealmakers who keep the system running rather than optimizing for efficiency, to machine politicians who aren't going to dramatically improve the status quo but also aren't likely to embrace clever plans that accidentally make it worse.
This is clearly the appeal of the other non-technocrat in the Democratic field, the still-front-running Joseph Biden. Of course the former vice president also has plans and policy papers -- no Democrat lacks them -- but even more than Sanders he's running as a non-wonk, an anti-technocrat, the guy who'll shout "malarkey!" when the clever McKinsey guy shows up with the white paper and says you need to overhaul a popular program because there's a more efficient way.
Despite his constant invocations of Obama, Biden no less than Sanders (and much more than Buttigieg and Warren) is running against the Obama governmental style, and especially the first-term Obamanaut confidence in intelligence and expertise as the essential oil of governance. If Sanders woos voters by saying, why not elect a moralist instead of an expert, Biden woos them by saying, how about we just elect a [expletive] politician?
In this contrast Sanders comes out ahead with the many Democratic voters who don't think old-fashioned dealmaking is really possible anymore, and also with the important swath of disaffected voters who don't like politicians or the Democratic Party, but do want to experiment with radicalism in Washington, D.C.
But Biden's status quo-oriented version of the anti-technocratic pitch is better suited to the economic moment. America has systemic problems, certainly, but institutional sclerosis and futility are much more tolerable when the G.D.P. is running hot and unemployment is at a generational low. As long as that environment persists, there is an obvious constituency, in Biden's party and in the country, for pushing out Trump but otherwise eschewing grand ambitions, and just letting the expansion run as long as it can go.
So if the exhaustion with technocracy makes a socialist a viable nominee, that exhaustion plus a solid economy explains why the socialist may yet fall to an even more archaic breed -- a party politician.

Eating After Exercise May Provide Fat-burning Benefits

Texto completo: Working out on an empty stomach could amplify the health benefits of the activity, according to a well-timed new study of the interplay of meal timing, metabolic health and moving. The study, which involved sedentary men and moderate cycling, suggests that whether and when we eat may affect how exercise affects us.
In general, any exercise improves our health. But a wealth of recent science and personal experience indicates that different people can respond to similar exercise routines in different ways. Even if everyone completes the same amount of exercise, some people become more fit than others, or lose more weight, or gain greater control of their blood sugar.
Most exercise scientists say that our genetics, diets, physiques, temperaments and other subtle aspects of our lives act in concert to shape how our bodies react to exercise.
But some researchers suspect meal timing matters as well. Working muscles need fuel during exercise, mostly in the form of sugar (glucose) or fat. That fuel can come from our most recent meal, once its component sugars and fats reach our bloodstreams, or from our bodies’ stores of fats and sugars. We all have such stores, especially of fat, some of it residing in our muscles and marbling them like pricey sirloin.
This muscle fat becomes problematic if we accumulate too much of it. Fatty muscles do not respond well to the hormone insulin, which directs sugar from the blood into the muscles. As a result, excess fat can contribute to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels and increased risks for Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions.
So, researchers at the University of Bath in England and other institutions began to wonder whether meal timing might influence how much muscle fat we burn during exercise, which would then affect the long-term metabolic consequences of exercise and help to explain, in part, why some people get more out of exercise than others.
To look into those issues, they recruited 30 overweight, sedentary men. (They plan to do a follow-up study with women.) The researchers tested the men’s fitness and insulin sensitivity and then divided them into three groups.
One, as a control, continued their usual lives. The other two groups started supervised exercise in the morning three times a week, riding stationary bicycles at a moderate pace while wearing monitors and masks that tracked their heart rates and the amount of fat and sugar they burned. The researchers also asked them periodically how they felt while riding.
One exercise group also downed a vanilla-flavored shake two hours before the ride (with no other breakfast) while the other group swallowed a similar-tasting placebo drink, containing water, flavoring and no calories. In other words, the placebo group rode on an empty stomach, but did not know it.
After exercise, each rider received the drink he had not previously swallowed. The riders who had fasted got the shake and the other group the placebo.
This routine continued for six weeks. Afterward, the scientists crunched numbers and turned up some telling differences between the groups. As expected, the control group’s fitness and insulin sensitivity remained the same, while the men in both exercise groups had improved their fitness and narrowed their waistlines, although few had lost weight.
The riders who had pedaled on an empty stomach, however, had incinerated about twice as much fat during each ride as the men who consumed the shake first. The riders all had burned about the same number of calories while pedaling, but more of those calories came from fat when the men did not eat first.
Those riders also showed greater improvements in insulin sensitivity at the end of the study and had developed higher levels of certain proteins in their muscles that influence how well muscle cells respond to insulin and use blood sugar.
On the whole, these findings suggest that “you can probably get more out of your workout without increasing its intensity or duration by exercising before breakfast,” said Javier Gonzalez, a professor of physiology and nutrition at the University of Bath, who oversaw the new study, which appeared in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.
The reasons for this extra metabolic boost are complex but most likely involve slimming of muscle fat, he said. The fasted riders’ bodies had to turn to internal energy stores for fuel, including fat from their muscles. (Interestingly, the fasted riders did not feel as if their workouts were more draining than the other group, according to subjective ratings of their exertions.)
This study looked primarily at insulin sensitivity, though, and not other aspects of exercise and metabolism, including weight loss. (Other research by some of the same investigators have looked at how eating before exercise may affect appetite.) The researchers also could not tell whether skipping lunch before an early-evening workout would have the same effects, although it seemed likely, Gonzalez said.
“We believe that the key is the fasting period, rather than the time of day,” he said.
So, if you hope to use exercise to keep you healthy in the coming holiday period, you might try to get up and out early or after not eating for hours. But, Gonzalez said, if your schedule or preferences prevent you from exercising in the morning or on an empty stomach, do not sweat it.
“Any physical activity,” he said, whenever you can fit it in, “is better than none.”

Texto completo: We'll always have Paris. But please spare us the wealth tax.
The past three years have been hard ones for the United States, especially for anyone who cares about good governance, democratic decency and the fate of open societies.
But there's been one bright spot: an economy that defies expert predictions by continuing to deliver jobs, growth, dividends and higher wages. We were reminded of this again on Friday, with news that the economy added 266,000 new jobs last month, bringing unemployment to a 50-year low.
That being so, maybe now is not the best time for Democratic candidates to suggest we turn ourselves into an economic facsimile of France.
That's my way of reading a useful report from The Times's Jim Tankersley, who on Thursday described the ways in which Elizabeth Warren and other progressives are trying to upend decades of economic thinking by insisting that sharp tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy would accelerate growth, not depress it. Under a Warren presidency, those hikes would be accompanied by monumental increases in government spending and fundamental alterations to the structures of the private economy.
Tankersley's piece coincided with a fresh round of nationwide strikes in France, where at least 800,000 people took to the streets to protest Emmanuel Macron's attempts to modernize the country's byzantine public pension systems. At least one of these plans -- there are 42 in all -- dates to the reign of Louis XIV, and some kick in when workers retire in their fifties, costing the state an ever-mounting fortune as average lifespans get longer.
Successive French administrations of both the left and right have been trying to reform this and other aspects of the country's statist economy for decades, with limited results. Social benefits, once given, are hard to pare, much less withdraw. Hence the frequent strikes: Since 1789, French governments have been acutely sensitive to mass protests, and too often have capitulated to them.
Hence also France's perennial economic crisis.
The country's unemployment rate has not fallen below 7 percent since 1983 and is now at 8.6 percent. Long-term unemployment exceeds 40 percent, compared with 13.3 percent in the U.S. The country's annual growth rate has barely exceeded an average of 1 percent per year since the 21st century began. It's expected to come in at 1.3 percent for this year.
As of last year, the median monthly take-home pay was just $ 1,930, meaning half of all French workers make even less. It's why the country erupted in protest when Macron proposed raising fuel taxes a few cents per liter.
How much of this is a matter of the French making different, arguably better, choices when it comes to balancing work and leisure? Surely some. And how much of it is made up for by quality public services, strong worker protections, and fewer economic inequalities? Some, too.
Then again, the health service that used to be the toast of Francophiles is overwhelmed, understaffed, and "on the brink of collapse," according to a report in The Guardian. French universities, while cheap, are overcrowded, underfunded, and notoriously mediocre: "Too easy to get in and too easy to get out," as one local observer put it. French workers exercise their right to strike roughly seven times more frequently than German workers do, and 125 times more than Swiss ones.
As for income inequality, France is certainly much less unequal than the U.S. But France's top 1 percent still held 22 percent of the country's wealth at the beginning of 2018. That was despite a draconian effort by the previous Socialist government to impose a super-tax on high earners. It raised scant revenue while accelerating the exodus of the rich. Like many European attempts at imposing a wealth tax, it was quickly repealed.
All of this should stand as a stark warning to Democrats. France has the highest overall tax take among O.E.C.D. countries (46.9 percent of G.D.P.), the highest rate of government spending, (56.38 percent of G.D.P.), the highest rate of safety-net spending, and the third highest rate of pension spending.
Whatever else all this taxing and spending might be doing, it's clearly not creating jobs or prosperity. As for making people happy, France doesn't break the top 20 in this year's World Happiness Report. Even Mexico ranks higher.
I don't mean this column to be relentlessly negative about France, a great nation with an almost unsurpassed depth of culture and capacity for excellence. If anything, it's a tribute to the French that they continue to punch above their weight in so many fields, when the weight of the state lies so heavily on their backs.
But as far as models go, the story of France's economy in the past 40 years is mostly one of bad turns, thwarted hopes, and forgone opportunities. Americans should not imagine that we can walk down that same familiar cul-de-sac and not hit the same dismal dead end.

Texto completo: The U.S. government had better forget about any kind of intervention in Mexico.
MIAMI -- Mexico should not agree, under any circumstances, to host United States troops -- or those from any other country -- in its territory. It's a matter of principle, sovereignty and history.
This issue arose in the aftermath of the brutal killing in Sonora state of nine members of a local Mormon family -- six children and three women, all with dual Mexican-American citizenship. Shortly after the November massacre, the family asked President Trump to designate Mexican drug traffickers as terrorists; and Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would.
Such a designation could have severe consequences, ranging from the imposition of tariffs and sanctions on Mexico to the increasing militarization of America's southern border and more delays in the passage of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement.
However, Mexico's main concern should be the stationing of American soldiers on its soil.
For millions of Mexicans, nothing could be more worrying than the United States military operating in Mexico on the orders of a president as unpredictable as Mr. Trump, someone who has made several racist remarks about their countrymen.
According to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mr. Trump called him and offered to help. But it's clear that President Trump doesn't know Mr. López Obrador very well or the long history between the two countries. All Mexican schoolchildren are taught that their nation lost half its territory to the United States in 1848, and the pain of that loss remains fresh. The last time foreign troops were seen in Mexico was in 1914, when the Americans lay siege to the city of Veracruz -- and Mexicans don't want to see them again. President Trump had better forget about sending soldiers or troops of any kind to Mexico.
If the United States really wants to help Mexico in its war against drug traffickers, there are two very important steps it needs to take: First, control the flow of weapons from the United States into Mexico, and second, lower the American demand for narcotics.
Of course, neither of these is an easy or politically viable task. Given that the United States failed to control the spread of firearms after the school shootings at Columbine in 1999 (13 killed), Sandy Hook in 2012 (26 killed) and Parkland in 2018 (17 killed), the government will be unlikely to do anything now to stop the huge flow of firearms into Mexico. Seventy percent of the 106,000 guns seized as part of criminal investigations in Mexico between 2011 and 2016 were legally bought in the United States, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress. But Congress hasn't done anything about the problem.
It would also help Mexico if Americans would use fewer drugs. It all comes down to the dynamics of supply and demand: Mexican cartels are simply filling the orders of American consumers. Over 11 million Americans misused opioids in 2017, according to a national health survey. That same year, 5.9 million people used cocaine, and nearly 41 million people smoked marijuana. Mexican drug dealers are exploiting a vast drug market that isn't about to shrink anytime soon.
Drugs are smuggled into the United States mainly through its ports of entry. Mexican drug traffickers, particularly the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, quickly adapt to changes in consumer taste and represent "the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States," a 2018 study conducted by the Department of Justice concluded.
In this distressing political landscape, how can Mexico and the United States work together to fight drug cartels?
Both countries must continue to share strategic and financial information on criminal groups, push for extradition (nothing scares Mexican drug dealers more than the thought of spending the rest of their lives in an American prison) and tone down the criticism on social media. President Trump tweeted that it was time "to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth." But posting on Twitter is no way to rule.
President López Obrador -- who has high approval ratings after one year in power -- has been very cautious when it comes to his relationship with Mr. Trump. However, Mr. López Obrador's image as a leader would be seriously damaged if he were to accept the presence of American troops on Mexican land. His better bet is to stand firm, resist American pressure and hope for change with the 2020 election.
Unfortunately, a new president won't solve the terrible problem of drug-related violence in Mexico. Mr. López Obrador must humbly accept that his strategy -- summed up as "hugs, not bullets" -- isn't working and that urgent action is required. Instead of stopping Central American refugees from entering across Mexico's southern border, the National Guard should focus on bringing peace back to Mexico.
This year may turn out to be the most violent in Mexico's modern history. More than 33,000 homicides were recorded in 2018, with one person killed every 15 minutes. This year, 28,000 people were killed between January and October. If Mr. López Obrador doesn't make adjustments to his crime-fighting strategy soon, his six-year term could end up covered in blood.
The evident pride Mexicans feel in their president strongly opposing any foreign intervention may be undermined if Mr. López Obrador fails to crack down on drug traffickers. Saying no to President Trump's troops is a good first step. Now, Mexico's president needs to take on the other challenges confronting his country.
Mr. Trump will soon realize that he can't rule with tweets alone. His digital ruses have no effect on drug traffickers or drug-related violence in Mexico. Even someone like him, who seems to have no knowledge of history, can't take the United States back to a time when it invaded other countries whenever it wanted. As the situation in Mexico clearly shows, not everything can be solved by force or by tweet.

Texto completo: With the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s 70th anniversary summit in London, it’s fair to say that Donald Trump thinks that most alliance members, starting with France and Canada, are a bunch of ungrateful and unhelpful freeloaders. Fair to say, also, that most of those members see Trump as an erratic, pompous, dangerous simpleton.
There’s no reason they both can’t be right.
The tone of the summit was set several weeks ago, when Emmanuel Macron gave an interview to The Economist, warning of the “brain death” of NATO and wondering whether the alliance’s mutual defense commitments still meant anything. “If the Bashar al-Assad regime decides to retaliate against Turkey, will we commit ourselves under it?” the French president wondered, imagining a scenario in which Ankara could demand that other NATO members play a supportive role in its barbaric adventure in northern Syria.
Macron was widely rebuked for the remarks, most of all by Trump, who this week called them “very disrespectful,” “very, very nasty,” and “insulting to a lot of different forces.”
Yet they were also very true. Trump announced his withdrawal from Syria without bothering to consult France or Britain, both of which had special forces on the ground fighting the Islamic State. It’s Trump, not Macron, who once called NATO “obsolete,” just as it’s Trump who has repeatedly cast doubt on whether the U.S. would defend NATO states from an attack.
Words have consequences. Trump’s domestic political base may think it’s just fine to take the president seriously but not literally. Treaty allies like France can’t be so cavalier. If Macron is now exploring France’s options by talking up the prospect of a European army while talking down the threat from Russia, it’s because that’s where Trump’s wild rhetoric and behavior have led him.
But then we get to the other side of the ledger.
In 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of a “dim if not dismal future” for the alliance if states such as Germany continued to underspend on defense. Nearly eight years later, a German parliamentary report found that fewer than half of the country’s fighter jets, and not one of its six submarines, were combat worthy. The German defense minister recently announced that she does plan to meet NATO targets on military spending, but not until 2031.
To American policymakers of any administration, that sounds like something between a bald insult and a bad joke.
Most other NATO members are no better. Canada, for instance, spends just 1.27% of its gross domestic product on defense (the NATO target is 2%) and cannot meet its obligations to defend North America’s airspace. When Justin Trudeau was overheard at the summit belittling Trump for taking too long with his press conference, the Canadian prime minister sounded to many Americans like a child whining that a working parent had kept him waiting for supper.
All of this means that when Macron and other European leaders muse about creating an autonomous European defense force, they are, as one seasoned Parisian observer put it to me, “playing with cards they don’t have.” Even sizable increases in defense spending wouldn’t fill the gap that an American departure from Europe would leave: Roughly half of European defense spending goes to salaries and pensions, not warfighting capacity.
This is worse than brain death. It’s a philosophical failure, the result of a long-term attenuation in the idea of an Atlantic community — the West — united not only by a shared history or common enemies, but also by a unifying set of ethical and political ideals, and the sense that those ideals entwine our destinies.
That attenuation preceded Trump and Macron, and it has causes that go beyond any two leaders, including fundamental changes in the demographic makeup of both sides of the Atlantic. Even so, it is being accelerated by them. On Trump’s side, through his coarse nationalism, crude transactionalism, and soft spot for strongmen. On Macron’s, from an excess of political opportunism and a dearth of strategic sense. Anti-Americanism will always find a receptive audience with much of the French public. But a Europe without American protection is a continental disaster waiting to happen.
The good news is that an institution as large as NATO can run on autopilot for a long time, certainly beyond either Trump’s or Macron’s tenure of office. At some point, however, real pilots will be needed.
Is there a leader in Europe who can persuasively make the case that NATO isn’t just the cheapest available option for European security, but also the best vehicle for a liberal and democratic identity — and therefore worthy of far greater investment? And is there a leader in the U.S., Democratic or Republican, who can explain that America’s interests must be shaped by our values, and that the ultimate value, the defense of the free world against its common and perennial enemies, is our ultimate interest, too?

Everybody out of the car until you're ready to roll to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning

Texto completo: It happens every year after a snowstorm. And it's always devastating. A well-meaning parent will have a child warm up in the car while he or she digs it out. And when done with the chore, the parent gets in the toasty vehicle and sees that the child has dozed off. But tragically, that's not the case at all. The child is dead.
This nightmare scenario can even occur if the snow is not covering your tailpipe. Deadly carbon monoxide can build up underneath the car if the snow surrounding your car is higher than your exhaust pipe is. In a case such as this, you can still see your exhaust pipe, but there's a significant depression where there's hardly any snow at all under your car. Again, surrounding your car, the snow is higher than the height of the pipe. Carbon monoxide can fill the depression under the car, and seep into the passenger compartment.
Fortunately, it is very easy to avoid this horrific accident. The rule is simple. Do not start the car until it is completely dug out and you are ready to start out. Period. The kids can wait inside the house. Or, if they are helping and get cold, have them warm up in the house, NOT in the car.
Here is one awful example from the New York City area, as it first appeared in the New York Times:
"A woman and her 1-year-old son died of carbon monoxide poisoning in Passaic, N.J., on Saturday after sitting in their parked car with the engine running, the police said.
The car's exhaust pipe was buried in snow, and the woman's husband was working to shovel the car out. (Remember, in my example, above, this can happen if the pipe is not fully buried.)
Their 3-year-old daughter, who was also in the car, was in "very critical condition" on Sunday, said Detective Andy White, a spokesman for the Passaic police. Their names were not released."
Carbon monoxide is no joke. And if you don't have a carbon monoxide detector in your home, please get one. Remember, carbon monoxide cannot be seen, and has no odor. Many think that a smoke detector is sufficient. It is not.
While on the subject of vehicles, I have already seen photos this season of smashed windshields caused by ice and snow flying off of other cars or trucks. Every year, people are injured by this, and insurance claims are very significant. It is a law in New Hampshire that vehicles must be cleared of ice and snow. You can be ticketed in Maine as well. After every storm, please be courteous and take the extra few minutes to completely clear your car or truck of snow and ice.
The other thing that can happen is that the snow and ice can slide forward from your roof and then slide right down your windshield while you are driving, blinding you while you are covering the distance of a basketball court every second. That's close to the distance you travel every second when you are driving at 60 mph.
Switching gears now, I want to look at this past November in terms of heating use, which we measure by Heating Degree Days. The higher the HDD, the colder it has been. This November there were 1,100 Heating Degree Days, while last November, we saw 1,112. Normal for November at Caribou is 1,005. So each of the past two Novembers has been about 10 percent colder than normal. That means for every 10 gallons of oil you'd burn in a normal November, you've burned 11 in each of the past two Novembers.
For those who want to know how to calculate Heating Degree Days, you add the high and the low temperature observed over a midnight to midnight period (this is a climate day) and divide by two to get that day's average temperature. You then subtract it from 65 to get that day's Heating Degree Day total. The daily totals are then summed to get monthly and annual values. Here's an example. Daily high of 30, overnight low 14. Add them together to get 44. Divide by two to get the average, which is 22. Subtract 22 from 65 to get 43 Heating Degree Days. Again, the colder it is, the more Heating Degree Days you have,
One more climate note about November. It was the ninth snowiest November on record at Caribou, with 23 inches, and was one of only 13 Novembers to exceed 20 inches. Records at Caribou go back 80 years, to 1939.
And finally, a late-breaking update to our snow season before I have to hit "send" for this column. Each of the past two snow seasons have gotten off to a roaring start. Through Dec. 4, the Caribou average is 14.8 inches. Last year though Dec. 4, Caribou was already approaching three feet (35.8 inches). This year, through Dec. 4, Caribou is not far behind last year, with 33.2 inches for the season thus far.
Here's a refresher on what "normal" means. It is calculated based on a 30-year period that is recalculated every decade. So we are using 1981-2010 data, next we will be using 1991-2020 data. By the way, when talking about climate numbers, "normal" and "average" mean the same thing. So whereas I said that Caribou averages 14.8 inches of snow through Dec. 4, I also could have said that the normal snowfall through Dec. 4 for Caribou is 14.8 inches.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: He led the King's College Choir of England for 37 years, including during its famous Christmas Eve performances.
Stephen Cleobury, who for 37 years was music director at King's College, Cambridge -- which among other things meant he led one of the most beloved holiday musical events on the planet, the Christmas Eve performance by the college's celebrated choir -- died on Nov. 22 in York, England. He was 70.
Robin Tyson, his manager and a former choir member, said the cause was cancer.
Mr. Cleobury, who had stepped down from his post just this past September, was a well-regarded organist when he was named to the King's College position in 1982. In addition to leading the Choir of King's College, he oversaw assorted other choral groups and from 1995 to 2007 was chief conductor of the BBC Singers, the noted chamber choir.
But he was most often in the news in connection with the Christmas Eve performance, part of A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, a service in the King's College Chapel broadcast on hundreds of radio stations around the world.
Mr. Cleobury recorded numerous albums with the choir and toured with it regularly, maintaining and enhancing its standing as one of the great guardians of a choral tradition stretching back centuries. "The consistency and excellence of King's Choir over the years is testimony to the benefits of standards and tradition," Jeremy Eichler wrote in The New York Times in 2004, reviewing a performance at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan.
The choir is made up of boys from the King's College School and undergraduates (known as choral scholars) from Cambridge University. The Christmas Eve performance begins with a single boy stepping forward and singing the opening of "Once in Royal David's City." Mr. Cleobury, after preparing several boys for the role, would choose the soloist just moments before the performance began.
"What lies behind it is the idea that if you nominate a chorister a week or two weeks beforehand he's got quite a lot of time to get wound up about it, which we don't want to happen," Mr. Cleobury said in "A Year at King's," a BBC One film that documented the choir's 2018, culminating in the Christmas Eve concert. "And moreover, even if you do that, that particular one might wake up on Christmas Eve with a sore throat. It's really down to who's in the best voice on Christmas Eve."

A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols was a century old last year, and the choir itself dates to the 1400s, when Henry VI created it. Mr. Cleobury was supremely conscious of the tradition, and at first, as he acknowledged to NPR in 2004, felt weighed down by it.
"But I managed to get over that," he added. He had his various choirs explore new music.
"I felt that a tradition must be nourished with new material, otherwise it fossilizes," he told the British newspaper The Telegraph in 2012. "Part of what I've had in mind is to try to go to composers who would not normally be thought of as writing for church choirs but who are working in mainstream music -- operas, symphonies, chamber -- and say, 'Here's a choir, would you like to write for us?"'
As part of that exploratory spirit, each year at the festival he would introduce a new carol. Some went over better than others with a certain tradition-steeped segment of the audience.
"Could you tell me who had the idea of commissioning that carol," someone wrote to him one year when he included a carol by the modernist composer Harrison Birtwistle, "because whoever did should be locked in a dark room and never let out."
Stephen John Cleobury was born on Dec. 31, 1948, in Bromley, southeast of London. His father, John, was a doctor, and his mother, Brenda (Randall) Cleobury, was a nurse.
As a boy he was part of the choir at Worcester Cathedral. He also began studying the organ. He continued those studies at St. John's College, Cambridge, and served as organist and head of music at St. Matthew's Church in Northampton. He also taught at Northampton Grammar School.
He became sub-organist at Westminster Abbey in 1974, a position whose duties included playing for daily services and assisting in conducting the choir. In 1979 he became master of music at Westminster Cathedral.
He continued to perform on the organ after taking the King's College job and recorded numerous albums of organ music playing the King's College Chapel instrument. He was knighted this year.
Mr. Cleobury's first marriage, to Penny Holloway, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Emma (Disley) Cleobury, whom he married in 2004; their daughters, Frances and Olivia; two daughters from his first marriage, Susannah and Laura; a brother, Nicholas; and a sister, Julia.
The King's College Chapel, where many of Mr. Cleobury's recordings were made, is renowned for its acoustics; it is said that a note can reverberate for five seconds when the chapel is empty.
When it's packed with hundreds of people, as it is for the Christmas Eve festival, the resonance is not so pronounced. But, Mr. Cleobury told The Boston Globe in 1986, it has a different sort of ambience that enhances the music: "the darkness, the candlelight, the large number of people, and the curious sort of silence you get from a large number of people being quiet."

Texto completo: “Get back to business!” With this tweet, President Trump directed his secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, to stop the naval officers charged with oversight of the SEALs from disciplining one of their own. That order was confirmed the next Monday by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and over the following weekend, Mr. Spencer was fired.
There are three problems with Mr. Trump’s action. The first is that it is very much the Navy’s business — and every military’s business — to maintain, as the military so often recites and Mr. Spencer put it in his final letter to the president, “good order and discipline.” In conducting their “business,” our military services are not and must not be commanded in support of political ends, as Mr. Trump was apparently doing here.
How the president chooses to value order and discipline in his White House, and if at all, is of real concern to all Americans. But the military is not an extension of his White House. Some may argue that all actions by a president may have some political component, yet instead of constraining that component, this action by this president celebrates and encourages it.
The second problem intensifies the first. Contamination from the president’s approach is amplified when his judgment is largely shaped by television commentators and his decision announced by tweet. The military has well-established procedures for assuring good order and discipline. They begin by eliciting a judgment by peers. No one is as well positioned to balance the exigencies of combat and the demands of law and ethics as a panel of fellow sailors, Marines, airmen or soldiers.
Wise presidents let those who have made the sacrifices of combat — and who depend upon one another in combat — state first what they conclude. Such presidents provide opportunity for senior military officers and relevant civilians to add perspectives. They may not, in the end, agree. But to say at the beginning that the president mandates one and only one outcome deprecates the value of the SEALs’ judgment.
Finally, there is the judgment itself. An American service member shared a photograph of himself with a corpse along with the message: “I have got a cool story for you when I get back. I have got my knife skills on.” Our president’s endorsement of the perpetrator will be taken as a representation of our values. Our own troops, many of them teenagers, will be misled by the president’s sense, or lack of sense, of honor.
Our military engages over 1.3 million young men and women on active duty. Many will be thrust into situations of extreme risk. They, and hundreds of thousands of reservists, look to their commanders, their comrades and their training to find the proper course in the face of great challenges. All officials, and most of all presidents, should respect senior officers, the judgment of peers and the values articulated in training.
In his final letter, Mr. Spencer, a Trump appointee, put it well: “As secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business.” He added, “The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries.”
Our president should aspire to the same view. His values are not those of our military. It will do grievous damage to our armed services if they become so.

A concert to match the 'mystical quality' in famous work by John Cage

Texto completo: In February 1948, John Cage gave a lecture at an arts conference at Vassar College in which he detailed his artistic development. Somewhere in the midst of the address, he casually mentioned that, on the suggestion of a friend, he had “two years ago start[ed] writing 20 short Sonatas and Interludes which I have not yet finished."
The pieces, he added, “have all been written in my new apartment on the East River in Lower Manhattan which turns its back to the city and looks to the water and the sky."
It was a remarkably succinct precis of what would become one of Cage's most venerated works, the Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano. The image of Cage's composing space as a refuge from the tumult and commotion of New York, allowing the composer to seek a deeper and more private beauty, perfectly captures the music's mysterious aura. That rarefied character made it perhaps the closest to a canonical work in Cage's oeuvre, admired even by those who find Cage's later, chance-based music something akin to a sham. It is, in the words of Cage scholar James Pritchett, “a big piece with a quiet voice."
Last year, pianist Conor Hanick and director Zack Winokur found an innovative way to present the Sonatas and Interludes at the American Modern Opera Company's Run AMOC! Festival. Seated at a lidless piano in The Ex, the American Repertory Theater's small black box venue, with the audience surrounding him, Hanick played Cage's music while a subtle play of lighting (designed by Winokur, AMOC's co-artistic director) unfolded in the room. Choreographer Julia Eichten added an energetic dance component to the first interlude, performed largely in shadows. It was, according to the New York Times critic David Allen, “probably the best instrumental concert I have seen all year by virtue of its rethinking of the basics of what a recital might be."
“We all felt there was a mystical quality about the piece we wanted to explore in different ways," said Hanick, who will reprise “Cage" at this year's Run AMOC! “It's such a unique listening experience that I wanted the actual concertgoing act to be similar."
The Sonatas and Interludes are of central importance to Hanick, who first performed them in 2013 and has done so almost every season since. “It feels like a piece I've always known," he said via phone recently from his home in New York City. “The whole thing sounds like a whisper. There are these more resonant and clangorous moments, but I think at its heart, it's soliloquy, or a monologue, really, that is delivered in undertones."
The irony of the piece, Hanick pointed out, is that music of such otherworldly delicacy is created using the crudest of materials — screws, nuts, and bolts made of metal and rubber, all lodged in the piano strings in an arrangement that Cage lays out in the score with almost obsessive detail. (Preparing a piano for performance in this way takes around two to three hours.)
Yet Hanick found in earlier performances that following Cage's directions to the letter produced notably unsatisfying results. “You're measuring out three-and-a-half inches, you're using a furniture bolt between the first and second strings on [the note] A, you screw in the bolt, and it just sounds like a dead nothing," he said. “The note has no profile, it doesn't have a color, it just sounds like metal in a piano.
“It can't be that's what he meant," Hanick continued. “It's just inconceivable to me that he wanted the piece to sound that way." Once Hanick gave himself permission to slightly alter Cage's preparation instructions, “you just start creating these overtones and this other level of harmonicity with the instrument. And I think once that kind of becomes what you're looking for, you're getting more to the beauty of the piece."
Last year's AMOC production opened new dimensions of the Sonatas and Interludes for Hanick as well as for the audience. On one level, it allowed him to illuminate musical relationships and connections among the pieces in an unobtrusive way. But it also deepened the entire performative experience. “It draws the listener in when that's what's required, and allows the listener to pan out when that's required," he explained. “When you're sitting playing two or three sonatas in a row and the only light in the entire space is a very dim spotlight on the keyboard, it puts you in a different zone. There's no escaping what is going on in that very small space.
“The way that it's presented partly makes me play better," he added, “but it also creates this really intense cocoon for listening intently, which this piece really deserves."

Texto completo: Readers react to the annual Thanksgiving column by Maureen Dowd's conservative brother.
To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd's brother, explaining why he supports President Trump ("Kevin Talks Turkey," column, Dec. 1), begins the litany of reasons with "I support the president for his economy, the jobless rate ..." From what I hear, that view is not only to be expected from Mr. Trump's immovable supporters but also, I fear, from so many who are undecided about whom they'll vote for.
What bothers me a lot is that there's so little effort by the Democratic candidates and like-minded others to correct the false impression that the low jobless rate is President Trump's doing. It is rather a continuation from 2009, when it began declining soon after President Barack Obama's massive economic stimulus took effect, turning back the Great Recession and perhaps preventing a depression. Is that so hard to tell people?

To the Editor:
Yes, yes, it's all very well and good to print a conservative's view of liberals, of politics, of Hillary. But then at the end of the fun comes the portrayal, as usual, of people concerned with the climate crisis as tsking schoolmarms ruining everyone's fun by asking them to "consider curbing 'the carbon footprint' of our turkeys and travel."
I am really sick of this. Grow up and read a United Nations climate report, will you? I didn't invent the science in order to "turkey-shame" you.
Republicans like to snicker at Democrats for getting their "panties in a knot," but ignoring science is turning them into the party that is increasingly out of touch.

To the Editor:
Like his sister Maureen, Kevin Dowd writes with wonderful vigor. While I disagree with him heartily in his support of Donald Trump, it is refreshing to read commentary from "the other side" that is rational and not terrifying. I would welcome more of the same.
Ann Vehslage
Skillman, N.J.
To the Editor:
The annual column by Maureen Dowd's brother so deftly avoids the "big issues" -- the sheer inhumanity of the Trump administration. Thousands of children separated from their families at the border. Tax cuts resulting in a huge budget deficit, leading to cuts in safety net programs. Glorifying war criminals and white nationalists. Abandonment of the Kurds. And gross disrespect for the Constitution. Shameful and terrifying.

To the Editor:
Please let Maureen Dowd know that we'll set a place for her at our Thanksgiving table next year, with not one Donald Trump apologist in sight.

Texto completo: For the Valley News
In the beginning, pressed to feed their families on a cavewoman’s budget, our foremothers caught chickens and learned to make soup. Civilization was born, as far as I’m concerned.
And now that we’re finally able to get a chicken into just about every pot, the bird’s missing its most interesting parts.
The joys of a fresh whole chicken once included the wonderful little treasure bag of giblets tucked into its abdominal cavity. In my childhood (not all that long ago), a store-bought chicken came with its heart, lungs (fun to inflate with a straw before they got cooked), gizzard, liver, and — first among equal delights — the neck still clothed in its skin. And nice tasty soon-to-be-succulent feet were properly attached to the drumsticks.
Now our money buys an empty bird. I suspect that everything we’re not getting to enjoy ends up in manufactured food for Fluffy and Fido, and I call that a high crime with no misdemeanor about it. (Notice that processors haven’t the, uh, guts to do that to our Thanksgiving turkeys, though, because there’d be an insurrection if we Americans were deprived of some of the fixin’s for gravy.)
But chicken soup, minus the richness of organ meats and without a traditional helzel, is practically a desecration, and don’t let The New York Times (per Julia Moskin’s “A Superior Chicken Soup;” Nov. 29, 2016) try to convince you otherwise.
Helzel (Yiddish for “little throat”) is sort of a fowl-based, Ashkenazi Jewish version of haggis. Wikipedia says it’s “sometimes called ‘false’ kishke,” which seems harsh but is the literal translation of an alternate Yiddish name. Kishke is stuffed cow intestine, which I was relieved to learn is common to all Central and Eastern European cuisines and can’t be blamed on my people.
My mother, a daughter of immigrants, was more inclined to torture us with ravishing descriptions of what she ate in her own childhood than to cook such mythic meals for us, but she did, thank God, make that soup, including the poor slandered falsa kishke. Mom herself called it a gargeleh, which is another way of saying “little throat” in Yiddish.
Should you find yourself fortunately in possession of all the required components to make yourself the very best soup, do this:
Carefully remove the skin from the chicken neck, and set aside, along with some chicken fat and the liver. Put the chicken, its neck, feet, cleaned gizzard and heart into a large pot, cover with cold water, add salt (see note) to taste and vegetables of your choosing. Bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, take the reserved neck skin and sew it into a little bag with all-cotton thread. Fry some sliced onion in a bit of chicken fat and season to taste with garlic and black pepper. Mix a couple of spoonfuls of matzoh meal into a thick batter with a bit of cold water and add the fried onions. Stuff the little chicken-skin bag with the mixture, stitch the top closed and add to the simmering soup. Cook until the meat is tender, 45 minutes to an hour.
Take the liver, sprinkle with a little kosher salt, broil quickly and enjoy while you’re waiting for the soup. You can of course give it to your favorite child instead.
If you just have a craving for chicken soup, and no access to giblets, try this:
For the soup:
Chicken thighs and drumsticks, bone-in with skin
Garlic (minced, chopped or whole peeled cloves)
Fresh whole peeled ginger
Coarse salt
Turmeric
Whole coriander seeds
For serving:
Thinly-sliced bok choi (leaves and stalks)
Thinly-sliced hot peppers, seeds removed (they’re bad for your liver)
Directions: Add chicken to a large heavy-bottomed pot, skin down, and cook over very low heat until fat begins to render and there’s a fair bit of liquid in the bottom of the pot. Increase heat to medium and cook until skin is golden. Stir occasionally to ensure that the pieces don’t stick to the pot.
Add garlic and a whole piece of ginger to taste, a teaspoonful of turmeric and a teaspoonful of whole coriander seeds. Stir well and let spices become fragrant in the chicken fat and juices. Add cold water to cover and salt to taste; bring to simmer, lower heat and cook until meat is tender and the soup has a beautiful glazed appearance.
Put some sliced bok choi and hot peppers into each individual bowl, and add broth and chicken meat that you’ve pulled off the bones. Eat in good health!
Note: I’m generally not over-precious about ingredients, but I can’t cook or bake with anything except Diamond Kosher Salt. Morton’s is not equivalent. I now order that most basic of all pantry essentials via the internet.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG - For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor — the Donohues live in Akron — donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.

Paul Krugman: America’s red-state death trip

Texto completo: “E pluribus unum” — out of many, one — is one of America’s traditional mottos. And you might think it would be reflected in reality. We aren’t, after all, just united politically. We share a common language; the unrestricted movement of goods, services and people is guaranteed by the Constitution. Shouldn’t this lead to convergence in the way we live and think?
In fact, however, the past few decades have been marked by growing divergence among regions along several dimensions, all closely correlated. In particular, the political divide is also, increasingly, an economic divide. As The New York Times’ Tom Edsall put it in a recent article, “red and blue voters live in different economies.”
What Edsall didn’t point out is that red and blue voters don’t just live differently, they also die differently.
About the living part: Democratic-leaning areas used to look similar to Republican-leaning areas in terms of productivity, income and education. But they have been rapidly diverging, with blue areas getting more productive, richer and better educated. In the close presidential election of 2000, counties that supported Al Gore over George W. Bush accounted for only a little over half the nation’s economic output. In the close election of 2016, counties that supported Hillary Clinton accounted for 64% of output, almost twice the share of Trump country.
The thing is, the red-blue divide isn’t just about money. It’s also, increasingly, a matter of life and death.
Back in the Bush years I used to encounter people who insisted that the United States had the world’s longest life expectancy. They hadn’t looked at the data, they just assumed that America was No. 1 on everything. Even then it wasn’t true: U.S. life expectancy has been below that of other advanced countries for a long time.
The death gap has, however, widened considerably in recent years as a result of increased mortality among working-age Americans. This rise in mortality has, in turn, been largely a result of rising “deaths of despair”: drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol. And the rise in these deaths has led to declining overall life expectancy for the past few years.
What I haven’t seen emphasized is the divergence in life expectancy within the United States and its close correlation with political orientation. True, a recent Times article on the phenomenon noted that life expectancy in coastal metropolitan areas is still rising about as fast as life expectancy in other advanced countries. But the regional divide goes deeper than that.
A 2018 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at changes in health and life expectancy in U.S. states between 1990 and 2016. The divergence among states is striking. And as I said, it’s closely correlated with political orientation.
I looked at states that voted for Donald Trump versus states that voted for Clinton in 2016, and calculated average life expectancy weighted by their 2016 population. In 1990, today’s red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy. Since then, however, life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries, compared with almost no gain in Trump country. At this point, blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts.
Is this all about deaths of despair in the eastern heartland? No. Consider our four most populous states. In 1990, Texas and Florida had higher life expectancy than New York and almost matched California; today, they’re far behind.
What explains the divergence? Public policy certainly plays some role, especially in recent years, as blue states expanded Medicaid and drastically reduced the number of uninsured, while most red states didn’t. The growing gap in educational levels has also surely played a role: Better-educated people tend to be healthier than the less educated.
Beyond that, there has been a striking divergence in behavior and lifestyle that must be affecting mortality. For example, the prevalence of obesity has soared all across America since 1990, but obesity rates are significantly higher in red states.
One thing that’s clear, however, is that the facts are utterly inconsistent with the conservative diagnosis of what ails America.
Conservative figures like William Barr, the attorney general, look at rising mortality in America and attribute it to the collapse of traditional values — a collapse they attribute, in turn, to the evil machinations of “militant secularists.” The secularist assault on traditional values, Barr claims, lies behind “soaring suicide rates,” rising violence and “a deadly drug epidemic.”
But European nations, which are far more secularist than we are, haven’t seen a comparable rise in deaths of despair and an American-style decline in life expectancy. And even within America these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump, and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states.
So something bad is definitely happening to American society. But the conservative diagnosis of that problem is wrong — dead wrong.

Senate Republicans Warm to Theory of Ukrainian Election Interference; Some GOP senators are embracing the idea, advanced by President Trump, that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 race, despite contradictory findings

Texto completo: Some Republican lawmakers are warming to the allegation that Ukraine's government meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of any systematic effort by Ukraine to interfere.
The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has spent nearly three years investigating Russia's interference in 2016, and has released public reports that emphatically support the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow carried out an influence operation intended to boost President Trump.
That same Senate probe also examined whether Ukraine interfered in 2016, but found such claims—specifically that the government in Kyiv had ordered a top-down effort to hamper Mr. Trump's campaign—without merit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel's look at the Ukraine allegations were first reported Monday by Politico.
But Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he saw no difference between what Russia did early on to meddle in U.S. elections and what Ukrainian officials did.
"It's still meddling," Mr. Burr said, without elaborating on the nature of the meddling.
After publication of this article, Mr. Burr's office shared a statement with the Journal: "I don't believe anyone conducted the type of sophisticated election interference campaign Russia did in 2016," Mr. Burr said.
If the House impeaches Mr. Trump over his interactions with Ukraine, the Senate will serve as jury in a trial, so GOP senators' views on Ukraine's actions in 2016 could be crucial to deciding whether the president remains in office.
At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, a reporter asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he could set the record straight about whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, since there appeared to be a debate going on within his party.
"This whole issue as far as I'm concerned, is a House issue," Mr. McConnell responded. When pressed on whether he thought Ukrainian meddling was equivalent to Russian meddling, Mr. McConnell demurred.
"My view is that's something for the Senate Intelligence Committee to take a look at if they choose to," he said. "And I don't have any particular reaction to it."
Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the difference was in the scope of Russia's effort.
"I don't think anybody meddled like the Russians did but, you know, there were other countries that did things: the Iranians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians," he said.
Asked to explain the standard for meddling, Mr. Blunt said, "There's a lot of internet meddling. There's a lot of false information that comes from lots of countries. Hard to say how much of it is country-sponsored and how much of it is just done within a country."
To support the allegation of Ukrainian meddling, Republicans have pointed to a 2017 Politico article about work in 2016 by a Democratic operative and individual Ukrainian officials to investigate ties between Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an ousted former Ukrainian president. Mr. Manafort was convicted last year of dodging taxes and committing bank fraud, stemming in part from money earned from his political work in Ukraine.
At a hearing on Tuesday, David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he hadn't seen any credible evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election in 2016.
Democratic lawmakers pressed him on whether there was evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims, and whether the president's repeated allegations about Ukraine were distracting the State Department from the task of preventing Russian interference in 2020.
"It's a free country, people can debate any ideas that they want. But our focus at the State Department has been and as it should be, on the proven Russian interference in the 2016 elections and plans to do so in 2020," Mr. Hale said.
Mr. Hale added that he's seen "no credible evidence about allegations of Ukraine."
Mr. Hale's testimony aligns with the position of current and former U.S. intelligence officials, who have said they are aware of no evidence that Ukraine tried to meddle in the 2016 election in any systemic, government-backed way.
Representatives from the U.S. intelligence community told senators in a recent classified briefing that Russia for years had been engaging in a disinformation campaign intended to seed the narrative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that was responsible for the hack of Democratic emails in 2016, according to the person familiar with the matter. The contours of that private briefing was reported by the New York Times.
Sen. John Kennedy (R., LA.), didn't attend the session, but said he doesn't see a need for such a briefing.
"I don't need to be briefed to be able to read," Mr. Kennedy said. He read to reporters from print-outs of articles in Politico, The New York Times and other news outlets that he said documented Ukrainian efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.
"They meddled and Russia meddled," Mr. Kennedy said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said he had seen media reports that Ukrainian officials allegedly met somebody from the Democratic National Committee. "If there's credible evidence that people inside the Ukraine were meeting with the DNC, I'd like to know about that," he said.

Texto completo: Rigor could be restored to mainstream climate journalism with a single clause. That clause consists of the words "if climate models are accurate."
A United Nations study issued in advance of this week's climate summit in Madrid would appear in a different light, though still worrisome, and still a challenge to policy makers, if it were reported as saying: To avoid any chance of a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, annual emissions cuts of 7.6% must begin next year if computerized climate simulations are correct.
Such simulations, we should admit, are science. Their findings represent a legitimate pursuit of knowledge. The common failing in the media involves leaving out the necessary caveats. Such carelessness has ultimately enabled a new kind of science denial on the left, where advocates like Greta Thunberg and the U.K. group Extinction Rebellion increasingly talk about climate change leading to a human demise that is nowhere supported in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or other scientific bodies.
In my view, Al Gore bears heavy responsibility here. Name any important policy commitment in history -- whether Social Security or Medicare or even fighting World War II -- that required that all debate be silenced and all skeptics vilified before it could proceed. The Gore formula is good for stoking tribalism. It's not good for making policy progress in a democracy. And so it has proved. Nobody remotely believes the supposedly necessary emissions cuts will take place. The only response left to the climate crowd is to ratchet up even more dire predictions.
Let's start over. If stated properly, the "scientific consensus" would run as follows: climate models teach us to expect some warming from human-caused atmospheric CO2 increases, but disagree about how much. It's hard to make cost-benefit judgments on such a basis, but happily the Green New Deal makes it easy -- it would cost a lot of money and accomplish nothing since U.S. emissions are just 14% of the total and shrinking. India and China, not the U.S., will determine the fate of climate change.
Cost-benefit analysis also tells us a bunch of things that might be worth doing even in light of the uncertainties. A tax reform based on a revenue-neutral carbon tax could make our tax system more efficient and pro-growth. Government investment in basic research tends to have a high payoff, and battery research is a particularly attractive opportunity. Rethinking nuclear power and regulation is another area of huge potential. Safer and cheaper nuclear technologies continue to advance on the drawing board even in today's inhospitable political environment.
And guess what? All the above would be easier to sell to other countries than Green New Deal masochism. Voters would readily gobble up new energy technologies and tax models that would make their societies richer and stronger.
In honor of this week's global climate gathering in Madrid, the New York Times aptly refers to the "gap between reality and diplomacy." International agreements, by their nature, are designed to put an imprimatur on what domestic politicians would do anyway, and that doesn't include prematurely ending their careers by imposing on consumers the kind of crushing burdens the green left seeks.
Look elsewhere for the turning points that actually matter. If climate change proves as severe as some scientists believe, the most damning moment will be one that passed largely unremarked except in this column: the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown after Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany, the world's sixth biggest emitter, chaotically and thoughtlessly announced within weeks that it would close all 17 of its nuclear plants. China and India, then pursuing ambitious nuclear expansions that should have become more ambitious, instead recommitted themselves to burning vast amounts of coal.
Nuclearphobes should remind themselves that more people die each year from coal-mining accidents than have been killed in all the nuclear accidents in history. Never mind the tens of thousands who are statistically estimated to die annually from inhaling particulates. No technology is perfect, but NASA's James Hansen, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Gaia theorist James Lovelock, and the late Harvard economist Martin Weitzman are among the diverse and serious students of climate change who have said that meaningful cuts won't happen without nuclear.
The Fukushima accident, widely misread and breathing new life into the antinuclear lobby, will prove more significant than even the advocacy errors of Al Gore. It will prove more significant than the Paris Agreement, the election of Donald Trump, the tiresome legal vendetta against Exxon, or any of the matters that obsess the climate left. It probably put paid to any hope that emissions cuts will play a role in climate change for at least the next three or four decades. Get used to it.

Iran Admits Firing on Demonstrators

Texto completo: The government said security forces had fought back against "enemy cells" as demonstrations swept the country, but it said the death toll had been exaggerated.
Two weeks after protests gripped Iran -- and quickly turned deadly -- the government has acknowledged that security officers used firearms to quell the widespread demonstrations but it has denied unofficial accounts that hundreds were killed.
Iran's state television confirmed on Monday night that security forces had shot and killed protesters who had taken refuge in marshes in the southern city of Mahshahr. It described them as "armed terrorists" and praised the tactics of security forces for having crushed the unrest.
"Enemy cells were hiding in the marshes and shooting at security forces," Col. Reza Papi, a police commander in Mahshahr, told the state television broadcast.
The comments were among the first admissions by the Iranian authorities that security officers had responded to the demonstrations with lethal force.
Iranian officials on Tuesday also denounced accounts of the death toll that have emerged since the protests began, saying that the number of victims was much lower but not specifying how many.
Witnesses and residents in Mahshahr, in southern Iran's Khuzestan province, earlier had told The New York Times that dozens of men had been gunned down in the marshes and that most of them had been unarmed, except for one who did fire a shot at the security forces after they had opened fire on the men at a nearby checkpoint.
Between 180 and 450 people are believed to have been killed in the four days of violence that convulsed cities around the country when demonstrators gathered on the streets to protest a gasoline price increase announced on Nov. 15. In that same period, at least 2,000 others were injured and another 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists.
Press TV, one of Iran's state-run news outlets, on Tuesday quoted Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, as saying that the estimated casualty figures were false.
"The numbers and figures that are being provided by hostile groups are utter fabrication, and the actual figures are fewer than what these sources claim," Mr. Esmaili said, according to the news outlet. He did not offer any official figures.
At the same time, reports also surfaced of new strife -- an indication that the government's earlier assertion that the protests had ended was premature.
Press TV reported that dozens of arrests had been made in Khuzestan Province on Tuesday, citing intelligence officials. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported what appeared to have been a revenge killing of a security officer by an ethnic Arab resident of Shayegan, a working class city in Khuzestan.
There were also reports of protests and clashes in the city of Sarbaz in southeast Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan Province, one of the largest in the country. Sistan and Baluchistan, populated by mostly ethnic Baluch Iranians, borders Pakistan and has a history of popular armed uprisings against the central government. It also is home to Chahbahar port, a major shipping point developed by Indian contractors.
Social media videos and accounts in Persian media like BBC Persian showed protesters blocking a major access road to the port and security forces armed with guns and tear gas opening fire at them.
The Iranian authorities have provided little information about the extent of the protests since they began, and officials imposed a dayslong internet blackout during the crackdown that further limited the distribution of information on the violence.
They also have accused the Trump administration of encouraging the protests, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for inviting Iranians to share videos and other material purporting to document the crackdown.
President Trump, during a visit to Britain for a NATO meeting, on Tuesday weighed in on the protests, suggesting without evidence that thousands had been killed.
"Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak," he said, a statement vastly different from other estimates. "That is why they cut off the internet, so people can't see what is going on."
Political analysts said evidence of a continuing repression of protesters in Khuzestan, Sistan and Baluchistan and in the western province of Kurdistan -- all with ethnic minorities and separatist movements -- could lead to a cycle of reprisals and more violence.
Some said they also had no doubt that the central authorities in Tehran would respond with overwhelming firepower if necessary to send a message to the United States and Iran's regional adversaries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel.
"The rapid resort to brute force was aimed at demonstrating to the U.S. that the leadership in Tehran will nip any social upheaval in the bud at any cost," said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. "They now believe they have successfully proven to Washington that not only they are powerful in the region, but they are also in total control at home."

Texto completo: Some Republican lawmakers are warming to the allegation that Ukraine's government meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of any systematic effort by Ukraine to interfere.
The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has spent nearly three years investigating Russia's interference in 2016, and has released public reports that emphatically support the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow carried out an influence operation intended to boost President Trump.
That same Senate probe also examined whether Ukraine interfered in 2016, but found such claims—specifically that the government in Kyiv had ordered a top-down effort to hamper Mr. Trump's campaign—without merit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel's look at the Ukraine allegations were first reported Monday by Politico.
But Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he saw no difference between what Russia did early on to meddle in U.S. elections and what Ukrainian officials did.
"It's still meddling," Mr. Burr said, without elaborating on the nature of the meddling.
If the House impeaches Mr. Trump over his interactions with Ukraine, the Senate will serve as jury in a trial, so GOP senators' views on Ukraine's actions in 2016 could be crucial to deciding whether the president remains in office.
At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, a reporter asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he could set the record straight about whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, since there appeared to be a debate going on within his party.
"This whole issue as far as I'm concerned, is a House issue," Mr. McConnell responded. When pressed on whether he thought Ukrainian meddling was equivalent to Russian meddling, Mr. McConnell demurred.
"My view is that's something for the Senate Intelligence Committee to take a look at if they choose to," he said. "And I don't have any particular reaction to it."
Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the difference was in the scope of Russia's effort.
"I don't think anybody meddled like the Russians did but, you know, there were other countries that did things: the Iranians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians," he said.
Asked to explain the standard for meddling, Mr. Blunt said, "There's a lot of internet meddling. There's a lot of false information that comes from lots of countries. Hard to say how much of it is country-sponsored and how much of it is just done within a country."
To support the allegation of Ukrainian meddling, Republicans have pointed to a 2017 Politico article about work in 2016 by a Democratic operative and individual Ukrainian officials to investigate ties between Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an ousted former Ukrainian president. Mr. Manafort was convicted last year of dodging taxes and committing bank fraud, stemming in part from money earned from his political work in Ukraine.
At a hearing on Tuesday, David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he hadn't seen any credible evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election in 2016.
Democratic lawmakers pressed him on whether there was evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims, and whether the president's repeated allegations about Ukraine were distracting the State Department from the task of preventing Russian interference in 2020.
"It's a free country, people can debate any ideas that they want. But our focus at the State Department has been and as it should be, on the proven Russian interference in the 2016 elections and plans to do so in 2020," Mr. Hale said.
Mr. Hale added that he's seen "no credible evidence about allegations of Ukraine."
Mr. Hale's testimony aligns with the position of current and former U.S. intelligence officials, who have said they are aware of no evidence that Ukraine tried to meddle in the 2016 election in any systemic, government-backed way.
Representatives from the U.S. intelligence community told senators in a recent classified briefing that Russia for years had been engaging in a disinformation campaign intended to seed the narrative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that was responsible for the hack of Democratic emails in 2016, according to the person familiar with the matter. The contours of that private briefing was reported by the New York Times.
Sen. John Kennedy (R., LA.), didn't attend the session, but said he doesn't see a need for such a briefing.
"I don't need to be briefed to be able to read," Mr. Kennedy said. He read to reporters from print-outs of articles in Politico, The New York Times and other news outlets that he said documented Ukrainian efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.
"They meddled and Russia meddled," Mr. Kennedy said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said he had seen media reports that Ukrainian officials allegedly met somebody from the Democratic National Committee. "If there's credible evidence that people inside the Ukraine were meeting with the DNC I'd like to know about that," he said.
But Mr. Graham said he was convinced that Russia hacked the DNC server and stole Democrats' emails, not Ukraine. The theory that some of his GOP colleagues are advancing that Ukrainians hacked the DNC is hurting Mr. Trump's defense, Mr. Graham said.
"I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else," he said, adding: "I think it's always wrong to say things that can't be proven. And it can be proven it was the Russians."
Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said he hadn't had a chance to speak to Mr. Burr about his comments, but he hoped that his colleagues could stay focused on where the real threat lies.
"The only people who are advancing the discredited theory about Ukraine intervention are part of the continuing Russian disinformation campaign," said Mr. Warner. "I stand by what our committee has already said. Russia has been the sole source of this."

Texto completo: “Children of Virtue and Vengeance” (Henry Holt and Co. , 416 pp. , ½ out of four stars) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi’s West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, “Children of Blood and Bone” netted the now 26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, “Children of Blood and Bone” has been on The New York Times best-seller list for over 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY best-seller list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance. " Where “Blood and Bone” explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, “Virtue and Vengeance” places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.

The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases after the trio as well as Amari’s brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as “maggots. ”
At the end of “Blood and Bone,” Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband’s place on the throne after being killed by his daughter Amari at the end of “Blood and Bone. ”
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds between the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.

Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone. " (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces new characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: Sen. Cory Booker said he was "a little angry" that his friend Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
"We started with one of the most diverse fields in our history," the New Jersey Democrat said Tuesday on MSNBC. "It's a damn shame now that the only African American woman in this race, who has been speaking to issues that need to be brought up, is now no longer in it."
He added the Democratic field is "spiraling towards" a point where there would be "no diversity" on the December debate stage. Neither Booker, who is black, nor Julian Castro, who is Hispanic, have qualified for the next debate.
Castro, 45, slammed media coverage of Harris as being unfair during her run. "I will say that the way that the media have treated Sen. Harris in this campaign has been something else," he said. "The way they've held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate."
Harris's campaign came under criticism from campaign aides who dished dirt anonymously to Politico and the New York Times in the days leading up to her withdrawal.

America's Red State Death Trip

Texto completo: Why does falling life expectancy track political orientation?
"E pluribus unum" -- out of many, one -- is one of America's traditional mottos. And you might think it would be reflected in reality. We aren't, after all, just united politically. We share a common language; the unrestricted movement of goods, services and people is guaranteed by the Constitution. Shouldn't this lead to convergence in the way we live and think?
In fact, however, the past few decades have been marked by growing divergence among regions along several dimensions, all closely correlated. In particular, the political divide is also, increasingly, an economic divide. As The Times's Tom Edsall put it in a recent article, "red and blue voters live in different economies."
What Edsall didn't point out is that red and blue voters don't just live differently, they also die differently.
About the living part: Democratic-leaning areas used to look similar to Republican-leaning areas in terms of productivity, income and education. But they have been rapidly diverging, with blue areas getting more productive, richer and better educated. In the close presidential election of 2000, counties that supported Al Gore over George W. Bush accounted for only a little over half the nation's economic output. In the close election of 2016, counties that supported Hillary Clinton accounted for 64 percent of output, almost twice the share of Trump country.
The thing is, the red-blue divide isn't just about money. It's also, increasingly, a matter of life and death.
Back in the Bush years I used to encounter people who insisted that the United States had the world's longest life expectancy. They hadn't looked at the data, they just assumed that America was No. 1 on everything. Even then it wasn't true: U.S. life expectancy has been below that of other advanced countries for a long time.
The death gap has, however, widened considerably in recent years as a result of increased mortality among working-age Americans. This rise in mortality has, in turn, been largely a result of rising "deaths of despair": drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol. And the rise in these deaths has led to declining overall life expectancy for the past few years.
What I haven't seen emphasized is the divergence in life expectancy within the United States and its close correlation with political orientation. True, a recent Times article on the phenomenon noted that life expectancy in coastal metropolitan areas is still rising about as fast as life expectancy in other advanced countries. But the regional divide goes deeper than that.
A 2018 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at changes in health and life expectancy in U.S. states between 1990 and 2016. The divergence among states is striking. And as I said, it's closely correlated with political orientation.
I looked at states that voted for Donald Trump versus states that voted for Clinton in 2016, and calculated average life expectancy weighted by their 2016 population. In 1990, today's red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy. Since then, however, life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries, compared with almost no gain in Trump country. At this point, blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts.
Is this all about deaths of despair in the eastern heartland? No. Consider our four most populous states. In 1990, Texas and Florida had higher life expectancy than New York and almost matched California; today, they're far behind.
What explains the divergence? Public policy certainly plays some role, especially in recent years, as blue states expanded Medicaid and drastically reduced the number of uninsured, while most red states didn't. The growing gap in educational levels has also surely played a role: Better-educated people tend to be healthier than the less educated.
Beyond that, there has been a striking divergence in behavior and lifestyle that must be affecting mortality. For example, the prevalence of obesity has soared all across America since 1990, but obesity rates are significantly higher in red states.
One thing that's clear, however, is that the facts are utterly inconsistent with the conservative diagnosis of what ails America.
Conservative figures like William Barr, the attorney general, look at rising mortality in America and attribute it to the collapse of traditional values -- a collapse they attribute, in turn, to the evil machinations of "militant secularists." The secularist assault on traditional values, Barr claims, lies behind "soaring suicide rates," rising violence and "a deadly drug epidemic."
But European nations, which are far more secularist than we are, haven't seen a comparable rise in deaths of despair and an American-style decline in life expectancy. And even within America these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump, and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states.
So something bad is definitely happening to American society. But the conservative diagnosis of that problem is wrong -- dead wrong.

Billy Dee Williams And the Gender Binary

Texto completo: "I say 'himself' and 'herself,' because I also see myself as feminine as well as masculine," the actor told Esquire magazine.
The actor Billy Dee Williams has been the very embodiment of cool charisma for decades -- in real life and as the smooth-talking, cape-wearing smuggler Lando Calrissian in the "Star Wars" universe (a role he's reprising for the first time since 1983 in the upcoming "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker").
And while Williams's brand of cool has been synonymous with masculinity -- who can forget the slightly cringey machismo in those 1980s Colt 45 ads? -- in reality, Williams straddles the gender binary, according to a recent profile in Esquire magazine.
"You see, I say 'himself' and 'herself,' because I also see myself as feminine as well as masculine," Williams, 82, told Esquire. "I'm a very soft person. I'm not afraid to show that side of myself."
"I think of myself as a relatively colorful character who doesn't take himself or herself too seriously," Williams said.
When Esquire points out that Donald Glover, who played a young Calrissian in the "Solo" released in 2018, talked about the character's sexual and gender fluidity, "Williams lights up" and responds: "Really? That kid is brilliant."
Last year, shortly after Jonathan Kasdan, a writer on "Solo," confirmed that Calrissian was pansexual (being attracted to people regardless of gender or sex), Glover said: "How can you not be pansexual in space?"
While Williams, who has been married to Teruko Nakagami since the 1970s, did not outright claim to be gender fluid or otherwise, his/her embrace of gender-fluid pronouns is part of a greater revelation in Hollywood and beyond -- though among celebrities who have recently opened up about their pronouns and gender, Williams is among the oldest.
In September, the Grammy-winning singer Sam Smith, 27, who identifies as genderqueer and nonbinary, publicly announced their pronouns.
"Today is a good day so here goes," Smith wrote in an Instagram post. "I've decided I am changing my pronouns to they/them after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out."
The nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon, 35, a star on Showtime's "Billions," talked to The New York Times earlier this year about their pronouns: they/them. "I can release she/her pronouns, I can use they/them," Dillon said. "This is who I am."
And in an interview with Out Magazine in June, the "Queer Eye" star Jonathan Van Ness said that he identifies as nonbinary while retaining he/him pronouns.
"I'm gender nonconforming," he said. "Like, some days I feel like a man, but then other days I feel like a woman."

Did an Ethics Commission Leak Private Information to Cuomo?

Texto completo: An alleged leak to Mr. Cuomo, a phone call from a top legislative aide and a prolonged investigation are at the heart of Albany's latest ethics dispute.
The text messages arrived on a snowy January afternoon, a few hours after New York's state ethics commission privately debated whether to investigate a disgraced former aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. They were from a high-ranking government lawyer, sent to one of the commission members.
Was the meeting over? the lawyer asked. He had a question.
The conversation that followed is now at the heart of a brewing ethics controversy in Albany, involving an alleged leak, cover-up and pressure on supposedly independent investigative bodies. According to Julie Garcia, the commissioner who received the text, the lawyer told her that her vote during the meeting might have been leaked to Mr. Cuomo -- a possible misdemeanor.
But when the state inspector general's office investigated the matter, the office, whose head is appointed by Mr. Cuomo, decided that there was no evidence of a leak -- even though it never interviewed Mr. Cuomo, several commissioners, or Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, whose lawyer called Ms. Garcia.
In the weeks since, the allegations, many of which were first reported by The Times Union of Albany, have placed Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie under intense scrutiny. They have also reignited doubts about the independence of the ethics panel, known as the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, and the inspector general's office.
Both bodies have been accused of weak oversight, and activists, lawmakers and even commission members themselves have called for their overhaul.
"I strongly urge the governor to conduct an in-depth review of the operation of both JCOPE generally and the inspector general, and to use this as a lessons learned exercise," said Gary Lavine, one of the two commissioners who told The New York Times that they were not interviewed. "We've seen in this whole situation, the current setup is not working very well."
At the heart of the controversy is the conversation between Mr. Heastie's executive counsel, Howard Vargas, and Ms. Garcia, whom Mr. Heastie appointed to the ethics commission in 2018.
Ms. Garcia was driving home on Jan. 29, less than two hours after the close of the commission's monthly meeting, when Mr. Vargas texted her to ask if the meeting was over.
The two spoke on the phone shortly after. That was when Mr. Vargas told Ms. Garcia that the governor had suggested, in a conversation with the Assembly speaker, that she had voted against him during that meeting, Ms. Garcia said in an interview.
State law requires almost all of the commission's votes to be kept secret, and Ms. Garcia declined to say what the vote was about or how she had voted. But JCOPE officials have disclosed separately that the meeting included a vote on whether to investigate Joseph Percoco, a former top aide and confidante to Mr. Cuomo who was convicted last year of soliciting and accepting bribes. (Mr. Cuomo has denied knowledge of Mr. Percoco's actions, and prosecutors did not accuse him of wrongdoing.)
The phone call, and the notion of a leak, left Ms. Garcia reeling.
"Of course it was upsetting," Ms. Garcia said. "I was taken aback."
A spokesman for Mr. Heastie said last week that Mr. Vargas acted without instruction from the speaker. Mr. Heastie, through the spokesman, also offered condemnation of the action for the first time since the allegations became public last month.
"He does not think it was appropriate for his counsel to make this call," the spokesman, Michael Whyland, said of Mr. Heastie, adding that the speaker had instructed a lawyer for the Assembly to "conduct a review in order to outline other steps that could be taken to address this matter."
Mr. Vargas did not return a request for comment.
The day after the phone call, Ms. Garcia told JCOPE's executive director at the time, Seth Agata, about the possible leak. Mr. Agata, as required by law, reported the allegation to the inspector general's office.
The ensuing inquiry was not conducted by the chief inspector general, Letizia Tagliafierro, who previously served as executive director for JCOPE and also worked for Mr. Cuomo. Ms. Tagliafierro recused herself, and the inquiry was handled by a deputy.
In the following months, the probe seemed to leave holes.
Ms. Garcia gave a recorded interview under oath to the inspector general's office in February. But the office did not request her phone records between herself and Mr. Vargas, Ms. Garcia said, nor the text messages, which The Times reviewed.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie were never interviewed, spokesmen for the two leaders confirmed. Mr. Cuomo, at an unrelated news conference on Tuesday, defended the omission, suggesting that there was no reason for the inspector general to interview him.
"We've never had an inappropriate conversation about JCOPE," the governor said, referring to himself and Mr. Heastie.
"Remember, legally, the only legal obligation is on the commissioners not to disclose," he added. "If a commissioner called you or someone else and told you something, you could tell whoever you want. The I.G. talked to the people who have the legal obligation."
But two commissioners -- Mr. Lavine and George Weissman -- told The Times that the inspector general's office never interviewed them either. The remaining commissioners declined or did not return requests for comment.
Mr. Lavine was recused from the JCOPE matter discussed in the alleged leak, and was not privy to any related confidential information, the inspector general's office said. But Mr. Weissman did participate in the January discussions.
"I expected the I.G. would do a thorough investigation," Ms. Garcia said. "It appears I was wrong."
Lee Park, a spokesman for the inspector general's office, declined to say how many people were interviewed or how interview subjects were chosen. But in a letter laying out its investigative findings -- which the inspector general released on Wednesday, only after several reporters requested it through freedom of information laws -- the office said it had conducted "interviews, document review and analyses."
Mr. Park also said that the office obtained 30 "signed affirmations under penalty of perjury" from JCOPE commissioners and staff members at the January meeting, who swore that they "did not disclose information regarding any matter discussed in the executive session."
Ultimately, the inspector general's letter said, "no individual was able to provide firsthand knowledge of any leak or potential perpetrator; and any information provided was admittedly based on supposition and speculation."
Asked why the office did not interview Mr. Heastie or Mr. Cuomo, who might have had that firsthand knowledge, Mr. Park repeated Mr. Cuomo's argument about legal liability lying only with commissioners.
The inspector general's letter was sent to JCOPE commissioners in October. Four days later, Ms. Garcia sent a text message to Mr. Vargas -- their first communication since the January phone call. "Resigning from JCOPE today. Where should I send the letter?" she wrote.
Mr. Vargas did not ask any questions, merely sending Ms. Garcia a fax number and his email address.

Texto completo: Holly Black's Folk of the Air trilogy has been one of the most buzzed about fantasy series of recent years, and with good reason. Over the course of three books, Black has crafted a twisted, unpredictable saga of court intrigue, family drama and romantic angst. The series' final installment, The Queen of The Nothing, brings The Folk of the Air to an immensely satisfying conclusion with plenty of shocking surprises.
Jude Duarte, a mortal raised in Faerieland by her parents' murderers, is not in a good place when The Queen of Nothing begins. Exiled from the realm of Faerie, Jude schemes and plots to take back power from the wicked King Cardan, who has finally managed to get the best of her. When her twin sister Taryn appears asking for help, Jude may finally have the opportunity for revenge she craves. But a war is brewing between King Cardan and Jude's foster father, General Madoc, and Jude is soon caught up in the bloody conflict, forced to choose between protecting those she loves and satisfying her own boundless ambition.
A standout element of the Folk of the Air series is the high-stakes, love-hate tug-of-war for power between Jude and Cardan, and The Queen of Nothing takes their dynamic in a fascinating new direction as the two must join forces against Madoc. Can Jude and Cardan possibly trust one another after all the betrayals they've inflicted upon each other? And what about their undeniable mutual attraction- is it just a destructive infatuation, or something more?
None of the relationships in The Queen of Nothing are simple or easy. Jude, Taryn and their half-Faerie older sister, Vivi, were all raised by Madoc, after he killed their mother and Jude and Taryn's father, making for an extremely complicated family dynamic. Black is brilliant at writing complex, flawed characters, who, no matter how terrible their actions may be, still contain glimmers of sympathy and humanity. Madoc may be The Queen of Nothing's antagonist or may be the murderer of Jude's parents, but he's also the only father she and her sisters have ever known. Black's skillful depiction of their fraught relationship is genuinely heart-wrenching.
At its core, The Queen of Nothing is about whether people are destined to be defined by the trauma and abuse they have been subjected to, or if they are capable of rising above it. As a mortal amongst Faeries, Jude has learned to harden her heart as a matter of survival. Across the three books of Folk of the Air, readers have watched her transform into a ruthless anti-heroine willing to lie, cheat and even kill to accomplish her goals.
The Queen of Nothing is a fast-paced, addictive read with fascinating characters, immersive world-building and some truly gasp-worthy twists and turns. But it is also a hopeful, surprisingly heart-warming conclusion to the deservedly-acclaimed Folk of the Air trilogy.
"New York Times" bestselling author, Holly Black, does it again with her latest installment to the "Folk of the Air," "The Queen of Nothing."

Rice’s memoir prompts nostalgia for Obama

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Reading Susan Rice’s new memoir, “Tough Love,” is a reminder of two things: what a remarkably gifted, subtle but maddeningly distant man President Obama was; and how people like Rice who served him endured ceaseless public attacks in a country that was already on the ragged edge, though we didn’t yet know it.
Washington memoirs are most valuable for the parts that aren’t about what the author did at the office. That’s especially true of this account by the former national security adviser. The riveting passages are where Rice tells the private story that was hidden: her parents’ brutal divorce, her mother’s death, her children’s struggles with their mother’s public vilification.
Good memoirs always have a quality the Germans define as a bildungsroman, a novel of the principal character’s education in the world. That’s true with Rice’s tale: She was an African American who triumphed in the elite world of prep schools, Ivy League colleges and Rhodes Scholarships. She embodied the intellect and ambition these institutions aspired to produce, even as she masked a shattered family where her parents “fought ugly and often,” she writes, and her home life was “like a civil war battlefield.”
David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, describes the distinction between “résumé virtues,” the tokens of meritocratic success, and “eulogy virtues” that truly define someone’s character. Rice’s story and, indeed, Obama’s combine both in a compelling but sometimes unstable mix.
For all her privilege, Rice was famously pugnacious. In 1999, as a young assistant secretary of State in Bill Clinton’s administration, she gave the finger, literally, to foreign policy mandarin Richard Holbrooke, in a roomful of diplomats. In 2008, campaigning as a surrogate for Obama, she threw roundhouse rhetorical punches at his rival, Sen. John McCain (creating a feud about which she repeatedly expresses regret).
But she learned from these mistakes, partly after she began taking some heavy punches herself. She quotes (approvingly) the withering critique offered then by her Clinton administration colleague, Ambassador Howard Wolpe: “You are overly directive and intimidate others so much that you quell dissent and stifle contrary advice.”
People who’ve worked with Rice in recent years would say she had to keep re-learning that lesson of humility, and she’s still one of the few senior foreign-policy officials who regularly drops the “F-bomb.” Obama advises her at one point in the White House that her problem is that she lacks a poker face. That’s a telling criticism from Obama, who could be Mr. Cool to a fault.
Rice was battered during what should have been the zenith of her career because of the Benghazi “scandal,” which, as she re-tells it, seems an even more bizarre piece of Republican character assassination than it did at the time. She went on five network Sunday shows to explain the tragedy that had happened there, using “talking points” that had been prepared by the CIA, and was so intensely demonized that her mother and daughter both were badly traumatized.
The Benghazi fallout changed Rice’s life, probably for the better. She withdrew from consideration as secretary of state in Obama’s second term and instead became national security adviser. And she learned to subordinate her own public persona. She describes her role overseeing the National Security Council staff as playing “point guard,” a player that “is rarely the showboat or the high scorer ... but is essential to the cohesion and efficacy of the team.”
Rice acknowledges that the Obama administration’s foreign policy record was “mixed.” The flaws were perhaps most evident in the inability to find a policy that would avert the slaughter in Syria. “My heart and my conscience will forever ache over Syria,” she writes. The larger problem, she explains, is that “we suffered from a mismatch between our stated objectives and the means we were prepared to employ to achieve them — in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and, arguably, Afghanistan.” She has that right.
Behind Rice is the extraordinary figure of Obama, whom she acknowledges was “consistently the smartest guy in the room” whenever the NSC met. It’s impossible not to feel nostalgic for his intelligence and personal reticence these days, as the country is buffeted by a president whose personal qualities are a reverse image of his predecessor.
Obama, lean, austere, almost professorial in his demeanor, was a man who despised flattery and liked to pass the time playing cards, watching sports on television, and thinking about how best to make a difference in the world. How far away that moment seems.

Texto completo: The Justice Department released hundreds of pages of FBI interview notes on Monday featuring a cast of characters from President Trump’s inner circle in the latest batch of documents from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
The 295 pages of heavily redacted records, focusing on topics spanning from Trump’s frustrations with the Russia investigation and Attorney General Jeff Session’s recusal to the firing of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, are the second such tranche released through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by BuzzFeed.

Mueller’s report concluded the Kremlin interfered during the 2016 election but didn't establish any criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump's campaign.

Rick Gates, the former business partner of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, spoke with the FBI on April 18, 2018, about Flynn’s firing and Trump’s anger over Sessions. Gates said he overheard conversations that current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani wouldn’t have recused, and the agents noted, “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for Attorney General, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer currently serving a prison sentence related to lying to Congress about the timing of the proposed Trump Tower Moscow, spoke with investigators about the guidance given to him by Trump legal team member Jay Sekulow about how to respond to congressional inquiries. Cohen also responded to claims made about him in Christopher Steele’s dossier, with agents writing that “Cohen did not have any concern about the dossier allegations” and “Cohen had never been to Prague,” despite the British ex-spy’s claims.

John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, told the bureau on Aug. 2, 2018, about Trump’s anger with a New York Times story that claimed Trump told then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, which McGahn declined to do. Kelly recounted Trump’s denials about giving such an order to McGahn and his request that McGahn “correct the record,” but Kelly told investigators McGahn told him that he and Trump “did have that conversation.”

Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, told agents about Trump’s annoyance with Flynn during a Dec. 8, 2017, interview. Investigators noted, “Trump told Hicks that Obama told him to watch out for Flynn” and “Hicks thought the comment sat with Trump more then she expected.” Trump “thought Flynn had bad judgment” and “it bothered Trump that both Flynn and his son sent bad tweets,” according to investigators. An FBI interview on March 13, 2018, included Hicks discussing the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting involving Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in law Jared Kushner, and Russians that included Natalia Veselnitskaya. The agents said Hicks thought the emails setting up the meeting “looked really bad.”

Rod Rosenstein, Trump’s former deputy attorney general, spoke with investigators on May 23, 2017, one week after appointing Mueller special counsel. Rosenstein detailed the May 8, 2017, Oval Office meeting involving himself, Trump, McGahn, Sessions, Sessions’s chief of staff Jody Hunt, and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus centered around Comey, telling investigators, “I knew when I left, Director Comey would be fired.” Rosenstein was tasked with writing a memo detailing his concerns with the bureau’s leader. When Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, Rosenstein told investigators he was “angry, ashamed, horrified, and embarrassed.” Rosenstein contacted Mueller the next day.

Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and Trump campaign surrogate, told investigators on Feb. 13, 2019, about discussions he’d had with Trump in early 2017. Christie said Trump claimed, “Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over,” with Christie responding with laughter, saying, “No way.” Christie also said Trump wanted him to call Comey and tell him, “I [Trump] really like him,” but Christie thought it was a bad idea. Christie further claimed he urged Trump not to fire Mueller.

Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, spoke with bureau agents on April 6, 2018, about a mid-June 2017 meeting where Trump dictated a speech about Mueller and Russia he wanted Lewandowski to give to Sessions to deliver, the crux of which was that his attorney general should declare Trump “didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.” Lewandowski didn’t give the speech to Sessions, instead placing it in a safe at his home, though he passed a typed copy of it to White House deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn on July 19, 2017. Lewandowski provided his handwritten notes from the meeting to the FBI.

The FBI documents also included almost entirely redacted August 2018 interview notes with former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman; a July 17, 2017, interview with former acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord about Flynn; FBI special agent Peter Strzok’s interview notes with Flynn from Jan. 24, 2017; the FBI’s June 2017 evidence log about four Comey memos; former Trump campaign executive Steve Bannon’s letter from Mueller about his Jan. 18, 2019, grand jury appearance; a Think Progress article on Russia and the NRA; and 12 FBI interview notes with DOJ top official Bruce Ohr about interactions with Fusion GPS and Steele.

If You’re A Researcher Studying One-bite-is-deadly Underwater Serpents, Who You Gonna Call? The ‘fantastic Grandmothers’

Texto completo: Just over 1,000 miles from the coast of Australia lies New Caledonia, an island archipelago where the waters teem with life. This French territory, in the heart of the Coral Sea, is home to more than 9,300 marine species, including dugongs, manta rays and venomous sea snakes.
Among them is the greater sea snake, which can reach nearly 5 feet in length and is more than capable of killing a human with a single bite. But such a fearsome capability doesn’t bother Monique Zannier, 75, one of a group of seven women, ages 60-75, who snorkel regularly in Baie des Citrons, a bay in New Caledonia’s capital, Noumea.
“The Baie des Citrons is our playground,” she said. “We are in it almost daily, and we know all its nooks.”
What started as good regular exercise for Zannier has turned into a bounty of information for scientists studying the aquatic snakes. Researchers seeking new insights into the ecology of these reptiles have come to rely on the women, nicknamed the “fantastic grandmothers,” to help keep track of the hundreds of greater sea snakes that visit Noumea’s shallow-water bays.
An article published in October in the journal Ecosphere highlights the fruits of this collaboration between the team of snorkeling, senior citizen scientists and the study’s lead authors, Claire Goiran, a marine biologist at the University of New Caledonia, and Rick Shine, an evolutionary biologist at Australia’s Macquarie University.
“The grandmothers should be congratulated,” said Harold Heatwole, professor of zoology at the University of New England in Australia who was not involved in the study. “They’ve made a great contribution to science.”
Their diligent data collection, he said, has resulted in more detailed information on the ecology of greater sea snakes than is available for any other wide-ranging sea snake worldwide.
Unlike their terrestrial cousins, sea snakes are largely understudied. Most sea snakes live far offshore and are dangerous to handle, so few scientists have the means or desire to study them.
“We know very little about sea snakes,” Shine said. “Almost everything we know about them comes from ones that were accidentally caught in fishing nets.”
In 2013, Shine and Goiran set out to learn what they could about the mysterious greater sea snake. They chose the Baie des Citrons as the venue for this study, despite greater sea snakes having been seen there only six times in the past eight years. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings on their tails, so individuals can be easily identified from photographs.
With limited time to survey the bay and no full-time volunteers to assist them, Goiran and Shine got off to a slow start. During the first three years of the study, the pair managed to catalog only 45 greater sea snakes.
But that all changed in June 2017 when Goiran met Aline Guemas, a 61-year-old retiree. One morning, while Goiran was snorkeling, she saw Guemas photographing the reef with her camera.
“We started chatting in the water and I explained to her what I was doing and she told me she wanted to help,” Goiran said.
Guemas started joining Goiran on her weekly surveys, photographing sea snakes and recording their location on the reef.
“I was very happy,” Goiran said. “She did exactly what I needed her to do.”
She encouraged Guemas to recruit other retirees and, before long, she had assembled a team of seven.
“She told a friend and that friend asked another friend. It really came together by chance,” Goiran said.
Among the first to join the group was Zannier, who had taken up snorkeling as a form of physical therapy, as well as Sylvie Hebert, a 62-year-old retired nurse who has circumnavigated the globe by sailboat, and Marilyn Sarocchi, a 63-year-old gymnast with a fear of snakes.
“We meet every morning between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. We wear our diving equipment and we swim for one hour or two. Sometimes in summer, we can swim for three hours,” Sarocchi said. “Back on the beach we have tea and enjoy the beauty of the site. It is very relaxing.”
Since the group’s inception, the “fantastic grandmothers” have conducted hundreds of snorkel surveys in the Baie des Citrons and identified hundreds of greater sea snakes.
“As soon as the grandmothers set to work, we realized that we had massively underestimated the abundance of greater sea snakes in the bay,” Goiran wrote in the study.
The relationship between the grandmothers and the researchers seems to be mutually beneficial.
“We are very grateful to the scientists who let us have a part of their research,” said Genevieve Briancon, a 75-year-old retiree who joined the group shortly after its inception. “It’s very exciting. We learn a lot about sea life, and we are happy that our passion can be useful.”

Texto completo: A climate policy advisor for presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has come under attack for criticizing an ambitious vision of the Green New Deal aimed at dismantling the fossil fuel industry.
David Victor, professor of international relations at UC San Diego, caused an uproar among environmental activists last month after saying in a New York Times article that Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed climate plan "can't work in the real world."
The blowback centered on the fact that much of Victor's research over the last decade has been funded by the British oil and gas company BP and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit representing the interests of prominent energy companies.

Critics also pointed out that Victor has been paid by the Trump administration to testify in defense of the federal government in a lawsuit brought by youth claiming a failure to act on climate change violates their constitutional rights.
In response, many academics came to Victor's defense, saying the internationally recognized researcher has dedicated his life to addressing global warming. Victor has been a leading contributor to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was a player in the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at capping warming at 2 degrees Celsius.
"Based on my interaction with David, he's been extremely professional," said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a renowned climate researcher at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who has worked with Victor on a number of scientific papers and newspaper editorials.
"I've never thought that he's bringing any baggage to the table when we write," he added.
The Buttigieg campaign issued a statement to the Union-Tribune saying that Victor was a volunteer and just one of dozens of experts that contributed to the candidate's climate plan.
Victor's views on how to solve climate change highlight a significant rift among the Democratic Party and its supporters. While some see the fossil fuel industry as the enemy, others view oil and gas companies as potential partners in preventing catastrophic warming.
Victor -- who is also the co-chairman of the Brookings Institution's Initiative on Energy and Climate -- embodies the latter view.
"Some of the fossil fuel industry is going to be part of the solution," he said in a recent interview with the Union-Tribune, adding that his views were not necessarily those of the Buttigieg campaign. "We need to find as many allies in reducing carbon as possible."
In stark contrast, Sanders' climate plan -- dubbed the Green New Deal in coordination with the House resolution of the same name -- says the presidential contender will "face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action."
Victor said Sanders' approach is "guaranteed to fail politically."
Specifically, he took issue with the candidate's $16.3-trillion blueprint's goal of reaching 100% renewable energy for transportation and electricity by 2030 and fully decarbonizing the economy by 2050.
Pursuing such a vision, which calls for building government-run solar and wind farms, could waste valuable time, Victor said.
"Unless Bernie Sanders would win the presidency and win both houses with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, I don't see how he's going to get that done," he said. "These are the kinds of things that are a concern."
Rather, Victor would like to carve out room to further explore biofuels, nuclear power and carbon capture technology.
He argues that such technologies could help limit warming in the most cost-effective way possible, a crucial step for encouraging developing nations to follow suit.
"If electrification of all end uses is extremely expensive, then it might be a fun thing to do in California, but it's not relevant for a global solution," he said.
Victor's skepticism of renewable energy's potential has made him enemies -- most notably Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, whose research provided inspiration for Sanders' climate plan.
Jacobson's work has suggested that the U.S. electrical grid can run on 80% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050. According to his research, the shift -- which would include electrifying everything from cars to buildings to shipping -- is not only feasible but economical.
"In fact, if we transition to 100% renewables, the aggregate annual energy cost to all consumers would be 60% lower than it is under a fossil fuel regime," Jacobson said in an interview.
"Victor is not an expert on climate or energy plans," he added. "He's a shill for the fossil fuel industry."
Victor first raised the ire of Jacobson by co-authoring a 2017 paper that attempted to debunk the Stanford researcher's work on the feasibility of reaching 100% renewable energy.
The report, led by mathematician Christopher Clack of grid modeling firm Vibrant Clean Energy, said that Jacobson's analysis "used invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions."
Jacobson vehemently contested the paper authored by Clack, Victor and others.
When Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences declined to retract or make certain changes to the paper, Jacobson filed a lawsuit arguing that the article had damaged his credibility as a scientist by using false and misleading information. The complaint also alleged that the paper's authors failed to fully disclose their ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Citing the time and expense of the litigation, Jacobson dropped the suit in February. But the tension with Victor and others over the paper didn't end there.
Jacobson is now testifying in a federal lawsuit on behalf of 21 young people, organized under the nonprofit Our Children's Trust, who claim a failure to act on climate change violates their "rights to life, liberty, property, and public trust resources."
At the same time, Victor and two other authors on the paper are being paid by the Trump administration to testify in the case, which is known as Juliana vs. United States.
The federal government has argued that "there is no fundamental constitutional right to a stable climate system."
If the youth prevail, the government could be forced to take dramatic action to curb greenhouse gas. It would also probably set a legal precedent expanding the power of the judicial system in the context of climate change.
Victor said he opposes the lawsuit because it would violate the separation of powers between the branches of government.
"The case here is not whether the United States should make big reductions in greenhouse gases," Victor said. "Everyone agrees with that. The case here is whether the doctrine of public trust should be interpreted in an expansive way to create sort of a new set of human rights and legal obligations that would then result in the courts being able to determine large sections of energy policy."
Ann Carlson, co-director of UCLA School of Law's Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the litigation has been divisive even among those who support strong action on climate change.
"Many scholars think the litigation is ill-advised, including some highly prominent progressives," she said in an email. "Serving as an expert in the litigation does not make him ... a tool of the fossil fuel industry."

Texto completo: LONDON -- Leaked documents and interviews with whistle-blowing sources will always be a part of investigative journalism. But thanks to the rise of digital technology, and the easy availability of data that has gone with it, reporters have more ways to get stories than ever before.
"You can be on your couch in front of your computer and solve a mystery of a missile system downing a plane," said Aliaume Leroy, a journalist who is part of the BBC's Africa Eye team.
Internet sleuths who piece together stories from available data, a practice known as open-source journalism, have helped identify the white nationalists who assaulted counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va.; unmask the Russian intelligence officers who the British government said tried to kill a fellow Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England; and show that the suspects in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul included associates of Saudi Arabia's crown prince.
With its emphasis on raw facts, open-source journalism has an immediacy that is effective at a time when readers all along the ideological spectrum have become skeptical of the news media.
"If the BBC tells you they've got a source that proves this, the BBC is the middleman and the source is behind it -- you can't see it," Mr. Leroy said. "But if you've got the visual evidence, there is no middleman. You connect directly to the evidence."
The craft of building a story on publicly available data was part of journalism in the analog era, but it has come of age in recent years, with the ubiquity of smartphones and the expansion of social media.
The blogger Eliot Higgins made waves early in the decade by covering the war in Syria from a laptop in his apartment in Leicester, England, while caring for his infant daughter. In 2014, he founded Bellingcat, an open-source news outlet that has grown to include roughly a dozen staff members, with an office in The Hague. Mr. Higgins attributed his skill not to any special knowledge of international conflicts or digital data, but to the hours he had spent playing video games, which, he said, gave him the idea that any mystery can be cracked.
"It's imagination and perseverance," he said. "You look at a problem and say, 'I know I need to do this thing. I know I have this range of tools I can apply to this."'
Thanks to social media and camera-equipped smartphones, a great number of the world's seven billion people cannot help documenting newsworthy events. Open-source journalists at Bellingcat and elsewhere try to track down that evidence and place it in context.
"It's what humans do," said Nick Waters, a Bellingcat investigator. "They are gregarious. They are addicted to social media, because social media platforms are designed to be addictive. And they like sharing their experiences."
The site made a name for itself with its investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, when the war between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukraine government was raging.
At the time, Bellingcat was a group of volunteers who collaborated mainly over a Slack channel. Relying on photographs of the crash site and Facebook updates, they identified the launcher used in the attack, reporting that it had been moved from Russia to rebel-held territory in Ukraine days before the missile was fired, killing all 298 passengers on board the jet.
In June of this year, a Dutch-led international team of prosecutors indicted three men with ties to Russian military and intelligence agencies in the attack. Moscow has denied any involvement. The site produced a podcast this year detailing the story behind the story.
Hans Pool, a Dutch film director, was inspired to make a documentary about Bellingcat after its reporting on the crash. "It was about a house father in his spare time doing research on the internet," Mr. Pool said. "I was wondering, 'What is this?"' His documentary, "Truth in a Post-Truth World," recently won an International Emmy Award.
Bellingcat alumni, as well as formerly amateur open-source investigators, have found jobs at established news organizations including The New York Times, whose Visual Investigations unit incorporates open-source analysis in its reporting, and the BBC. Open-source analysis also has homes at the University of California, Berkeley, Law School; Amnesty International; the University of London's Forensic Architecture; and Storyful, a news agency bought by News Corporation in 2013.
Bellingcat journalists have spread the word about their techniques in seminars attended by journalists and law-enforcement officials. Along with grants from groups like the Open Society Foundations, founded by George Soros, the seminars are a significant source of revenue for Bellingcat, a nonprofit organization.
The melding of open-source journalism with more traditional methods can be glimpsed in the work of BBC Africa Eye. "It was obvious in 2011 and 2012 that Eliot Higgins was by some margin ahead of established media organizations in discerning from a distance what was going on in Syria," said Daniel Adamson, a BBC producer who helped introduce open-source reporting to the unit.
Africa Eye's 2018 documentary short, "Anatomy of a Killing," a winner of a Peabody Award, shows how the news unit investigated an atrocity. The group started with a viral video of soldiers shooting two women, a young girl and a baby on a dusty rural path. Tipped by an anonymous source -- a favorite tool of the old-school reporter -- Africa Eye's journalists used photos from the satellite imager DigitalGlobe to connect the silhouette of a distant mountain range seen in the video with a region of Cameroon. From there, they nailed down the coordinates to locate the murder site.
They also came up with an estimate of when the crime happened by using Google Earth photographs and treating the soldiers as walking sundials. Further, the soldiers' weaponry indicated that they were part of Cameroon's army, and Africa Eye closed in on the shooters' identities through an overheard nickname and a soldier's Facebook profile. The seven suspects are now awaiting trial.
Open-source journalism has the same vulnerabilities as traditional journalism. A biased reporter or a reliance on sources with an agenda can lead to skewed stories. Some journalists and activists hostile to what they characterize as Bellingcat's pro-Western narratives have criticized some of its coverage of the war in Syria.
At issue is an April 7, 2018, attack on Douma, Syria. Bellingcat reported, based on an analysis of six open-source videos, that it was "highly likely" that Douma civilians had died because of chemical weapons. In March, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reported that there were "reasonable grounds" to say that chemical weapons had been used in the attack.
Critics of Bellingcat have pointed to an email from an investigator with the organization, saying that it raised questions about the findings. WikiLeaks published the email on Nov. 23. In a response, Bellingcat defended its reporting, saying the final report on Douma from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reflected the concerns of the investigator whose email was published by WikiLeaks.
Open-source journalism often takes the form of the authors showing their work, a transparency that tends to make their brand of journalism more believable. The documentary "Anatomy of a Killing," for instance, is as much about how the investigators reported on the roadside shootings as the incident itself. The effect is like a magician walking you through each step of a trick.
For champions of open-source journalism, narrative transparency is crucial to the form's credibility. It has also proved useful when its practitioners are attacked by the governments they investigate.
"I've seen some very sane people tell me there weren't chemical attacks in Syria, in the same way I've seen very sane people tell me the Saudis aren't bombing civilians in Yemen -- they're just bombing military targets," said Rawan Shaif, who until recently worked on a Bellingcat project tracking Yemen's civil war. "All you need is that doubt in order for people not to believe facts."
For her, open-source journalism is an antidote to spin.
"You can show people how much information you know and how you know it," Ms. Shaif said, "and they can make their own decisions."

Texto completo: Once upon a time in New York City, two young talents set off on a near-impossible quest: a successful Broadway career. Since childhood, Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell had focused on their quest with a ferocious drive -- and learned to avoid the trolls.
In Long Island, Menzel, the daughter of a pajama salesman, spent her weekends singing at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and otherwise kept her big voice a secret. "No one knew how good I was at school because I didn't want kids to know," admits Menzel today. "I didn't want to be the one to show off."
Meanwhile in Michigan, Bell signed up for every community play and helped support her single mother by modeling underwear and karaoke machines for Kmart catalogs. Classmates would brandish shots of her in a training bra. Bell didn't care. That money would get her to Manhattan.
Both Menzel and Bell arrived at New York U.'s Tisch School of the Arts and began to audition. Menzel got to town a little earlier, and the very first gig she landed was the original Broadway production of "Rent." Her full-throated performance as the sexually fluid performance artist Maureen earned her a Tony nomination -- in part thanks to her cocky delivery of the line, "There's always going to be women in rubber flirting with me!" -- and icon status among theater fans who obsessed over the soundtrack. One of whom was Bell.
"She was such a young queen," Bell says. "She was so powerfully inspiring when I was studying music and theater at NYU."
Menzel made success seem easy. After "Rent," she inaugurated the role of the resentful green-skinned Elphaba in "Wicked," which won her that Tony, and spun her Broadway smashes into thematically adjacent roles in movies including "Kissing Jessica Stein," "Enchanted," the film version of "Rent," and, of course, "Frozen."
Even Menzel's disasters were spun into gold, as when she fell through a trapdoor during the melting scene of her next-to-last performance of "Wicked" and cracked a rib, forcing her to cancel her final show. That night, Menzel put on a track suit and swallowed enough pain medicine to walk onstage during the closing bows. Her show of strength made national headlines, including a farewell salute in The New York Times.
"You have no choice! That's just what you do!" says Menzel. As for that time John Travolta flubbed her name during the Oscars, that, too, became a blessing. "It ended up being this really wonderful mistake that helped ingratiate me to people. Anyone that didn't know me knew me now, and anyone that did know me was more supportive."
"It's hard to go unnoticed when you sing like Idina," Bell says. To most people, Menzel's career seems a string of mega-hits, as though, like her fantastic characters Elphaba and snow queen Elsa, she was born with a superpower she simply had to harness. To her, however, the fairytale story has crumpled pages.
"If you look at the time in between those jobs, they're close to a decade," Menzel says. "In those off-times, I have gotten very insecure and felt that I couldn't get a job, and was dropped from record labels, and had to go on many an auditions that I didn't get. Having a career that goes up and down has made me really appreciate when I do have success. I know the real deal -- the days where nobody is calling and you feel like crap."
As for Bell, she, too, found success fast. Bell scored her first Broadway gig as Becky Thatcher in "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" before she could graduate college. A year later, she was onstage alongside Liam Neeson and Laura Linney in a revival of "The Crucible."
"I have always been a hustler," says Bell. "I've been really, really, really lucky that at the times I was available and ready to audition, someone was in need of a 5'1" blonde with a little bit of quirk."
Bell had always planned to spend her career on the stage. Yet, now that she was a 22-year-old Broadway veteran, Bell began to think about a trip she'd taken to Los Angeles when she was 14. Though money was tight, her mother had agreed to fly her precocious daughter to meet a Hollywood agent. She and her mother walked down Hollywood Boulevard to look at the stars, and Bell was struck by how many names she didn't recognize.
"I was taken aback by the sheer number of people that have contributed to the arts here," Bell says. "It made me realize how many artists there are in the world."
She chose to stay committed to finishing high school and studying theater in New York. But when her LA-based co-stars in the Off Broadway production of "Reefer Madness" urged her to join them in California, on a whim, Bell decided to see if her happily-ever-after was on the other coast.
"I definitely heard from numerous adults in my life that cared about me, 'Have a backup plan, have a backup plan, have a backup plan.' But I also heard from some other artists, 'If you have a plan to fall back on, you'll fall back,'" says Bell.
"So I just decided to go for broke -- I've always been an optimist." Within a week, Bell booked a guest spot on "The Shield." Within a year, she was cast as the lead on "Veronica Mars."
Still, even after proving she could charm audiences in every genre from crime-fighting teenagers to bitter comedies ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall," "Bad Moms") and cerebral sitcoms ("The Good Place"), Bell was nervous when she finally met Menzel.
"I'd always looked up to her," Bell says. "You could never have convinced me that the first time I would meet her would be at her house to practice a duet to present to Disney executives after the 'Frozen' reading."
The two spent an afternoon perfecting a duet of "The Wind Beneath My Wings," the ultimate ode to sisterly love. Finally, Bell admitted that it felt surreal to sing in person alongside a voice she'd known so intimately on tape.
"She was incredibly gracious," says Bell, "but also looked at me in a way that was like, 'OK, you can be excited, but also, we're trying to get this job, so let's do the work.'"
On audition day, they sang the Bette Midler mega-hit while staring deeply into each other's eyes. At the end, according to "Frozen" director Jennifer Lee, the entire room was misty-eyed. Yet Bell says she and Menzel burst into giggles at the absurdity of sharing this big moment in a generic boardroom. "And then," says Bell, "we went on this crazy eight-year adventure together."
"Frozen" became the highest-grossing film of 2013, raking in more than $1.2 billion worldwide, and it won Oscars for animated film and original song, thanks to Menzel's showcase "Let It Go." In the past six years, the property has snowballed into books, costumes, toys, theme-park rides, Norwegian tours, holiday specials, ice skating shows, and, of course, live musical theater. And on Nov. 22, Disney released "Frozen 2," the same week that Bell and Menzel received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in a joint ceremony. That's harmony.
The two girls who dreamed of making it on Broadway will now have their names engraved into Los Angeles' Hollywood Boulevard. It's a little ironic, but the timing is apt -- particularly for Menzel, whose dramatic turn as a jilted wife in the Adam Sandler thriller "Uncut Gems" is one of the year's best surprises -- and one in which she doesn't sing a note.
"I want to push myself in all different directions. It'd be fun to let people see the other side of the Disney princess -- or queen," she corrects herself. "There is a more raw, quote-unquote, uglier side that I would not be afraid to show."
In that spirit, Bell has a pitch for Menzel when the two are octogenarians: a musical version of "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane." "That would be a nice way to go out, right?!"
"I love that she's got us booked when we're 80!" laughs Menzel when she hears of Bell's plans. "I'd like to figure out what we can do two years from now, but that's cool!"

Texto completo: On his stand-up comedy tour, Jonathan Van Ness briefly discusses starring in Netflix’s reboot of “Queer Eye.”
“I talk about punctuality, my relationship with the boys a little bit. It’s not a heavy part of my act,” Van Ness, 32, said in an interview.
Being the “Queer Eye” grooming expert has presented new career paths, including the “Road to Beijing” comedy tour.
The tour offers “just flat-out some of the most incredible opportunities and most incredible nights of my life,” Van Ness said. He rhapsodizes rapidly about getting onstage to “explore my voice and my stand-up comedy style and create a night for people to come together and laugh and just be really joyful and happy, but also mad as hell, too, about our political climate.”
When he gets political, he stresses, he does so in a “furious but joyful way. My style of comedy is storytelling with a lot of setup and punchlines. It’s storytelling, it’s very languid. I will go off the rails sometimes.”
The tour’s name, “Road to Beijing,” signifies his interest in getting to the Olympics.
“I started figure skating right around when I got to book this tour,” he says. “I was like ‘if I start figure skating now, I could maybe get to the Beijing Olympics in 2022,’ which is the next Winter Games. When I got a quarter of the way through the tour, I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I could do gymnastics onstage and no one could leave in the middle of the show.’ I’m just so happy to be doing gymnastics within my stand-up set.”
He notes the Summer Games will take place next year. “I just want to go to the Olympics somehow. Maybe comedy will get me there.”
In his act, Van Ness talks about his memoir, “Over the Top,” a bit more since the book was released in September. He worked on it for nearly two years, and he writes about his HIV-positive status, being a sexual abuse survivor and his addictions to drugs and sex. The book’s subtitle is “A Raw Journey to Self-Love,” and the writing is raw.
“I felt like I needed to be very frank to gain that understanding that I was looking for,” he said.
In an interview with The New York Times, he revealed having nightmares before the book’s release.
“The anxiety has definitely gone away, but I’m just excited to continue to work,” he said. “The book was a jumping-off point to continue my work in terms of advocacy.”
Response to the book has been “overwhelmingly positive,” he said. “It was a nerve-racking project, but I was eager to do it, and I’m glad I did. It shows there’s a lot of suffering and misunderstanding around living with HIV still. There’s a lot of work still to be done. My personal support, I feel like people were supportive and I felt a lot of love, but for people living with HIV generally, there’s still so much discrimination and stigmatizing and misunderstanding that I’m still eager to work on.”
He told The Times, “I want people to realize you’re never too broken to be fixed.”
That message is for anyone, he says. “Talking about addiction, I think there are lot of people who feel they’ve been damaged beyond repair,” he says. “I don’t think that is the case. Whether it’s anxiety, depression, addiction, whatever your compulsivity is, if you have a will to heal, you are healable, you are lovable.”
On tour, comedy is the main topic. He cites his series “Gay of Thrones,” which recaps “Game of Thrones,” in helping shape his timing, delivery, improv skills and ability to stick to a script. His approach to stand-up was influenced, he said, by “female comedians I grew up loving and watching,” notably Margaret Cho, Lisa Lampanelli, Ellen DeGeneres and Janeane Garofalo.
He credits “Queer Eye” for making his career more expansive – including the “Getting Curious” podcast – and changing his life. “Queer Eye,” which arrived last year, took him from full-time hairdresser to author, stand-up comedian and TV star.
“Before ‘Queer Eye, I was doing great, and I’m so grateful I still feel that way,” he said. “It’s opened up a lot of doors for me. It also has given me a lot more pleasure because I want to do right by this platform and by the opportunity and by my community.”

Texto completo: The holiday season is typically an indulgent time, especially when it comes to food and drink consumption. For people who struggle with body-image issues, food and weight-related health problems, including and especially eating disorders, this time of year can be stressful. We spoke with experts to offer tips that can help you navigate the season and its attendant anxieties: the meals, the parties and the people.
Be honest about who’s safe for you and who isn’t
The holiday season is one in which we find ourselves reconnecting with family and old friends we don’t often see. Gravitate toward those who are grateful and happy to see you, and away from the people who are apt to make cutting comments.
“In general, we know who’s going to be emotionally more safe for us,” said Leslie Connor, a private-practice psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware. She recommends keeping interactions with “toxic” people as brief as possible.
How can you identify toxic people? Pay attention to how conversations make you feel: Do you feel drained, or do you feel energized? Do you feel bad about yourself - or empowered?
“When we’re at a family gathering, you kind of know who’s uncensored and just going to say what they think, whether it’s kind or not,” Connor said.
Help others by creating
a welcoming environment
“I encourage people to be supportive and not to ask probing questions or give unnecessary advice,” said Ed Abramson, a professor emeritus at California State University. Comments about weight will only serve to make someone with an eating disorder or issue more defensive and create barriers to communication. “If you do want to say something,” Abramson said, “basically what you want to communicate is: ‘How can I help you?’ ”
Connor agrees. “Your job is to be welcoming, warm and accepting of the people you’re with,” she said, “and that goes a long way.” If you do have a gaffe and comment on someone’s weight, “you can always apologize,” Abramson said. “But if that’s not appropriate or it doesn’t seem to work very well, gracefully focus on something else.”
Set boundaries
ahead of time
Whitney Catalano, a registered dietitian who works with clients to improve their relationships with food and their bodies, recommends telling the people you trust about your recovery before holiday gatherings, so you can set expectations and conditions for socializing. She suggests saying something like: “Just so you know, I don’t want to get into it more than this, but I’ve been healing my relationship with food and I’m particularly sensitive to diet talk or body talk right now.” Ask them to refrain from conversations about dieting or body image. You may have to wait to have this conversation in person, but try to do it right off the bat so you don’t have to think about it.
Friends could be more amenable to your requests than family members, who may feel entitled to comment on your body and weight. Catalano said it’s important to be direct and honest with your relatives, even if they’re the ones who taught you to hate your body or fear food in the first place.
“Pick a time to have this conversation when everyone’s defenses are low,” she said. “Set boundaries for what they can and cannot talk about in front of you, and then make sure to enforce those boundaries if they cross any.”
You don’t have
to please anyone
When someone comments on your food choices, you don’t have to engage. You can respond with a slightly disinterested “Oh?” and then either turn away or ask a question - “Have you watched ‘Succession’?” - to change the topic. “You don’t have to attend every conversation you’re invited to,” said Sophie Carter-Kahn, a writer and the host of the podcast “She’s All Fat.”
It’s also important to remember that it is the other person’s choice to create the situation. “It’s not your job to smooth everything over, to make yourself smaller to accommodate someone else’s ideas of how the world should be,” she said.
Food anxiety doesn’t have to turn into food panic
Between Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving and winter holiday parties, this season can be overwhelming for anyone whose relationship with food is fraught. “The holidays are a perfect storm of food and body anxiety,” Catalano said. “Don’t be surprised if your relationship with food feels particularly out of control during this time.”
She suggests two ways to weather the storm: First make a list of people, foods and situations that are likely to trigger disordered eating patterns or negative thoughts. Second, in the moment, name the experience by acknowledging that the negative diet and body image thoughts are happening, but that they do not have to dictate your actions. “Allow it to be a challenge,” Catalano said, “while also making a promise to yourself to not make any body or lifestyle decisions from a place of panic.”
No food is ‘bad’ food
“Certain foods get demonized,” like starches or gluten or fat, Abramson said, “and that gets exacerbated when someone has an eating disorder. But a balanced diet can include occasional foods that are problematic.”
If you’re struggling with allowing yourself to enjoy “bad” foods during the holidays, try to redirect your thoughts to the benefits of the meal. “Food is not just fuel, it’s cultural, celebratory and delicious. You are allowed to eat foods just because they are delicious or emotionally nourishing,” Catalano said.
Abramson suggests a dual approach to managing food anxiety. One is the more cognitive method of telling yourself: “I can allow myself modest amounts of it and be OK.”
The other is to use anxiety-reduction techniques like deep breathing, alternating between muscle tension and muscle relaxation, meditating or praying. “Whatever an individual can learn to do to decrease anxiety would be helpful when they’re confronted with the food,” Abramson said.
Go ahead and be the judge
Catalano warns against setting strict limits on food consumption during the holidays. “The best thing you can do to prepare for holiday dinners is to eat full meals leading up to the meal and center yourself right before eating so you don’t go into it anxious. It’s normal in diet culture to restrict or starve as a way of ‘earning’ the big holiday meal, but this will only cause you to overeat and feel way worse,” she said.
One piece of advice Catalano gives her clients to help them calm down from food anxiety is to “treat your meal like you’re a judge on ‘Chopped’ or any other Food Network show. How’s the presentation? What does it smell like? How’s the texture? Do the flavors go well together? Is the food lacking any flavor? What would you rate this meal if it were presented to you on a cooking show?” This exercise, she said, can “redirect the conversation away from diet talk because you’re focusing instead on the actual experience of eating.”
Bear in mind that the only way you can maintain balance is to say no to certain things, so if you have to pass on your brother-in-law’s best friend’s ugly sweater party in order to make it to a yoga class, catch up on “Real Housewives of New Jersey” or sleep, so be it.

AJC DIGGING DEEPER COPYRIGHT DISPUTE: Supreme Court to decide if state's guide to the law should be free to the public: Case pits supporters of open records against Georgia, other states.

Texto completo: Who owns the law in Georgia?
On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court will take up that question as the justices consider whether the annotated version of Georgia code is protected under copyright law or should be made available to the public free of charge.
The hotly disputed case, pitting the state against an open records proponent, has caught the attention of the Trump administration, whose lawyers say Georgia's code should be protected. At the same time, news media and civil rights organizations are also weighing in, contending the public should have unhindered access to the state code.
What is not in dispute is whether the laws enacted by the General Assembly can be subject to copyright protection -- they can't be. But the annotated code, essentially a reference guide filled with summaries of court decisions and legal writings, is a different matter altogether.
The case began four years ago when Georgia sued California-based public records activist Carl Malamud after he refused to stop publishing the annotated code on his Public.Resource.Org website. In October 2018,
the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled in Malamud's favor, finding the code cannot receive copyright protection.
"The people ... are the source of our law" and that makes them the code's "constructive authors," the court said. "And because they are the authors, the people are the owners of these works, meaning that the works are intrinsically public domain material and, therefore, uncopyrightable."
But Georgia appealed that decision to the nation's highest court and, in June, the justices agreed to hear it.
In its legal briefs, Georgia said a private contractor -- not the Legislature -- produces the annotated code, and this arrangement warrants copyright protection.
The making of the annotated code is overseen by a state commission composed of the speaker of the House, the lieutenant governor, eight lawmakers and five members of the State Bar. The commission contracts with LexisNexis, a data collection company, to prepare the code.
The work by LexisNexis is "resource-and time-in-tensive," and the company bears the full cost of publishing the code, said the state of Georgia in its legal brief to the Supreme Court. In 2016, the state commission imposed price controls on the code, capping its cost at $404 for those who want to buy it. LexisNexis makes its money from the sales of the code.
The Trump administration, in its legal brief, said this is enough to protect the annotated code under copyright law. "The annotations were created by contractors and their employees, not legislators or their staffs," wrote U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco.
Numerous states rely on economic incentives to get companies such as LexisNexis to prepare and publish their annotated codes, said Josh Johnson, a University of Virginia law school lecturer who will argue the case Monday on Georgia's behalf.
"Ifthe(appealscourt's)decisionisaffirmed, publisherswill no longer be able to rely on sales of copyrighted works to recoup their costs for preparingannotations," saidJohnson, also a Washington attorney. "Therefore, states will either need to use taxpayer dollars to pay the publishers or stop offering annotated versions of their official codes."
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia offered similar sentiments in a legal brief filed with the high court.
In a statement emailed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Malamud said the annotated code is issued under the authority of the state. The code, he said, represents "the official law of the state of Georgia" and even the Secretary of State's seal is affixed on each volume.
"This is an edict of government," Malamud said. "We are hopeful the U.S. Supreme Court will reaffirm the long-standing principle of our democracy that the laws belong to the people and no private party can be granted a monopoly on speaking the law."
Malamud's case has received support in friend-of-the-court briefs filed by a wide variety of groups, including the American Library Association, the ACLU, the Intellectual Property Association and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which was joined by Gannett Co., the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times.
"If the First Amendment requires public access to criminal trials so that citizens may oversee and participate in government, then citizens must also have access to the laws that organize their society (and that form the basis of those criminal trials)," the media organizations said.

Texto completo: Over his career Mr. Biondi was chief executive at HBO, Viacom, Universal Studios and the television and movie division of Coca-Cola.
Frank Biondi Jr., whose financial and managerial expertise helped earn him the chief executive jobs at three entertainment giants -- HBO, Viacom and Universal Studios -- died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 74.
His daughter Anne Simonds said the cause was bladder cancer.
Unlike some of the men he worked for, Mr. Biondi was not flashy. He was a quiet deal maker known for giving savvy financial presentations and allowing executives beneath him the freedom to do their work without his interference.
"My basic job is to enhance the value of the assets and get some of the debt down," he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987, when he took over at Viacom. "It plays on the financial skills that I have had."
During his nine years with Viacom. the company acquired Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video chain. But Mr. Biondi operated in the all-enveloping shadow of Sumner Redstone, the impulsive billionaire who acquired Viacom in early 1987 and became its chairman.
"I'm C.E.O., but if you read the press, I don't exist," Mr. Biondi told The New Yorker when it profiled him in 1995. "Sumner is the embodiment of this place." Asked if his relative anonymity frustrated him, he added: "Sure. It's not his fault. It just works out that way."
But Mr. Biondi's enthusiasm about the entertainment colossus he was helping to build ended less than a year later, when Mr. Redstone fired him, reportedly over Paramount's faltering box-office performance. Mr. Biondi said his relationship with the mercurial Mr. Redstone had soured as Mr. Redstone took an increasingly hands-on role.
"We weren't having as much fun as we did eight years ago," Mr. Biondi told The Times after his dismissal.
A few months later, he was hired to run Universal Studios. Again he was at the mercy of another wealthy owner-investor, Edgar Bronfman Jr., a scion of the family that owned the Seagram distillery company; he had acquired MCA, Universal's parent company, in 1995.
But Universal's motion picture division had financial problems, and Mr. Biondi was forced out after two years in a corporate restructuring. He said at the time that Mr. Bronfman, like Mr. Redstone, had wanted to be more hands-on.
"Is it shocking? No," Mr. Biondi told The Los Angeles Times. "Is it a bit of a surprise? Sure."
Universal would be his last corporate job.
Frank Joseph Biondi Jr. was born on Jan. 9, 1945, in Manhattan and raised in Livingston, N.J. His father was a chemical engineer who had worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II and later for Bell Laboratories. His mother, Virginia (Willis) Biondi, was a homemaker.
At Princeton University, where he played center field on the baseball team, Mr. Biondi graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He earned an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School.
Mr. Biondi worked at several Wall Street brokerages and set up a financial consulting firm before he went to work in 1972 for TelePrompTer, an early cable television franchise in New York City. He left in 1973 to join the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) as assistant treasurer. The company was producing groundbreaking shows like "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company."
"They've done something remarkable in the programming business," Mr. Biondi told the Cable Center, a nonprofit educational organization, in 2000, "and here we were trying to make sure it was institutionalized."
He moved to HBO in 1978 for a programming job, and after five years was named president and chief executive. He was part of the team -- which also included Michael Fuchs, who ha brought him to the company -- that turned HBO into a television powerhouse. The close friendship between Mr. Biondi and Mr. Fuchs ended when Mr. Biondi, not Mr. Fuchs, was named chief executive.
During his time at HBO, the company, then a part of Time Inc., acquired exclusive rights to show films made by Columbia Pictures and Orion Pictures; started a new studio, Tri-Star Pictures, with Columbia and CBS; and built a new satellite uplink facility on Long Island.
Mr. Fuchs recalled in a phone interview that Mr. Biondi had not ruffled feathers and had not been a difficult outsize character, as many executives in the entertainment business were.
"He was like a unicorn," Mr. Fuchs said. "At his level he was a singular exception. At HBO, I used him as my other half; he was more conservative and financial than I am. I'm all instinct."
In October 1984, amid concerns at Time Inc. about the slowing of HBO's once dramatic subscriber growth, Mr. Biondi left over what were called "policy differences." He was replaced by Mr. Fuchs.
Soon after, Mr. Biondi resurfaced as the executive vice president of Coca-Cola's entertainment business sector, which included Columbia Pictures. He later became chairman of Coca-Cola Television. While there, his biggest deals were the acquisitions of Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio's Embassy Communications and Merv Griffin's production company.
He wasn't there long before Mr. Redstone hired him to run Viacom.
In the Cable Center interview, Mr. Biondi recalled his last encounter with Mr. Redstone.
"He said, 'I want to make a change,"' Mr. Biondi said. "'I always wanted to run my own company. It's been great. I'll be great.' It hit the tape about 4:00 right after the market closed, and about 4:05 I got a call from Edgar Bronfman."
In addition to his daughter Anne, Mr. Biondi is survived by his wife, Carol (Oughton) Biondi; another daughter, Jane Biondi Munna; six grandchildren; and a brother, Robert.
In recent years, Mr. Biondi ran a fund that invested in new media and other companies, like Tennis Channel -- an outgrowth of his devotion to playing the sport -- and sat on numerous corporate boards. In a text, Ken Solomon, the channel's president, said, "There would be no Tennis Channel without Frank Biondi."
Sherry Lansing, the former chairwoman of Paramount Pictures, remembered Mr. Biondi as a widely liked figure.
"Whether he said yes or no to you, he was beloved because he did it with such balance and respect," Ms. Lansing said by phone. "He was calm in good times and bad."

Texto completo: The NBA has removed Timofey Mozgov's $16.7 million salary from the Orlando Magic's books after approving the career-ending injury/illness waiver request the team filed last month.
Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman confirmed the league's ruling, but he declined to comment further. The league's decision will remove roughly $5.6 million from Orlando's cap this season, as well as $5.6 million from each of the next two seasons.
Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic first reported the NBA had approved Orlando's application on Wednesday.
The Magic waived Mozgov in July and stretched his $16.7 million salary, meaning the team would take a cap hit of nearly $5.6 million over three consecutive seasons starting with 2019-20. Mozgov, who helped the Cavaliers win the NBA title in 2016, was entering the final year of a four-year contract he originally signed as a free agent with the Lakers before the 2016-17 season.
Orlando acquired Mozgov from Charlotte, which got Bismack Biyombo in return, prior to the 2018-19 season as part of a three-team trade that also included Chicago. Mozgov, however, did not appear in a game for the Magic last season as he dealt with a knee injury. He had an arthroscopic procedure on the knee in January.
Not knowing if or when Mozgov was going to be able to play, Orlando decided to reduce the cap hit of his $16.7 million salary by waiving Mozgov in July and stretching his contract. Part of the money they freed up was used to sign free-agent forward Al-Farouq Aminu.
About a month later, Mozgov, 33, signed a one-year contract with Russian club Khimki Moscow but he continued to be hampered by the knee injury, according to reports. As of Wednesday, he still had not appeared in any of Khimki's 10 EuroLeague games.
The injury prompted the Magic to consider using the league's career-ending injury/illness provisions and they officially filed their application in October. Marc Stein of The New York Times was among the first to report that Orlando was seeking the waiver.
If a player is diagnosed with what is believed to be a career-ending injury or illness, his team can apply for salary cap relief one year after he last appeared in a game, according to NBA rules and the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Heat recently used the provision with Chris Bosh (blood clots).
If Mozgov were to return and play for Khimki, his salary would be put back on the Magic's cap sheet, according to Keith Smith of Yahoo! Sports.
Mozgov, who averaged 6.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest in 454 career NBA games, still will receive his remaining salary, according to reports.
Orlando, meanwhile, now sits roughly $7.8 million under the luxury tax, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. He also reports the Magic now have a $10.7 million buffer on the hard cap.
Marks also tweeted that Mozgov joins Bosh, Omer Asik, Mirza Teletovic, Nikola Pekovic and Aaron Gray as players whose salary has been removed in the past three years because of a long-term injury waiver.
The Magic could utilize the money on several fronts: to help facilitate a trade or sign a free agent this season, or use it toward future signings. It's important to keep in mind that the $5.6 million comes off the Magic's books each of the next two seasons. Third-year players Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz will be eligible for rookie-scale extensions next season.
Mozgov, meanwhile, told Russian news agency TASS in August that he felt doctors in the U.S. had misdiagnosed his injury.
"There is some progress in my knee injury recovery, although not as speedy as it should be since it is an old-time trauma," Mozgov said. "I don't want to make wrongful accusations in regard to American doctors, but their treatment of my injury was not quite correct.
"It seems to me at the moment that they have been treating me based on a wrong diagnosis. Nothing terrible has happened, but the injury has aggravated as the time went by."

Texto completo: As she took a morning stroll on the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week while attending Slugfest, a three-day conference featuring top Major League Baseball hitting coaches, Rachel Balkovec paused to greet a fellow early riser.
Was she attending the conference? the woman asked.
Yes.
"Oh?"the woman replied. "Who are you married to?"
It was the kind of stereotypical response that Balkovec, 32, has been battling for years in baseball, and one that she hopes to continue to break down when she reports to Tampa on Feb.1 to become a minor league hitting coach for the Yankees.She is believed to be the first woman hired as a full-time hitting coach by a big-league team.
Club officials said they hired Balkovec based on qualifications --including two master's degrees in the science of human movement and experience at several minor league clubs-- that were a natural fit with the coaching crew being assembled for next season. "It's an easy answer to why we chose Rachel for this role,"said Yankees hitting coordinator Dillon Lawson. "She's a good hitting coach, and a good coach, period."
Lawson met Balkovec while they were both working for the Houston Astros in 2016,he as a minor league hitting coach and she as the team's Latin American strength and conditioning coordinator.She had taught herself Spanish to be a more effective coach.
In 2018,she became the strength and conditioning coach for the Astros'Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks.

A little nostalgia for the Obama years

Texto completo: Reading Susan Rice's new memoir, 'Tough Love,' is a reminder of two things: what a remarkably gifted, subtle but maddeningly distant man President Barack Obama was; and how people such as Rice who served him endured ceaseless public attacks in a country that was already on the ragged edge, though we didn't yet know it.
Washington memoirs are most valuable for the parts that aren't about what the author did at the office. That's especially true of this account by the former national security adviser. The riveting passages are where Rice tells the private story that was hidden: her parents' brutal divorce, her mother's death, her children's struggles with their mother's public vilification.
Good memoirs always have a quality the Germans define as a bildungsroman, a novel of the principal character's education in the world. That's true with Rice's tale: She was an African American who triumphed in the elite world of prep schools, Ivy League colleges and Rhodes scholarships. She embodied the intellect and ambition these institutions aspired to produce, even as she masked a shattered family where her parents 'fought ugly and often,' she writes, and her home life was 'like a civil war battlefield.'
David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, describes the distinction between 'résumé virtues,' the tokens of meritocratic success, and 'eulogy virtues' that truly define someone's character. Rice's story and, indeed, Obama's combine both in a compelling but sometimes unstable mix.
For all her privilege, Rice was famously pugnacious. In 1999, as a young assistant secretary of state in Bill Clinton's administration, she gave the finger, literally, to foreign policy mandarin Richard Holbrooke, in a roomful of diplomats. In 2008, campaigning as a surrogate for Obama, she threw roundhouse rhetorical punches at his rival, Sen. John McCain (creating a feud about which she repeatedly expresses regret).
But she learned from these mistakes, partly after she began taking some heavy punches herself. She quotes (approvingly) the withering critique offered then by her Clinton administration colleague, Ambassador Howard Wolpe: 'You are overly directive and intimidate others so much that you quell dissent and stifle contrary advice.'
People who've worked with Rice in recent years would say she had to keep relearning that lesson of humility, and she's still one of the few senior foreign-policy officials who regularly drops the f-bomb. Obama advised her at one point in the White House that her problem was that she lacked a poker face. That's a telling criticism from Obama, who could be Mr. Cool to a fault.
Rice was battered during what should have been the zenith of her career because of the Benghazi 'scandal,' which, as she retells it, seems an even more bizarre piece of Republican character assassination than it did at the time. She went on five network Sunday shows to explain the tragedy that had happened there, using 'talking points' that had been prepared by the CIA, and was so intensely demonized that her mother and daughter both were badly traumatized.
The Benghazi fallout changed Rice's life, probably for the better. She withdrew from consideration as secretary of state in Obama's second term and instead became national security adviser. And she learned to subordinate her own public persona. She describes her role overseeing the National Security Council staff as playing 'point guard,' a player that 'is rarely the showboat or the high scorer . . . but is essential to the cohesion and efficacy of the team.'
Rice acknowledges that the Obama administration's foreign policy record was 'mixed.' The flaws were perhaps most evident in the inability to find a policy that would avert the slaughter in Syria. 'My heart and my conscience will forever ache over Syria,' she writes. The larger problem, she explains, is that 'we suffered from a mismatch between our stated objectives and the means we were prepared to employ to achieve them " in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and, arguably, Afghanistan.' She has that right.
Behind Rice is the extraordinary figure of Obama, whom she acknowledges was 'consistently the smartest guy in the room' whenever the NSC met. It's impossible not to feel nostalgic for his intelligence and personal reticence these days, as the country is buffeted by a president whose personal qualities are a reverse image of his predecessor.
Obama, lean, austere, almost professorial in his demeanor, was a man who despised flattery and liked to pass the time playing cards, watching sports on television and thinking about how best to make a difference in the world. How far away that moment seems this Thanksgiving week.

Max Chang: The University of Utah should retire Wat ‘Kilowatt’ Misaka’s number 21

Texto completo: When filmmakers Bruce Johnson and Christine Toy Johnson first embarked on their journey to document the life of Wataru (Wat) Misaka in their 2009 documentary, “Transcending: The Wat Misaka Story,” one of their first stops was the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. Wat was nowhere to be found in the hall and they were particularly surprised to see Wat absent from the NBA Diversity display. They asked to meet with the director who declined by saying, “Wat is really no more than an interesting trivia question.”
Wat passed away on Nov. 20, 2019, at the age of 95. His basketball accomplishments were well memorialized by the Salt Lake Tribune’s Kurt Kragthorpe and by The New York Times.
It was in New York where Wat helped lead the University of Utah to their only two national championships. It is now widely known that Wat, a Japanese American, was the first person of color to play in the Basketball Association of America, better known today as the National Basketball Association, and lesser known that he is the first collegiate player ever drafted into professional basketball.
I have always wondered why the university never retired Wat’s number, considering his historical significance on and off the court. Utah state Sen. Jani Iwamoto was once told that Wat’s basketball resume, “doesn’t make it through the required hoops.”
The “required hoops” are criteria drawn up several decades ago which include playing for one’s country in an international tournament; being a first team all-American and a two-time all-conference player or conference player of the year and playing four years.
Indeed, Wat does not meet any of these criteria. But context is everything.
Wat played at the University of Utah during and after World War II, winning the NCAA and NIT Championships in 1944 and 1947, respectively. While the 1944 Olympics were cancelled due to the war, it is difficult to imagine a non-white, let alone an American of Japanese descent, being named to a national team when the war in the Pacific was at its height and Japanese Americans all along the West Coast were being interned in camps including at Topaz in Delta, Utah.
Upon returning from his army service in 1946, he had to try out for the team again, even though his 1944 championship teammates, Arnie Ferrin and Dick Smuin, automatically got their roster spots back. To add Great Salt Lake salt to the wound, Coach Vadal Peterson had already re-assigned Wat’s jersey number, 21.
Wat told me that he faced relentless racial taunts at opposing gyms. Peterson ended up not starting Wat to help avoid the anti-Japanese sentiment but when he did sub Wat in, Wat would stay in for the rest of the game. If Wat wasn’t even a starter on his own team, how could he ever have been considered for first team all-American, all-conference or conference player of the year?
An Ogden native and a barber’s son, Wat, attended Weber College to save on housing and work to help pay for tuition. He ended up playing for Weber for two years, where he won MVP at a regional tournament before transferring to Utah.
The only player whose number retired by the University of Utah but did not meet all criteria is Andrew Bogut, who did not play all four years but received an exemption as for being named National Player of the Year.
Wat did hold National Player of the Year, Ralph Beard, to just one point in Utah’s 49-45 victory over the Goliath Kentucky Wildcats in the 1948 NIT Championship Game. Cal Lundquist of the United Press wrote:
“It was hard to pick the hero of the victory that they fought hardest of all to grab, but in the final analysis, little old Wat Misaka, an American-born Japanese who served with U.S. intelligence units during the war, stood out like a handful of very sore thumbs.”
Wat “Kilowatt” Misaka was more than a spark off the bench, more than a NCAA and NIT championship player and most definitely more than “an interesting answer to a trivia question.”
Wat remains a beacon for Utah basketball’s glorious and unduplicated championship seasons. He was a beacon of hope and pride for Japanese Americans, many who were unjustly incarcerated by their own government. Wat is also overwhelmingly deserving of an exception. May his beacon No. 21 permanently hang in the rafters of the University of Utah’s Huntsman Center.

As the title suggests, this underdog sports drama is about a car race: the 24 Hours of Le Mans, an annual French endurance competition that, in 1966, pitted the Ford GT40 Mark II against Ferrari's 330 P3 after Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and his lieutenant Lee Iacocca ( Jon Bernthal) got it into their heads to take on the Italians. But the central tension is between more than two car companies -- one seen as a stodgy, and unlikely, upstart, the other the flashy favorite. It's also about the conflict, and ultimate partnership, between two very different men, both racing legends and both, despite butting heads, on the same team. Damon plays the implacable American Carroll Shelby, a previous Le Mans winner brought on by Ford to design its new muscle car, and Bale is British driver Ken Miles, a hothead who Shelby hopes will be Ford's ticket to victory. (Now showing, PG-13)
'The Report'
Starring: Adam Driver,
Annette Bening, Jon Hamm. It's interesting to compare this film, inspired by the Senate staffer who wrote what's come to be known as the "Torture Report" -- an exposé of the CIA's "enhanced interrogation techniques" in the wake of 9/11 -- with "The Laundromat," the recent movie about the Panama Papers. Both films are about whistleblowing. Both were written by Scott Z. Burns (who also directs here), and both have Steven Soderbergh's fingerprints all over them. But the approaches could not be more different. Where "Laundromat" was a darkly funny comedy with lots of fourth-wall-breaking, "The Report" -- in which Driver plays an aide to Bening's Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. -- plays it completely straight. It might just be the most wonky-Washington movie ever made, one in which a whiteboard features so prominently, it deserves a screen credit. (Now showing, R)
'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'
Starring: Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys.
While last year's acclaimed Mr. Rogers documentary is still fresh in all our minds, a drama based on the late children's TV host hits theaters. Inspired by Atlanta writer Tom Junod's 1998 profile of Fred Rogers in Esquire magazine, "Beautiful Day" tells the story of the friendship that develops between Rogers (Hanks) and a cynical and slightly damaged reporter (Rhys), who has only reluctantly accepted this new assignment. Director Marielle Heller ( "The Diary of a Teenage Girl" and "Can You Ever Forgive Me?") has an obvious affinity for such flawed characters, and frames the story as an episode of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," zooming out from the miniature village featured in the opening credits of the TV show to include a tiny copy of New York City -- a metaphor for the big, scary world encompassed in Rogers's cheerful philosophy. (Now showing, PG)
'Dark Waters'
Starring: Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Camp.
Ruffalo, who also produced this true-life drama, transforms himself into the slightly nebbishy attorney Robert Bilott, who bucked his employer -- a Cincinnati law firm known for defending corporate clients -- to take on the DuPont chemical company when the drinking water in a West Virginia community appeared to have been contaminated by an ingredient used to make Teflon. Based on a 2016 New York Times article, and coming out on the heels of a new book by Bilott, the film is an effective outrage machine in the mold of "Erin Brockovich" -- a real departure for director Todd Haynes, who has never previously dipped into fact-based filmmaking. (Now showing, PG-13)
'Richard Jewell'
Starring: Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm.
Hauser, so memorable as Jeff Gillooly's co-conspirator Shawn Eckhardt in the movie "I, Tonya," takes center stage as the title character in this tale of the security guard who found a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Based on a 1997 article in Vanity Fair about how Jewell -- a chubby nobody who dreamed of becoming a cop -- went from hero to prime suspect, director Clint East-wood's latest film promises to showcase Hauser's ability to find the humanity in characters who might otherwise be easy to caricature. (Dec. 13, R)
'Bombshell' Starring: Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon.
A recommendation: Watch the 2018 documentary "Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes" before you settle into this story of the sexual harassment allegation that brought down the late, former CEO and chairman of Fox News (played here by Lithgow). Of course, the two movies are not the same thing at all. "Divide" explores Ailes's psyche, while "Bombshell" focuses on some of the women who brought accusations against him: notably Fox News anchors Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson, played by Theron and Kidman. But the Ailes doc is a useful primer, reminding viewers of just how powerfully -- and with how much impunity -- this man wielded his authority. (Dec. 20, not yet rated)

Texto completo: The journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault discusses a "worrisome development" in our democracy. Also: Child labor and chocolate; the suffering in Venezuela; Virginia's energy policy.
To the Editor:
Re "Finding the Tools to Spot, and Fight, Intolerance in Schools" (news article, Nov. 24):
Having examined this disturbing phenomenon in my "PBS News Hour" series looking at solutions to racism, let me hasten to say that intolerance is a worrisome development that is germinating in the underbelly of our democracy. And like so many other troubling challenges, it needs to be called out every bit as much as interference in our electoral processes, if not more.
Our children are our future, and while in my reporting I have found that our history -- that is, the history of all our people -- is not being taught in most schools these days, the need to combat malicious memes that are trying to fill that gap needs all the attention it can get.
Our union may never be perfect, but we owe it to our children to educate them perfectly.

The Child Labor Behind the Chocolate You Eat
To the Editor:
In "Can a Company Be Virtuous and Profitable?" (Sunday Business, Nov. 17), The Times examines how Nestlé, the world's largest food company, is attempting to prove environmental sustainability and boost revenues at the same time. But the article has a major blind spot -- overlooking Nestlé's repeated failure to eradicate exploitation in its production of chocolate.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's cocoa supply comes from West Africa, where, according to the Department of Labor, over two million children are exploited as child laborers and slaves. The world's biggest chocolate companies have repeatedly missed deadlines to eliminate child labor from their cocoa supply chains, a report this past summer found.
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights is teaching students how to take action -- by writing letters to company chief executives, urging them to protect their fellow children, and by educating their friends and neighbors by handing out fair trade chocolates and fact sheets about labor practices. The students have learned that injustice often envelops the chocolate bars and treats that they eat.
When we focus on sustainability, we need to care as much about the labor force.

Sanctions and Venezuela
To the Editor:
"Venezuelan Kids Are Dying. Are We to Blame?," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 24), describes my country's very sad reality.
Sanctions have not worked (and will not). But they give the government an excuse to blame someone other than itself.
If sanctions are here to stay, they need to be restructured in a way that will not cause suffering among ordinary citizens, like malnutrition and other medical conditions.
As Mr. Kristof reports, "the suffering is incalculable." The humanitarian catastrophe that started in Venezuela many years ago may well spread to the rest of our continent if the proper measures are not taken.

Fossil Fuels in Virginia
To the Editor:
Re "After Outcry Over Blackface, Virginia's Governor Rebounds" (front page, Nov. 12):
Virginia Democrats, having won control of the Legislature for the first time in a generation, are eager to advance their agenda by working with Gov. Ralph Northam. But viewing Virginia's off-year election in purely partisan colors obscures significant voter concerns that both parties' establishments have yet to address.
Consider this: In a bid to salvage its influence over Virginia's energy policy, Dominion Energy -- the state's biggest corporate campaign donor by far -- increased its political giving by more than 35 percent over any past election cycle this decade.
Yet this largess failed to prevent the election of nearly 50 candidates -- including all eight who flipped seats to Democrats -- who pointedly refused its money.
Until recently, taking Dominion's money and supporting its self-serving legislative proposals were widely considered de rigueur by both parties. Virginians know that Dominion has amassed hundreds of millions in excess profits as Virginia families struggle to afford their electric bills.
Rural landowners and environmental justice advocates have united in opposition to Dominion's proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline. And the fact that sinking billions of captive customer dollars into that fossil fuel project flies in the face of Governor Northam's well-received call for 100 percent zero-carbon electricity by 2050 has not gone unnoticed.
The next General Assembly, and the governor, have a clear mandate to put an end to the special favors that enrich monopoly utilities at great cost to Virginians.

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Trump knew of whistleblower complaint when he released aid to Ukraine

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump had already been briefed on a whistleblower’s complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Lawyers from the White House counsel’s office told Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the people said.
The revelation could shed light on Trump’s thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a “quid pro quo” with Kyiv. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair.
Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistleblower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to conduct investigations that could benefit Trump’s reelection chances.
The complaint from the whistleblower, a CIA officer who submitted it to the inspector general for the intelligence community in mid-August, put at the center of that pressure campaign a July 25 phone call between the presidents, which came at a time when Trump had already frozen the aid to the Ukrainian government. Trump asked that Zelenskiy “do us a favor,” then brought up the investigations he sought, alarming White House aides who conveyed their concerns to the whistleblower.

The White House declined to comment.
The whistleblower complaint, which would typically be submitted to lawmakers who have oversight of the intelligence agencies, first came to light as the subject of an administration tug of war. In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, concluded that the administration needed to send it to Congress.
But the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his deputy John Eisenberg disagreed. They decided that the administration could withhold from Congress the whistleblower’s accusations because they were protected by executive privilege. The lawyers told Trump they planned to ask the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel to determine whether they had to disclose the complaint to lawmakers.
A week later, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the administration did not have to hand over the complaint.
It is unclear how much detail the lawyers provided Trump about the complaint. The New York Times reported in September that White House advisers — namely, Cipollone and Eisenberg — knew about the whistleblower complaint in August. But the specifics of when and how Trump learned of it have not previously been reported.
The whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, accused Trump of abusing his power by inviting a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. He described the pressure campaign to get Zelenskiy to publicly commit to investigations of Democrats that could potentially benefit Trump and suggested that a temporary hold that the administration had placed on assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting a war against Russian proxy forces, might be related to the effort.
New details also emerged Tuesday about that decision to freeze the security assistance to Ukraine. An official from the White House budget office, Mark Sandy, testified that on July 12, he received an email from the office of the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, notifying him that Trump had directed that administration officials freeze Ukraine’s military aid.
Trump had enthusiastically sought the investigations for much of the summer. But in early September, he told one of his top diplomats — Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who helped carry out the shadow policy toward Ukraine — that he was not seeking “a quid pro quo” with the Ukrainian government by withholding the aid.
Sondland said that when he called Trump to inquire about why the aid had been withheld, an irritated Trump insisted he was not seeking anything from the Ukrainians. But the president said that he wanted Zelenskiy “to do the right thing,” Sondland testified to Congress last week, suggesting that he was still seeking the investigations into Democrats that could help his political fortunes.
There are discrepancies about whether Sondland spoke to the president on Sept. 7 or 9. The administration lifted the freeze on aid to Ukraine on Sept. 11, as lawmakers’ demands grew. Two days earlier, three Democratic-led House committees had opened an investigation into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.
Only days after the president learned of the whistleblower complaint, he spoke with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., about the aid holdup. Johnson sought permission to tell Zelenskiy at an upcoming meeting in Ukraine that Trump had decided to release the security assistance, according to Johnson.
Trump replied that he was not ready, Johnson said. He said he asked later on the call whether the aid was linked to some action that the president wanted the Ukrainians to take.
“Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed,” Johnson wrote in a letter this month to House Republicans.
Trump erupted in anger and began cursing, he wrote.
“‘No way,’” Trump said, according to Johnson. “‘I would never do that. Who told you that?’”
The White House has kept a tight hold on details about the actions of Trump and his senior aides in the Ukraine affair.
The president has refused to let top advisers testify in the impeachment inquiry, leaving a void that Republicans have exploited. They argue that the evidence that Democrats have gathered is insufficient because it contains few firsthand accounts linking the president to wrongdoing.
But Democrats have not only the transcript of Trump’s July 25 call but also the testimony of Sondland, who said Trump directed him and other top administration officials to maintain pressure on Ukraine.
Both Cipollone and Eisenberg, who briefed Trump in late August about the whistleblower complaint, had been following up on other complaints by administration officials about the Ukraine matter since early July.
Cipollone had suggested to Eisenberg in July that he tell Trump that White House staff members had raised concerns about a shadow Ukraine policy. Eisenberg, who does not typically brief Trump, never followed up on the suggestion.

Texto completo: As a mom with influence, Caitlin Houston felt the need to act.
Houston, of Wallingford, Connecticut, read a post on Instagram this summer by Karen Feldman, founder of the Striped Sheep, a mommy-and-me clothing company, claiming that one of her designs had been ripped off by Tuckernuck, a high-end women’s clothing retailer.
So Houston did what comes naturally to her: She posted stories about the Striped Sheep’s predicament on Instagram and encouraged friends who are mom influencers to do the same. Members of her audience — she gets roughly 34,000 views a month through her website and social media — commented on Tuckernuck’s various online platforms, demanding the company not only apologize but also explain itself. Soon Tuckernuck removed the disputed items from its website and apologized via a comment on Feldman’s Instagram page, offering her a share of profits from the products. The company also called Feldman directly to apologize.
The Striped Sheep gained thousands of new followers and sold out of its inventory. “Now I’m making six new colors in the same style, as well as a new style,” Feldman said. “It was a huge boost for me, the best thing that could have happened. It was tons of free PR.”
Tuckernuck, started by three friends who also happen to be mothers, was not as pleased.
“I think it told her story, but we were very misrepresented,” Jocelyn Gailliot, chief executive and a founder of Tuckernuck, said of the situation. She declined to provide details, adding: “But we are a positive brand, a happy brand, and we are women who have children. We don’t feel social media is the right place to engage over this, and it’s a bad precedent to set for future generations.”
There are 4.5 million mom influencers in the United States, according to Mom 2.0, a conference that brings them together. They use websites and social media to record seemingly every detail of their lives: the sweater they bought for the fall, their child’s favorite new toy, which coffee helps them wake up. What began, for many, as a creative outlet or a way to build community has morphed over the years into big business with a more direct link to brands and companies.
Their followers spend money on the items they endorse and boycott the ones they pan. (Some influencers receive money if people buy products after clicking on the links they provide, and they sometimes have sponsorship deals with brands.) Millennial mothers are 18% more likely than those from Generation X to rely on advice from their fellow moms, according to research done by Mom 2.0.
“People think: ‘This woman also drives around four kids and gets crumbs in her seat. She is just like me, so I am going to listen to her,’ ” said Elisa Camahort Page, a co-founder and former chief operating officer of BlogHer, a media company that put on events and acted as a publisher for female content creators.
Influential moms have been using their power to pressure brands for at least a decade. Heather B. Armstrong, who lives in Salt Lake City and runs a website that receives 250,000 views a month, discovered her power in 2009 after buying a $1,300 Maytag washing machine that kept breaking. After her interactions with customer service and corporate headquarters frustrated her, she posted five tweets that other mom influencers picked up.
“Within 12 hours, someone from headquarters called me, and then they flew someone out to fix my washing machine,” said Armstrong, who is known as Dooce to her followers. “I got their attention.”
But with influence comes responsibility, and some have raised questions about when and how mom influencers should use their power. How much research should be done before discussing a brand? What constitutes an experience worth sharing? What is, in other words, proper mom influencer etiquette?
“We have to look out for each other,” Houston said. “If I see a mom who has started a business and is now getting squashed by a bigger person, I want to use the influence I have.”
She acknowledged that in the Striped Sheep situation her research did not extend beyond reading the blog post by Feldman and talking to other mom influencers. “I had to take her word for it,” Houston said.
For Armstrong, keeping companies in check is a positive use of her influence. “It’s like we have these tools; we have power against these companies who want to take advantage of us,” she said. Her rule is if she can’t resolve something through regular customer service channels, she can engage on social media.
Other influencers feel that endorsing or deflating a brand, regardless of how much interaction they have had with it, is their responsibility to their audience. It’s part of portraying their day-to-day lives authentically.
Kermilia White, a full-time influencer who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, has 75,000 followers across her social media platforms, including on Instagram, where she posts as themillennialsahm. She often writes about products meeting her expectations or disappointing her. (Her position is complicated by the fact that these brands often give her free products or sponsorships. She says her reviews represent her honest opinion, whether she gets the product free or not.)
“There was a startup company I worked with in January that had a stroller attachment,” she said. “I felt there was a good return on investment for that brand, so I made sure they could get some eyes on it as soon as they launched. I have a huge new-mom following.”
She added: “I always make it clear this is my experience. I say, ‘It won’t necessarily be the same for you, but for me, this is what happened.’ ”
Some influencers aim to be more journalistic. Liz Gumbinner’s website, Cool Mom Picks, gets millions of readers and hundreds of thousands of social followers. She also runs Cool Mom Tech, Cool Mom Eats and social media communities for mothers. Part of what the sites do is review products, especially startup brands owned by women and mothers.
Gumbinner has a team of writers, whom she pays, and she encourages them to do thorough research before posting a review.
“Our writers may try a new cosmetic product for a month, for example, before recommending it,” she said in an email. “With every product we write about, we need to earn our readers’ trust.”
Companies clearly like positive coverage. But when they are on the receiving end of negative chatter, they often feel at a disadvantage. Once a criticism goes viral, the damage is hard to undo.
Mom 2.0 and Dad 2.0, a conference for father content creators, hold training sessions that help participants communicate more effectively with brands and share their experiences with audiences. Keynote speakers and members of panels discuss the topic, and there are small-group workshops and round-table meetings.
At this year’s Mom 2.0 Summit session topics included “How to Connect and Work With Global Brands” and “Activism as an Influencer: How to Be the Driver of Change in Your Community.”
“I’ve seen somebody go after a hotel when they could have called the front desk to fix the problem,” said John Pacini, a co-founder of the conference. “We are trying to apply the same standards to our industry that work in normal face-to-face culture.”
Sometimes, Houston said, it is best to just back away from the internet. She recounted what she told to a friend, a new influencer popular with mothers, who asked Houston whether she should talk publicly about a bad experience at her neighborhood’s new coffee shop.
“I said: ‘No! They are brand-new. Why would you want to ruin them?’ ” Houston said. “It’s good she even asked us, though. A lot of people, that thought, to check, doesn’t even cross their mind.”

Resumen: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: Florida is fortunate to be home to 19 Fortune 500 companies - employers that are directly producing thousands of private-sector jobs, playing a strong role in Florida's vibrant economy, paying and collecting billions in taxes and contributing their time, talents and resources to many of Florida's philanthropic organizations who then put hundreds of millions of dollars to help those who can't help themselves.
Yet once again, these job creators are under attack. They are the "boogie man" for activist journalism which, far too often, seeks to advance socialism over free enterprise - apparently for more clicks, likes and retweets.
Only in America could the distorted tax policy theory of some become an Orlando Sentinel headline or fodder for a Sun Sentinel columnist. And situations like these are forcing job creators to become creative in their responses, just like FedEx Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith did recently when he tweeted his response to a New York Times front-page article on taxes.
As the late great Paul Harvey would say, "Now here's the rest of the story."
In uniting the business community for good, the Florida Chamber is shining a light on bogus, socialist-style reports that use half-truths and innuendoes in an attempt to somehow tarnish leading job creators (a system that has Florida creating one out of 13 new U.S. jobs).
Thanks to Florida job creators, Florida's unemployment level is lower than the national average. And families and businesses in high tax states like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois and California are fleeing their states for lower tax climates that allow families to save for a rainy day, businesses to hire more employees or reinvest in their facilities, and to create an overall better quality of life. These high-tax states apparently believe government creates jobs, when we all know that private sector employees create the jobs and the paychecks that are used to buy things that, in turn, create taxes that fund our government.
It's true that Florida has the fourth best tax climate in the country. That's because, unlike in high-tax states, Florida's corporate income tax reporting doesn't mandate "combined reporting." While that reporting style is favored by those who want to see Florida fail, it has not been roundly supported by economists. In fact, Florida's own economic forecasters have said combined reporting could decrease tax revenue, something Florida's education system, environment and transportation system can't afford.
That's not an economic forecast we're willing to stake Florida's future on.
Growing Florida's economy from 17th in the world to the 10th largest on the planet means ensuring global competitiveness, prosperity and high paying jobs, and vibrant and resilient communities. A competitive and equitable tax system that encourages job growth and strengthens our economy will be essential in achieving this goal.
That means the Florida Chamber will once again unite businesses in Florida's Capitol and fight for further reducing the corporate income tax, phasing out the business rent tax, leveling the online sales tax playing field, increasing the R&D tax credit to spur innovation, reducing the communications services tax and fixing Florida's lawsuit abuse tax.
With 4.5 million more people expected to call Florida home by 2030, we will continue to ensure Florida is a state where jobs provide Floridians an opportunity to prosper. And we will fight for free enterprise to lead the way.
For the last decade, lawmakers have been returning hard-earned tax dollars back to Floridians - through targeted tax savings like to back-to-school sales tax holidays and reductions in the corporate income tax. Yet, Florida's tax receipts continue to grow.
As Ronald Reagan used to say, if you want less of something, tax it. With all due respect to the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel, we're not willing to tax Florida's future away.
Mark Wilson is the President and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and can be reached at mwilson@flchamber.com.

Trump Had Been Told About Whistle-Blower Before Releasing Aid

Texto completo: White House lawyers briefed President Trump in late August about the complaint, people familiar with the matter said.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump had already been briefed on a whistle-blower's complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Lawyers from the White House counsel's office told Mr. Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the people said.
The revelation could shed light on Mr. Trump's thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $ 391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a "quid pro quo" with Kyiv. Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair.
Mr. Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistle-blower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to conduct investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump's re-election chances.
The complaint from the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who submitted it to the inspector general for the intelligence community in mid-August, put at the center of that pressure campaign a July 25 phone call between the presidents, which came at a time when Mr. Trump had already frozen the aid to the Ukrainian government. Mr. Trump asked that Mr. Zelensky "do us a favor," then brought up the investigations he sought, alarming White House aides who conveyed their concerns to the whistle-blower.
The White House declined to comment.
The whistle-blower complaint, which would typically be submitted to lawmakers who have oversight of the intelligence agencies, first came to light as the subject of an administration tug of war. In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, concluded that the administration needed to send it to Congress.
But the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, and his deputy John A. Eisenberg disagreed. They decided that the administration could withhold from Congress the whistle-blower's accusations because they were protected by executive privilege. The lawyers told Mr. Trump they planned to ask the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to determine whether they had to disclose the complaint to lawmakers.
A week later, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the administration did not have to hand over the complaint.
It is unclear how much detail the lawyers provided Mr. Trump about the complaint. The New York Times reported in September that White House advisers -- namely, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Eisenberg -- knew about the whistle-blower complaint in August. But the specifics of when and how Mr. Trump learned of it have not previously been reported.
The whistle-blower, whose identity has not been made public, accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by inviting a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. He described the pressure campaign to get Mr. Zelensky to publicly commit to investigations of Democrats that could potentially benefit Mr. Trump and suggested that a temporary hold that the administration had placed on assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting a war against Russian proxy forces, might be related to the effort.
New details also emerged on Tuesday about that decision to freeze the security assistance to Ukraine. An official from the White House budget office, Mark Sandy, testified that on July 12, he received an email from the office of the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, notifying him that Mr. Trump had directed that administration officials freeze Ukraine's military aid.
Mr. Trump had enthusiastically sought the investigations for much of the summer. But in early September, he told one of his top diplomats -- Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who helped carry out the shadow policy toward Ukraine -- that he was not seeking "a quid pro quo" with the Ukrainian government by withholding the aid.
Mr. Sondland said that when he called Mr. Trump to inquire about why the aid had been withheld, an irritated Mr. Trump insisted he was not seeking anything from the Ukrainians. But the president said that he wanted Mr. Zelensky "to do the right thing," Mr. Sondland testified to Congress last week, suggesting that he was still seeking the investigations into Democrats that could help his political fortunes.
There are discrepancies about whether Mr. Sondland spoke to the president on Sept. 7 or 9. The administration lifted the freeze on aid to Ukraine on Sept. 11, as lawmakers' demands grew. Two days earlier, three Democratic-led House committees had opened an investigation into Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Only days after the president learned of the whistle-blower complaint, he spoke with Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, about the aid holdup. Mr. Johnson sought permission to tell Mr. Zelensky at an upcoming meeting in Ukraine that Mr. Trump had decided to release the security assistance, according to Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Trump replied that he was not ready, Mr. Johnson said. He said he asked later on the call whether the aid was linked to some action that the president wanted the Ukrainians to take.
"Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed," Mr. Johnson wrote in a letter this month to House Republicans.
Mr. Trump erupted in anger and began cursing, he wrote.
"'No way,"' Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Johnson. "'I would never do that. Who told you that?"'
The White House has kept a tight hold on details about the actions of Mr. Trump and his senior aides in the Ukraine affair.
The president has refused to let top advisers testify in the impeachment inquiry, leaving a void that Republicans have exploited. They argue that the evidence that Democrats have gathered is insufficient because it contains few firsthand accounts linking the president to wrongdoing.
But Democrats have not only the transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call but also the testimony of Mr. Sondland, who said Mr. Trump directed him and other top administration officials to maintain pressure on Ukraine.
Both Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Eisenberg, who briefed Mr. Trump in late August about the whistle-blower complaint, had been following up on other complaints by administration officials about the Ukraine matter since early July.
Mr. Cipollone had suggested to Mr. Eisenberg in July that he tell Mr. Trump that White House staff members had raised concerns about a shadow Ukraine policy. Mr. Eisenberg, who does not typically brief Mr. Trump, never followed up on the suggestion.

Texto completo: The streaming site's long-term lease will keep the lights on at the once-shuttered, 71-year-old movie house.
When the Paris Theater, New York City's last surviving single-screen movie house, shut its doors in August, it wasn't just a heart-wrenching loss for film lovers: It was a physical symbol of the ways streaming services are fundamentally changing the film industry.
Now, a streaming platform is coming to its rescue.
Netflix, whose theatrical run of Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story" reopened the Paris earlier this month, on Monday announced its agreement to lease the space.
The long-term deal gives the company a New York venue for screenings, premieres and special events as the platform continues to expand beyond laptops and into theaters.
Netflix will lease the space from the New York real estate developer Sheldon Solow, who still owns the theater. The company, which will continue to screen its films in other New York theaters, did not disclose the specifics of the deal.
For 71 years, the Paris was a lush haven for fans of prestige films. The art-house experience filled a niche for cinema aficionados that can be harder to find among the bigger movie theater chains -- perhaps a draw for Netflix, which hasn't had much luck with chains as of late.
Theatrical releases -- a requirement for Oscar eligibility -- are still a recent venture for the company. One of the first was Alfonso Cuarón's "Roma," a big Oscar winner for Netflix that ran in theaters in the United States for three weeks before streaming online.
And "The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's gangster epic, is still being shown on Broadway at the Belasco Theater ahead of its streaming release Wednesday.
With the new lease, the "Marriage Story" run at the Paris is getting a two-week extension, with no set end date. The film is to start streaming on Dec. 6.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kyiv before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.
The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Mr. Trump has dismissed as a hoax.
The inquiry alleges that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by pressing Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically at a time when he had ordered congressionally approved Ukraine aid put on hold . The White House has defended the president's actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president's request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.
The August briefing Mr. Trump received from the White House lawyers, which was earlier reported by the New York Times, indicates Mr. Trump was aware of the whistleblower complaint before he ordered the hold on aid lifted.
A White House spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
Messrs. Cipollone and Eisenberg had known in early July about concerns from White House officials about Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine but didn't relay those concerns to the president, The Wall Street Journal has reported .
Mr. Trump said at an Oct. 2 news conference that he lifted the aid after a request from Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio).
The whistleblower complaint followed a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Mr. Trump asked his counterpart to work with Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump, including into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful. Mr. Trump has termed the call "perfect."
Several former and current administration officials have testified that they understood the Trump administration wouldn't release the aid until Ukraine announced it was opening the investigations. Ukraine made no such announcement.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly posted quotes on social media from allies , including from Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), defending the president's actions by pointing out that the hold on Ukraine aid was lifted without Kyiv opening any investigations.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said in an Oct. 20 interview on Fox News that there was no quid pro quo in Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine "and I can prove it to you: the aid flowed."

David Holmes: From Claremont Colleges to impeachment hearings

Texto completo: There’s a local angle to everything, even the impeachment hearings. David Holmes, a U.S. Embassy diplomat in Ukraine who testified Nov. 21, went to college in the Inland Valley, as reader Ray Escoto alerted me.
“I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California,” Holmes told the House Intelligence Committee in his opening statement. No one interrupted to ask why Pomona College isn’t in Pomona.
Holmes is the witness who said he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador, when Sondland placed a call to President Donald Trump on an unsecured line. Trump spoke so loudly, Holmes said, that Sondland pulled the phone away from his ear and both sides of the conversation were audible.
(We’ve all taken calls like that. Perhaps I’ll get one after this item runs.)
According to Holmes, when Trump asked if the Ukrainian president was on board with investigating the Bidens, Sondland assured the president, “He loves your ass.”
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,” Holmes testified.
In response, Trump tweeted that his hearing is “great” and that he’s never been able to overhear the other side of a phone conversation, statements that may cancel each other out.
“Who is David Holmes?,” the New York Times asked in a headline the next day. Answering its own question, the paper said Holmes joined the State Department under President George W. Bush and has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan and India.
He won a State Department award in 2014 for “constructive dissent” for expressing concerns about President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan. The Washington Post described him as “a rising star in the Foreign Service.”
Closer to home, the 1997 alumnus won Pomona College’s Inspirational Young Alumni Award in 2004. Still, be careful what you say around him. He must have good ears.
Grandfatherly advice
A newspaper colleague in Upland told me last week: “My grandson had to attend a council meeting for his government class so I suggested he go to Ontario, rather than Upland meetings which go on forever. Great idea — tonight’s Ontario meeting lasted 12 minutes.”
I’ve rarely seen any high school students at Ontario meetings, but they’re worth the drive if you want to spare yourself a late night. And also if your grade isn’t dependent on excitement.
Stone wall (cont’d)
Remember the topic of the stone wall on Claremont’s Foothill Boulevard, newly revealed after vegetation was removed? Its origins are somewhat mysterious, although it’s believed to date to the 1920s or ’30s, when the land behind it was first subdivided for housing.
But now we know who built it: Clarence Stover.
Paula Pitzer, into whose family Stover married, told me: “His idea was he would make a form and drop in cement, rebar and these rocks. After he got in enough layers, he would shake the form. The idea is the rocks would slide over the surfaces and it would make it a good look.”
Stover’s company built houses, college buildings and commercial buildings in the Village. Stover “contributed to the look of Claremont more than any other builder,” John Neiuber wrote in the Courier in 2018.
Stover graduated from Pomona College in 1921, later served as a trustee and has the campus’ Stover Memorial Walk near Bridges Auditorium named for him. He died in 1955.
“He never did another wall,” Pitzer said. Apparently building it was more labor-intensive than he’d expected. But the one wall he did certainly contributed to the look of Claremont.
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving almost couldn’t fall any later, but here it comes Nov. 28 — not even a month shy of Christmas.
Whenever the date lands, it’s an opportunity to reflect on what we’re thankful for. Reasons I’m thankful include a stimulating job in an ever-changing valley, one that generates a steady flow of column ideas. Another reason is you attentive readers, who let me know you’re reading, correct me when I flub something and give me the occasional knock to keep me honest.
Thanks for reading, enjoy your holiday and I’ll see you here Friday — with a column I’ll be cobbling together on Wednesday, pre-turkey.
Valley Vignette
The TGI Friday’s restaurant in Ontario at 3351 N. Centre Lake Drive is closing Dec. 8. Reader Jeff Butler told me he and his wife have been regulars for 15 years and got the bad news from the manager recently. “There are a lot of memories from that place, as we had many birthday dinners and dinners with good friends there,” Butler said. The restaurant is planning a “Go out with a bang” farewell party Dec. 5 from 6 to 10 p.m. for regulars. “So come early,” an announcement board in the restaurant urges, “and let’s talk about how we all made this place like home.”

Ponte Vedra resident published numerous bestsellers

Texto completo: Walter Minton: 1923-2019

Walter J. Minton, a risk-taking publisher who goaded censors and put out a slew of bestsellers during his 23-year run at the helm of G.P. Putnam's Sons, releasing Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita," Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" and works by authors including Norman Mailer and John le CarrÃ©, died Nov. 19 at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach.

His wife, Marion Minton, confirmed the death but did not give a precise cause.

Mr. Minton was 31 when he became president of Putnam's in 1955, succeeding his father as head of the company. He once planned to pursue a legal career and found himself immersed -- not altogether unhappily -- in a world of legal threats and occasional obscenity trials, while publishing many of his era's most acclaimed and controversial writers.

Through Putnam's and its imprints (including Berkley Books and Coward, McCann & Geoghegan), Mr. Minton published authors including Simone de Beauvoir, Scott Turow, Philip K. Dick, Thomas Harris and Robert A. Heinlein, whose science-fiction novel "Stranger in a Strange Land" (1961) was a personal favorite.

His publishing house was the first to release U.S. editions of novels including William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," in 1955, and le CarrÃ©'s "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold," in 1964. It also

published a pair of major 1973 nonfiction books: "Plain Speaking," an "oral biography" of President Harry S. Truman by Merle Miller, and "An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park," by Elliott Roosevelt and James Brough.

But Mr. Minton was perhaps best known for taking a chance on novels that, because of their sexual content, no other publisher would touch. The year he became Putnam's president, his firm published Mailer's "The Deer Park," which included a passage involving oral sex. Mr. Minton told the New Yorker last year that he had admired Mailer's 1948 debut, "The Naked and the Dead," and pursued the author's new novel after receiving a call from Bennett Cerf, a co-founder of Random House.

"Cerf said, ‘Walter, I know you're young, but if you publish this book, you'll bring down the great veil of censorship,' " Mr. Minton recalled. "We published it and ran ads: ‘The Book Six Publishers Refused to Bring You!' "

Mr. Minton acquired the novel without making any changes, later telling Mailer that he had been prepared to take the book without reading it, fully confident that its sales would more than make up for the author's advance. "He is the only publisher I ever met who would make a good general," Mailer wrote.

In 1958, Mr. Minton took an even bigger gamble in publishing the first U.S. edition of "Lolita," Nabokov's novel about a literature professor's obsession with a 12-year-old girl. Although it is now considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, the book had been spurned by editors -- one recommended "that it be buried under a stone for a thousand years" -- and faced bans in Europe after being published by Olympia Press, a small Paris-based firm run by Maurice Girodias.

Mr. Minton told the New Yorker that he first came across "Lolita" after falling asleep in the living room of Rosemary Ridgewell, a former showgirl: "I woke in the middle of the night and there was this story on the table. I started reading. By morning, I knew I had to publish it."

"It had a reputation of being very sexy, though it really wasn't," he added, "and a lot of publishers who wouldn't bring it to you, because it was too ‘dirty.' To me, that was an opportunity." So he wrote an introductory letter to Nabokov: "Being a rather backward example of that rather backward species, the American publisher, it was only recently that I began to hear about a book called ‘Lolita.' . . . I am wondering if the book is available for publication."

Mr. Minton cut a deal with Girodias and released the novel to a flurry of negative reviews but no major lawsuits. Nabokov's agent announced that "Lolita" was the first book since "Gone With the Wind" to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks; years later, according to the New Yorker, the author would refer to Mr. Minton's home in Saddle River, N.J., as "the house ‘Lolita' built."

Over the next few years, Mr. Minton presided over American editions of "Candy," a 1958 sex satire by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, and "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," an 18th-century erotic novel by John Cleland.

Popularly known as "Fanny Hill," the latter chronicled a country girl who becomes a London prostitute, and was banned for obscenity in Massachusetts after its release in 1963. The ban was overturned three years later in a landmark Supreme Court decision, Memoirs v. Massachusetts, in which Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote that even a "modicum of social value" was enough to protect a book under the First Amendment, regardless of how prurient or "patently offensive" it might be.

The legal saga proved gratifying and lucrative for Mr. Minton. "We've sold 10 times as many copies as we would have," he told the New York Times, "if there hadn't been this censorship proceeding."

Walter Joseph Minton was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1923. His mother, the former Ida Harris, was once a chorus line dancer; his father, Melville, entered the publishing business at 15, partly as a result of a transit mishap.

According to family lore, Melville had been offered a job at Standard Oil's headquarters in Lower Manhattan, but took the wrong ferry from New Jersey and found himself in Midtown, near Charles Scribner's Sons. A family friend there helped him to a job in the sales department, and in 1924 he co-founded his own firm, Minton, Balch & Co., which merged with Putnam's six years later.

Melville Minton was made president in 1932, and by the time his son was 11 he had already mapped out a career plan for him: six months in the stock and shipping room, followed by a couple years in manufacturing, three or four more in sales, a stint in advertising, several months in accounting and finally a stay in the editorial division.

After graduating from the Lawrenceville preparatory school in New Jersey, Walter Minton studied at Williams College in Massachusetts and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1947. (His education was interrupted for several years by Army service, with Mr. Minton working as an X-ray technician at a prisoner-of-war camp in Belle Mead, N.J.)

e was enrolled at Harvard Law when his father said, ‘Just come work this summer,' " Marion Minton recalled. "And of course he never left," with jobs in sales, advertising and publicity before rising to become president.

Mr. Minton sold Putnam's to the entertainment conglomerate MCA in 1975, at a time when independent publishing houses were being swept up by larger companies. He was replaced as president three years later by Peter Israel, an editor and novelist, and finally made his way to law school, graduating from Columbia in 1982 at the age of 58.

He worked for several years at a firm in New Jersey before retiring to Florida, and his former company is now part of Penguin Random House. He was a Ponte Vedra Beach resident for 30 years.

Mr. Minton's first marriage, to Pauline Ehst, ended in divorce. In 1970, he married Marion Whitehorn. In addition to his wife, survivors include three children from his first marriage; three children from his second; 17 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

One of Putnam's biggest successes under Mr. Minton emerged out of a contest he launched in the early 1960s to find "the best unpublished novel in the English language," according to a blog post by Israel, his successor at the company.

Mr. Minton offered a six-figure advance, with predictable results. "Every fiction manuscript on every dusty shelf in the English-speaking world," Israel wrote, "ended up in the floor-to-ceiling piles that adorned our corridors and offices."

The contest ended without a winner. But among the novels signed during the hunt, using "seed money" given out to promising writers, was a pulpy Mafia epic titled "The Godfather." Dismissed by some critics as a "trash novel," it sold more than 20 million copies and inspired Francis Ford Coppola's Oscar-winning film trilogy.

Texto completo: Bloomberg News
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is preparing to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Florida for his 2020 campaign after changes in demographics and voting laws put the linchpin swing state up for grabs.
Democrats have made potentially major inroads since Trump won the state handily in 2016. They pushed through an amendment to the state’s constitution restoring the right to vote for more than 1 million convicted felons. And as many as 40,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Florida after Hurricane Maria — a disaster that all but shattered Trump’s standing with the island’s residents because of the botched government response.
But if Democrats want to flip Florida’s 29 electoral votes to their column in 2020, Trump and the Republican Party plan to make them pay dearly. His campaign intends to spend more than $200 million in Florida alone, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump’s campaign manager moved there, and the president even changed his permanent residence to Palm Beach.
“The Trump campaign says they need Florida, no ifs, ands or buts,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP fundraiser active in the state’s politics. “They think without Florida there’s no path.”
Trump officially kicked off his re-election campaign with a rally in Orlando in June, and he’ll hold another one on Tuesday in Sunrise, Fla. — not far from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, his new home address, where he’ll spend the Thanksgiving holiday.
Trump won Florida in 2016 by about 1.2 percentage points, and Republicans retained the governor’s mansion in 2018 despite voter backlash against Trump elsewhere in the country that put the U.S. House under Democratic control. Smarting from the losses, Florida Democrats say they’ve autopsied their missteps and won’t repeat them.
Trump intends to devote a huge percentage of his war chest to the state. In his first run for the White House in 2008, Barack Obama’s campaign raised $779 million, still the largest amount for any presidential committee. If Trump manages to raise $1 billion, he’d still be devoting one of every five dollars to winning Florida.
“The president and the president’s campaign understand” Florida’s importance, Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Republican Ron DeSantis, said in an interview. “Hell, it’s now why the president has changed his ZIP code and is now domiciled in the state.”
An October New York Times/Siena College poll of 3,766 registered voters showed Trump trailing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Florida by 2 points in a hypothetical 2020 matchup. He held a 1-point lead on Senator Bernie Sanders and a 4-point advantage over Senator Elizabeth Warren, both of whom are challenging Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.
But since the poll was conducted, Trump has faced withering scrutiny as the U.S. House conducted two weeks of impeachment hearings featuring a parade of current and former members of the administration laying out in detail the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that could help him politically.
If Trump loses Florida, he’d have to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three Rust Belt states he narrowly won in 2016, along with the rest of the red and swing states he carried that year.
Gillum, formerly the mayor of Tallahassee, now volunteers as the chair of Forward Florida Action, a voter registration organization. He said Democrats are focusing on registering new voters, educating them and energizing them to show up to the polls “much further out from election day” than in the past.
A particular focus is Latinos as well as convicted felons now eligible to vote. “I think we change the arithmetic,” Gillum said.
Of the approximately 1.4 million convicted felons who can now vote, Democrats have used publicly available data to identify about 800,000 that are likely to vote in the next election, regardless of their party affiliation, says Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.
In June, DeSantis signed Republican-written legislation that would require felons to first pay off overdue criminal fines before they can vote. But in October, a U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the measure from being enforced. DeSantis filed an appeal on Nov. 15.
In addition, between 20,000 and 40,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Florida following Maria, according to an analysis based on flight data by Stefan Rayer, population program director at the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research department. According to 2018 census data, Florida has more than 1.1 million citizens that identify as Puerto Rican — up 11% from 2016.
The Trump campaign is responding to the demographic threat with cash.
America First, the primary Super-PAC working on Trump’s re-election, has a goal to raise $300 million nationally for the 2020 campaign. It plans to spend a significant amount of that money in Florida, said Kelly Sadler, the group’s spokeswoman.
America First also already has staffers in Florida registering voters, she said. It recently concluded focus groups with Hispanic men in Orlando and Miami, testing strategies that seek to tie Democrats to socialism and struggling Latin American autocracies such as Venezuela and Cuba, she said.
Florida is an expensive state to campaign in because it has so many media markets, according to Advertising Analytics, which studies political commercials. Miami, which skews heavily Democratic, has the highest prices. Orlando and Tampa, which are more competitive, see most of the spending and are also expensive. There are four TV markets in the conservative Panhandle region that are individually cheaper than other parts of the state but collectively expensive if a campaign wants to run ads in all of them.
The state saw the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history in 2018 when Republican Rick Scott, previously the governor, defeated incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. The candidates, their parties and outside groups combined to spend $213 million, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.
“It’s his home state, now,” Rick Gorka, deputy communications director for the Republican National Committee, said in an interview. “There’s a lot of reasons to make sure Florida stays red.”
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
Trump has been joined as a Florida resident by Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, who relocated from San Antonio earlier this year.
Trump’s campaign and the RNC together have raised $308 million through the end of the third quarter, $110 million more than President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party had raised at the same point in 2011. Obama’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee eventually spent $1 billion to secure his re-election, a figure Trump is likely to comfortably eclipse.
Gorka declined to comment on how much Trump’s campaign plans to spend in Florida. Republicans will blanket Florida with TV and digital ads and on-the-ground outreach to voters, aiming to compete in every part of the state, he said.

Texto completo: She championed Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe and helped shape public opinion about the 20th century's foremost avant-garde artists.
Dorothy Seiberling, an influential magazine editor who championed modern artists, died on Saturday in Wilmington, Del. She was 97.
Her death was confirmed by her niece Mary Huhn.
As Life magazine's art editor, Ms. Seiberling helped shape public opinion about the 20th century's foremost avant-gardist artists, encouraging open-minded consideration of their importance.
Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe were already renowned by the time she produced feature articles on them, but their legacies were in question. Some art critics had written off Pollock's Abstract Expressionist work, particularly his celebrated "drip paintings," as chaotic and unintentional, and O'Keeffe's as explicitly feminine -- "a woman on paper," as her husband, the photographer and gallerist Alfred Stieglitz, said. (She didn't see it that way.)
Ms. Seiberling's articles and interviews instead posed questions and illuminated their painting processes in vivid photo essays. Rather than defaulting to statements about gender, Ms. Seiberling referred to O'Keeffe, who granted her a rare interview at her studio in Abiquiu, N.M., as "one of the most distinguished pioneers of modern American art."
With her first husband, Leo Steinberg, regarded as one of the most important art critics of the 20th century, Ms. Seiberling amassed countless art prints, a handful of which the couple donated to the University of Iowa Museum of Art.
Decades later, Ms. Seiberling gave dozens of pieces from her personal collection -- including works by Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, Christo and Claes Oldenburg -- to the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College. Papers from her editorship at Life are in the archives of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
Dorothy Seiberling was born on March 7, 1922, in Akron, Ohio. Her mother, Henrietta Buckler Seiberling, helped found Alcoholics Anonymous; the first meeting reportedly took place when she invited two men into her home to talk. Her father, J. Frederick Seiberling, was the son of Frank Seiberling, a founder of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Seiberling Rubber Company, for which he worked.
Dorothy was the youngest of three children. Her brother, John F. Seiberling, was a congressman from Ohio who sat on the House Judiciary Committee during President Richard M. Nixon's impeachment hearings in 1974; her sister, Mary, was a social justice activist. They grew up at Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens, their grandfather's 70-acre estate in Akron.
Ms. Seiberling attended Vassar, where her mother and sister also studied, and graduated in 1943 as an English major. In the 1960s, when the presidents of Yale and Vassar were considering a merger of the two schools, Ms. Seiberling joined a resistance movement to keep the institutions separate; she published an essay in Life urging their autonomy.
"A Vassar in New Haven would have as much relation to the original as Athens, Ohio, to Athens, Greece," she wrote.
After graduation, Ms. Seiberling was accepted into a training program for researchers and fact checkers at Time Inc. She rotated among departments before landing at Life as a researcher. Within a decade she had worked her way up to editing and writing for the magazine.
Her articles sought to make Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline accessible to a somewhat perplexed public. She was especially proud of a special double issue, "The Bible," published during the Christmas season of 1964, examining the book's influence on history.
She married Mr. Steinberg in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce, and he died in 2011. They had no children. Ms. Seiberling is survived by seven nieces and nephews, who knew her as Aunt Babe.
Ms. Seiberling became Life's senior art editor in 1965. When the magazine ceased weekly publication in 1972, she was out of a job.
She was hired by Clay Felker, who had left Life a few years earlier to establish New York magazine. After a few years, she joined The New York Times Magazine, where she was appointed deputy editor.
In 1977, Ms. Seiberling reconnected with a friend, Sidney Stiber, whose job titles included director, producer, restaurateur and aviator; they soon married.
Not long after, Ms. Seiberling quit her magazine job and moved to Shelter Island, N.Y., where she became involved with the Shelter Island Friends of Music, a nonprofit group dedicated to bringing classical music to Long Island's East End. She was its president for 22 years.
Mr. Stiber died in 2013. That year, Ms. Seiberling sold her apartment at the Beresford, on Central Park West, for a reported $ 3.8 million.
Until October, Ms. Seiberling lived on Shelter Island, where she remained committed to bringing art to the public, even after stepping down as the Friends of Music president.
"She's already preparing copy for the next SIFM concert," a 2012 article in The Shelter Island Reporter said, after announcing her retirement.

Texto completo: Readers are disturbed by the president's intervention in war crimes cases.
To the Editor:
Re "Naval Secretary Is Told to Resign by Defense Chief" (front page, Nov. 25):
Imagine that an authoritarian president in a country in Eastern Europe, Africa or South America pardons military operatives accused of murderous war crimes. What would be your reaction?
President Trump's norm-breaking interference in the military chain of command hits a new level of dangerousness. For if military discipline can be overthrown at the whim of the commander in chief, it is no longer subject to the rule of law.
We're on the cusp of a situation in which the president could directly order a war crime, foreign or domestic, and then pardon the perpetrators. This would be true tyranny.
Eric W. Orts

The writer is a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
To the Editor:
I'm a Marine who was on active duty from 1966 to 1968. To me the worst thing President Trump has done, worse than his constant lying, lawbreaking and advocacy of cruelty and exclusion, is intervening on behalf of a Navy SEAL convicted of exulting over a dead prisoner whom he may have killed. Our military, like most in the West, has committed war crimes, but hitherto it has tried to own up to it, to try servicemen and women accused of war crimes and punish those convicted, as it did those who waterboarded Filipinos during the Philippine-American War early in the 20th century and those who massacred civilians in Vietnam.
Now the man in overall command of the forces helps a convicted war criminal, saves his rank and has the secretary of the Navy fired for defending our Uniform Code of Military Justice. To me that's inexcusable.

To the Editor:
Re "The Moral Injury of Pardoning War Crimes" (editorial, Nov. 24):
The obvious way to avoid war-induced moral injury is not to engage in immoral wars in the first place, nor to glorify militarism run amok. But go to war we do, and President Trump is not the first to excuse inexcusable killing. The moral injury that results, however, is not so much a bruise on the soul, as a scar on the soul, which doesn't go away. Nor should it.
Painful as it is, soldiers need to come to terms with their actions, as do the nations that send them to war, and more than treatment, what's required is atonement.
In researching soldiers who came to oppose war, I've talked with scores of veterans of wars from Vietnam to the present, most of whom have some form of a moral injury. They atone by working to end wars.
Though I have no idea about the state of the souls of the veterans in Congress, if they too feel a moral injury, cutting the bloated military budget and putting a stop to our endless rounds of war would be good places to start atoning.

Texto completo: The national media are working in concert to deny that Ukraine's government tried to take President Trump down in the 2016 election.
A lot of journalists are — without evidence! — asserting that Ukraine's interference has been "debunked," as if Politico and the New York Times were reporting conspiracy theories when they exposed, in very clear terms, Ukraine's election meddling in the first place.
In truth, it hasn't been "debunked" at all, but they figure if they repeat over and over again that Ukraine's meddling is a "conspiracy theory" that's been completely "dismantled," people will just have to accept that as what it is.
CNN, on Monday, ran a graphic on-screen blaring, "Republicans push debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory." New York Times columnist Charles Blow, on Sunday, referred to "the debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 election."
ABC News: "Trump continues to push debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory."
MSNBC: "Trump continues pushing debunked Ukraine conspiracy theories."
Associated Press: "Debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory is knocked down - again."
The "debunked" crew got a special boost during last week's impeachment hearings when former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified that Ukraine's interference was nothing more than a "fictional narrative" that originated with — where else? — Russia.
CNN was beside itself, reporting that Hill's testimony "deflated right-wing conspiracy theories that Ukraine, and not necessarily Russia, meddled in the 2016 election." CNN lauded Hill for having "[taken] apart the idea that Ukraine was responsible for the real election meddling in 2016."
No, she didn't. She may have doubted that Ukraine interfered. She may have rebutted the idea of Ukrainian interference. She may have disputed it. She may also be correct that Russian interference was much more extensive. But nothing was "taken apart" or debunked.
Hill said she believed that Russia interfered in our election, and seemed to imply (although it wasn't completely clear) that Ukraine had not. Okay, that's a fine opinion to have, but it ignores all of the evidence that Ukraine did also interfere.
To contradict something isn't the same as to "debunk" it. If that were the case, Trump would have "debunked" the media's insistence that there was no emergency at the border, Brett Kavanaugh would have "debunked" Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he tried to rape her, and I would have "debunked" the theory that Charles Blow knows how to write.
Ukraine did interfere in the 2016 election. Journalists are free to deny it, and so are career government bureaucrats. That doesn't change the facts.

Juez propina fuerte golpe a Trump que afectará al proceso de juicio político contra el presidente

Texto completo: Los demócratas ganaron este lunes una batalla legal contra la negativa de Donald Trump a dejar participar a sus principales asesores en las audiencias para su juicio político. Un juez falló que el antiguo asesor del presidente Donald F. McGahn II deberá declarar ante los investigadores del ‘impeachment’ sobre si Trump obstruyó la investigación Mueller .
El juez Ketanji Brown Jackson, del Tribunal de Distrito Federal para el Distrito de Columbia, rechazó el bloqueo de la administración Trump al proceso de juicio político contra el presidente . El gobierno había afirmado que los principales asesores de Trump estaban exentos de hablar sobre sus deberes oficiales y que, por tanto, ni siquiera acudirían a una citación.
Sin embargo, esto no garantiza que McGahn testifique pronto ya que lo más seguro es que el Departamento de Justicia presentará una apelación para que se suspenda el fallo del juez. El afectado y su abogado, William A. Burck, defienden que la batalla se libra entre el Congreso y la administración Trump para que los abogados del gobierno sean los que manejen el caso.
“Don McGahn acatará la decisión del juez Jackson a menos que se suspenda mientras se espera apelación”, dijo Burck a The New York Times por correo electrónico. “El Departamento de Justicia está manejando este caso, por lo que deberá preguntarles si tienen la intención de solicitar una suspensión”, añadió.
Aunque el Departamento de Justicia pida la suspensión para hacer apelaciones, el fallo también alcanza a la inmunidad que la Casa Blanca ha invocado sobre otros testigos para no colaborar con la investigación de los demócratas en el Congreso . Varios de ellos ya se han acogido a la teoría de la administración para negarse a declarar por el escándalo ucraniano.
Si McGahn se niega a testificar hasta que el caso llegue a la Corte Suprema y esta emita un fallo, es posible que el asunto no se resuelva a tiempo para que la declaración del exasesor del presidente tenga un peso importante en la investigación.

Crowdfunding can’t solve this dilemma

Texto completo: When Citrus County commissioners signaled their opposition to a digital subscription to the New York Times for local library cardholders, some outraged readers responded with their wallets.

Multiple online fundraisers sprung up to foot the $2,700 bill for digital access to the Times. At least 15 GoFundMe pages were active Thursday, having raised more than $7,000.

One problem: The Citrus library system says it cannot use the money after the commissioners, in a 3-2 vote Tuesday, rejected signing onto the digital subscription for the countys 70,000 library cardholders.

The money has to go back to the people that donated it, said Sandy Price, the chair of both the local Friends of the Library and the Library Advisory Board.

By Friday morning, most of the GoFundMe pages had been taken down.

I can confirm that in light of the commissioners recent vote,

we have refunded all donors who gave to campaigns related to the Citrus County Libraries, a GoFundMe spokeswoman wrote in an email. Its important to know that the platform is backed by the GoFundMe Guarantee, which means funds are guaranteed to go to the right place or donors will get a refund.

Citrus Library Director Eric Head, speaking through a county spokeswoman amid the brouhaha, explained simply that officials cannot pay for what they do not have. County spokeswoman Cynthia Oswald said the digital subscription would have required a contract agreement, which in Citrus needs to be approved by the commission and signed by the commission chair.

Library leaders said they are stuck, even if the private money is there now to cover the cost.

Price said she has not personally spoken to any of the various online fundraising organizers, who had listed hometowns all around the country, from Massachusetts to Texas. If its money thats given for the specific digital subscription, we cannot take that, she said.

A few people early during the controversy made checks out directly to the libraries, Head said, for an amount under $200. They will be contacted to see if they would like their donation to be just a general donation or returned, he wrote in an email.

The debate was ignited when Commissioner Scott Carnahan spoke out against the subscription at a meeting Oct. 24, saying, Fake news, I agree with President Trump.

Those words resounded far beyond Citrus, a conservative county in West Central Florida known as a destination for its natural springs and manatees.

Dozens of people showed up at the meeting Tuesday before the board voted. Commissioner Jimmie Smith said he would support private funds paying for the subscription, but others said the county had no policy for such a funding model.

Several opponents said they would like to see the county use $2,700 elsewhere, to feed the hungry or house homeless veterans. But Price said those people misunderstood.

You cant take money out of the library budget and give it to some other faction of the county, she said.

Whats next?

Were going to regroup, and were going to go forward because our library needs to get in the digital age, Price said. She doesnt know yet how the libraries will gain commissioners approval. She has not spoken to them.

The two commissioners who voted in favor of the subscription wanted the digital access to replace the countys current print plan, which costs $2,900. Citrus libraries receive hard copies of several newspapers, including the Citrus County Chronicle, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today.

Price said the Friends of the Library is a fundraising group that each year makes about $60,000 through two book sales to help the libraries. That money goes toward expanding the collection and renovating parts of the branch buildings.

The Friends will still accept donations, she said, but not any earmarked for the Times subscription.

Kevin Leahy, from Cincinnati, Ohio, ran one GoFundMe page that took in about $2,100 before being shut down. He said his mother was a librarian.

I dont know their legal constraints, and I want to be respectful of that, he said of Citrus. But on the face of it, it feels like an absurd position.

Another fundraiser, Kevin Gallagher of Boston, updated the more than 150 donors to his page, which had raised $3,400, about the commissions vote.

Im not comfortable changing this campaigns mission when those who have contributed, contributed to a specific cause, he wrote. However, one suggestion has stood out: change the mission to donate these funds to those running against the county commissioners. Seems like a great cause, the root of the problem. Thoughts?

By Friday, he switched course.

Ive decided to just have GoFundMe refund everyone, he wrote. Changing the focus is way too much for me to do and the suggestions of what else can be done is overwhelming. So thanks again, its very unfortunate this didnt work out the way we wanted.

Texto completo: Australia The governing body for the country’s soccer will close the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams. The Football Federation Australia reached an agreement Nov. 5 to assure equal resources for the two teams. However, FIFA World Cup payouts are still vastly unequal. The prize money for the 2019 Women’s World Cup was $30 million, while the men’s payout for the year before was $400 million. The Australian women’s team is ranked eighth in the world by FIFA. The men’s team is ranked 44th. The announcement comes as the U.S. women’s national team, which won the Women’s World Cup in France this year, is involved in litigation seeking parity in pay and resources with the U.S. men’s national team. The case is scheduled to go to trial in May. (The New York Times) 
South Africa The rooibos tea industry will pay indigenous people 1.5% of the value that farmers get when they sell the tea to processors.  This could amount to more than half a million dollars a year. The transactions recognize that the indigenous Khoisan people were the first to cultivate the product. South Africa’s oldest inhabitants, the Khoisan are made up of several communities: the Cape Khoi, the Nama, the Koranna, the Griqua, and the San – who also refer to themselves as bushmen. Rooibos only grows in the Suid Bokkeveld region of the country, where the Khoisan have used the tea for centuries. (BBC)
Uganda and Congo The two countries reached an agreement to work on key road networks, which will connect the nations and foster trade. Announced at a meeting between the nations in early November, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi agreed to build a road network that will cover more than 730 miles. One road will go from Goli, Uganda, to Mahagi and Bunia in Congo. Violent militias, one of which has been linked to the Islamic State, have troubled the region. The infrastructure project, according to Mr. Museveni, should improve the region’s security. (MedAfricaTimes, The Defense Post)
Lewiston, Maine Safiya Khalid was elected to the Lewiston City Council in Maine in November. Ms. Khalid, who lived in a Somali refugee camp as a child before coming to the United States, won the seat with 70% of the vote. The Monitor’s Oct. 28 cover story, “How refugees transformed a town,” detailed the story of Lewiston, which became home to 6,000 African refugees and asylum-seekers. Ms. Khalid, who persisted with her campaign despite harassment, has secured a spot at the table to represent her community, said Lewiston Mayor Kristen Cloutier. In January, Ms. Khalid will become the council’s youngest member. She wants to champion public schools. “When I came here, I didn’t know how to write my name or speak any word of English,” said Ms. Khalid. “I am who I am because of public education.” (The Associated Press)
Bangladesh About 192,000 Rohingya children are being educated by UNICEF and its partners in 2,167 learning centers spread across the country. When more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees fled to Bangladesh from persecution in Myanmar in 2017, thousands of Rohingya children were cut off from schooling. While 25,000 children are still not attending any educational program, UNICEF estimates 89% of Rohingya children under age 14 now have access to learning from the centers. But 640 learning centers are still needed, UNICEF says. Rohingya educators are hoping to have more of their history integrated into the curriculum. (The New Humanitarian, UNICEF)

Texto completo: One of the year's best films, the searing family drama "Waves," comes from a director living in Orlando. Rolling Stone dubs Trey Edward Shults "one major young filmmaker."
Shults, 31, is also writer, co-editor, a producer and a music editor on "Waves," which opens Wednesday at Enzian Theater in Maitland.
Rich in color, sound and swirling camera movements, "Waves" limits the dialogue as it follows teen siblings Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Emily (Taylor Russell in a breakout performance).
"Hopefully it feels immersive, that you're living it with the characters' perspective, with Tyler and then Emily," Shults said in an interview. "If I can tell a story visually and put that over dialogue, I get really excited."
Reviewers are excited by Shults. Michael Phillips, of the Chicago Tribune, said "Waves" is "both unpredictable and powerful in its impact." Manohla Dargis in The New York Times writes: "'Waves' is the story of a Florida family nearly undone by a shocking tragedy. It's also a spectacular testament to the talents of the writer-director Trey Edward Shults, making just his third feature-length movie."
Shults' earlier "Krisha" (2015) and "It Comes at Night" (2017) dealt with family. He met Harrison on the latter film and wrote Tyler for him. The role, Shults said, fuses his own experiences with those of Harrison. Shults, raised by his mother and stepfather, reunited with his biological father shortly before the man died in 2013.
In "Waves," Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown ("This Is Us") plays the teens' stern father, and Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry ("Hamilton") portrays their concerned stepmother.
"I'm a lucky man," Shults says of his cast. "We built it together to where at the end it felt like a beautiful, collaborative family."
When the film pauses for dialogue, the results can be shattering. Phillips called attention to a scene between the father and Emily, saying it's "just about perfect."
"To me, that's the heartbeat scene of the film, and the whole film is leading to that scene," Shults said. "We just got out of the way, and just wanted to let the actors act. You're dealing with two amazing actors."
The focus on family sets "Waves" apart from many year-end movies. "Family is very important for me, man, trying to explore the good and bad of family and the gray and everything in between because we're complex human beings," he said. "It can be a powerful thing seeing how a family can fall apart but also come back together after the worst tragedy."
"Waves" filmed mostly in Broward County in South Florida. But there is a scene at Weeki Wachee, "one of my favorite places on Earth," Shults said.
Shults said he has been in Orlando a few years and listed what he and his girlfriend enjoy, including their house, their neighborhood, the restaurants, Disney and the kayaking.
Would he film here?
"Who knows? Maybe. I love Orlando," Shults said.
He said he had no idea about his next film. "I'm a blank slate. I put it all in this movie," he said.
Enzian hopes that he will attend some screenings, and Shults said he admired the Maitland theater.
Matthew Curtis, programming director at Enzian, said "Waves" is "incredibly bold filmmaking, powerful and heartbreaking, bursting with extraordinarily vivid performances that are hard to shake."
It's very unusual for Enzian to present a main feature by a local filmmaker. " 'The Blair Witch Project' 20 years ago may be the last time this has happened," Curtis said.
As for awards talk, Shults said, "It's humbling, it's great to hear it, you never know how any of that stuff will go. I'm just trying to get this movie out there and just trying to get word of mouth." He added, "There's a ton of great movies right now. I just hope ours can break through."
So spread the word: We have a major filmmaker living in our community.

Texto completo: The Northwest Cultural Council is excited to announce its current exhibit that honors one of America’s outstanding modern poets, Mary Oliver.
The exhibit at Arlington Green Executive Center is comprised of single works by 17 of the council’s artists. Each artist has selected one of Oliver’s poems as inspiration for their piece. The poem is displayed adjacent to each work and will be read aloud during a reception for the artists Dec. 7.
In addition to Oliver’s work, two original poems by council artists are on display. The exhibit will run through Jan. 4.
Mary Oliver was born in Ohio in 1935 and spent her adult life in New England, then in Florida, where she died in January of this year.
From a young age, she immersed herself in nature and was quoted as saying, "When it’s over, I want to say: ‘All my life/I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.’" Her first collection of poems was published in 1963, when she was 28. Oliver received numerous awards and recognition throughout her life. In 2007, The New York Times described her as "far and away, this country’s best-selling poet."
This exhibit contains photography, stained glass, watercolor, oil and acrylic painting, as well as bas-relief sculpture. Participating artists include Mary Blinn, Steve Bogaerts, Joe Burlini, Cheryl Calderon, Dean Caminiti, Robert R. Cobb, Roger Gates, John Green, James Hojnacki, Karen Meadows, Moon Ja Park, Linda Nye, Lynnea Semasko, Gary Swiontek, Tom Warnke, Nancy Wedow and Tiffany Whisler.
Through the generosity of one of the council’s ongoing sponsors, RF Wittmeyer, Ltd., the public is invited to a reception with refreshments from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 7. Some of the artists will have gift items for sale.
There is ample free parking at Arlington Green Executive Center, 2101 S. Arlington Heights Road, Arlington Heights.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

JOHNSON HAS 'NO SENSE OF DECENCY' MOMENT; VIEWS OF THE CAPITAL TIMES

Texto completo: Wisconsin's U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is a robotic defender of Donald Trump. Unbothered by evidence that the president lied to him during a phone conversation about the Ukraine scandal that has sparked an impeachment inquiry, Johnson has championed the president so ardently that he sparks disbelief. During an interview last month on NBC's "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd interrupted the Wisconsinite to say, "Sen. Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you, instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?"
Yet, Johnson has kept at it. Even after evidence emerged that he was part of an "irregular channel" of administration aides, appointees and allies who were involved in wrangling over the withholding of aid to Ukraine as part of a scheme to force the country's president to do Trump's domestic political bidding, Johnson kept making excuses. Even after The New York Times headlined an article about Johnson: "?He's in Deeper Water Than Most': G.O.P. Senator at Center of Impeachment Inquiry," he has remained obscenely loyal to Trump.
That was painfully obvious last week, a few hours before Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman delivered damning testimony about Trump's wrongdoing to the House Intelligence Committee, at the beginning of an extraordinary week of impeachment hearings. As the decorated military veteran who has served as a top National Security Council staffer was preparing to testify, he was the subject of a crude and dishonest attack by Johnson.
"A significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style and his intrusion onto their 'turf,'" Johnson wrote in a letter to committee Republicans. "They react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office. It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile."
Johnson the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a fierce partisan who recently declared that he does not trust the FBI and the CIA was not dealing in facts. He was seeking to prop up the desperate Republican effort to defend an embattled president.
The attack on Vindman revealed that Johnson's moral compass is broken. And U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Town of Vermont, called him out for it. "Sen. Ron Johnson's unsubstantiated attacks on Lt. Col. Vindman a decorated, Purple Heart veteran is what's wrong with Congressional Republicans," declared the congressman. "Attempting to discredit an American hero solely on behalf of an angry House GOP is unacceptable."
True enough. But there is another way to denounce Johnson by recalling the words of attorney Joseph Welch when he confronted one of the senator's predecessors.
"Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator," Welch told Joseph McCarthy. "You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

Texto completo: Re: "Let there be peace," Nov. 18 letter to the editor
To the author:
Do you not understand that members of our Air Force must train somewhere so they are prepared and ready to protect us? My husband was in the Air Force during the Korean Conflict. We have a son who has just retired as a lieutenant colonel with the USAF after 32 years. Both sacrificed being away from family for holidays and special occasions.
While you sit down to a beautiful table filled with the aroma of turkey and stuffing and some pumpkin pie, I hope a jet flies over this area to remind you we have military eating K-rations in the sands of foreign deserts protecting you.

Easing the load One in five teens living in the United States suffers from a mental illness severe enough to impact their daily abilities. Two states have already passed laws that allow students to take time off for mental health issues.
I think it is important for more states to follow the example of those progressive states that are rising to the challenge of helping youth in crisis.
High school students have to deal with more than they should at their age, from depression and anxiety, to the fear of school shootings, family problems and trying to negotiate their academics and their futures. Teenagers have an overflowing plate of responsibilities. When you then consider the pressure of extracurricular sports, clubs and activities, it becomes easy to understand how a teenager's life is not as easy as it may appear.
My teacher at school said, "Don't bring me grievances, bring me solutions." So, my solution to ease the burden of both teachers and teenagers is to move to a four-day work week to ease the stress, while allowing time to maintain better mental and emotional health.

President Trump and vaping Now that the extent of the vaping health crisis is becoming more evident, and has hit us locally as evidenced by the front-page story of Nov. 18, I think attention should be called to the New York Times story of Nov. 17 stating that President Trump has retreated from his September proposal to ban flavored "vapes" because of "political fallout among voters."
As a former smoker and survivor of lung cancer, I know the misery that lung disease can incur, and if my grandchildren and great-grandchildren can be saved from that misery, I am for anything that will deter them from starting an unhealthy habit.
This is another example of the president caving to contributors and political advisers for his own benefit, ignoring the general welfare (and perhaps that of his youngest son).
Paul Dyke, Desert Hot Springs
Bury power lines for safety Based on the article entitled, "EMF Pollution from Living Near Power Lines," (https://www.safespaceprotection.com/) people exposed to high voltage power lines and other collateral power transmission devices and networks exponentially increase their risk of cancer and other related health problems.
The article specifically mentions that the closer you are in proximity to power lines, the more you are bombarded with dangerous EMFs. These power lines handle electric power transmission and distribution across large distances.
Overall, the United States should take control in burying power lines safely underground because they are dangerous, and because there is empirical evidence that the lines harm humans.

The situation in Syria If the military of one nation goes into a second nation, without its government's permission, that is an invasion.
Any military actions by the first nation are acts of war.
Any armed group that does acts of violence against the government of the second nation are rebels, who must be put down.
This is Syria, today.

Texto completo: Whether your holiday season involves gatherings with family and friends for whom fun comes easily - or more fraught festivities where social grooves need some greasing - a good game can come in handy. Perennial favorites like Yahtzee, backgammon, Life, Boggle and Risk are sure-fire, and a newer discovery like What Do You Meme (an adults-only card game in which you create memes using the photos on the cards you are dealt) could spice things up.
We turned to some Hartford-area folks for their favorites. Let the games begin!
Amanda Aronson, principal, Aronson Consulting:
"Rummikub is our family game, and I'm proud to say I am the reigning champ." This family-friendly game is a version of rummy, but played with tiles instead of cards. Its makers say it's one of the world's most-played games; they also tout that it promotes STEM skills. Don't tell the kids!
Deb Greeson Cohen, Realtor and The Front Door Project blogger:
"We love Farkle or, believe it or not, pickup sticks! Someone got those a couple years ago and we played all day on Christmas!" Farkle's a dice game; you earn points by rolling the right combinations - but you have to decide whether to stop or keep rolling and risk losing your points in a "Farkle." As the listing on Amazon says, "Even if you do Farkle, it's fun just saying Farkle, right?" As for pickup sticks, it's a good reminder how much simple fun it can be to try to lift a stick from a pile without moving any others.
Elysha Dicks,co-founder, producer and host of Speak Up Storytelling:
"Sorry! is a great game to play with little kids. It is great practice for being disappointed and for winning and losing gracefully. Plus counting practice for the extra littles." In Sorry! players move colorful pawns around a board - and get to bump each other out of the way. She adds that her husband and son love Exploding Kittens, a card-game version of Russian roulette, only with... kittens. Its maker claims that "It was the most-funded game in the history of Kickstarter and has paved the way for peace and tranquility in the modern world. It also features cards illustrated by The Oatmeal."
Gretchen Fountain,development director at RE-Center Race & Equity in Education:
"Catch Phrase!" In this oldie-but-goodie, players try to get their teammates to guess the word or phrase on a card they've drawn before the buzzer goes off, using gestures and other clues. I can vouch for this one; we played it a lot when my kids were young.
Jenni Darius French,director of communication and strategic engagement at the Watkinson School:
"My family does the Saran Wrap Ball game every year on Christmas Eve... it is hysterical! My family plays with an added wrinkle; the person unwrapping the ball must wear oven mitts!" Before the game, the organizer wraps gifts of varying sizes and value amid layers of plastic wrap, creating a big ball of gifts. Players sit on the floor in a circle; one unwraps the ball, holding it in his or her lap, while the player to the left rolls a pair of dice. When that player gets a double, the ball and dice pass to other players. Players keep whatever gifts they unwrap.
Jacques Lamarre, playwright and senior project manager at BuzzEngine:
"Bananagrams!" Bananagrams is kind of like Scrabble on speed - but without a board. Players race to create a crossword grid using the letter tiles they've drawn; the first one to use all of his or her tiles hollers "Peel!" and everyone has to draw more tiles. The first to finish yells "Bananas!" The other players check his grid for errors; if they find one, it's a "spotted banana," but if it's all good, the player is that round's "top banana." The game comes in a banana-shaped pouch that's easy to tote to a party. And the yelling is half the fun.
Betsy Bucher Maguire,playwright for historical societies, museums and nonprofit organizations:
"We like Decrypto, Dixit, Pick Your Poison, Your Worst Nightmare, Code Names, Monikers, Secret Hitler, Sheriff of Nottingham, Snake Oil, Zero, The Metagame, Rate It, and good old reliable Balderdash!" Betsy's daughter Kerrie Maguire, a game and narrative designer, also voted for Monikers! "The game is three rounds consisting of games most people already know how to play (Taboo, Password, charades). Super fun!"
In Balderdash, players write down definitions of a word or description on the card that's been drawn, then read their definitions aloud. Fellow players have to judge whether the definition is real or the player reading it is bluffing. Unlike many card-based games, it's also a board game in which players move pieces as they score points by fooling the others or calling someone's bluff. Some of the content is for mature audiences, many Amazon reviewers note.
Monikers has players divide into teams and choose cards bearing famous (and some not-so-famous) names; in each of three rounds, players have to offer clues to get their teammates to guess the name. Anything goes in the first round; you can give any kind of clue you want, so long as you don't actually say the name. In the second round, though, you're only allowed to make a single sound or say a single word. The third round is charades. In its 2018 Holiday Gift Guide, The New York Times called Monikers "the perfect party game."

Texto completo: The Sheraton Portland Hotel restaurant has a confused decor and cocktail menu, but some more than decent entrees.
City Farmhouse Kitchen & Bar is a decent South Portland restaurant whose success or failure does not depend on your business. That's because you're probably not its target customer.
I say "probably" because there is a vanishingly tiny chance that you are a business traveler, a member of a flight crew on an overnight stopover from the Jetport, or someone who lives or works near the Sheraton Portland Hotel on Sable Oaks Drive.
"Let me get this right," my Lyft driver asked me last week. "You live in Portland, but you're going to a hotel near the Maine Mall for dinner?" When I confirmed, he shook his head and gently tried to talk me down from what he clearly considered to be a disastrous choice. "Listen, there's a lot of good stuff in Portland. Are you sure?" Then, as we pulled up to the newly renovated former Marriott hotel, he backtracked, but just a bit. "Oooh," he exclaimed. "It looks nicer than I expected in there."
Once a generically corporate hotel restaurant/bar called Fire & Water, City Farmhouse has been renovated to evoke what executive chef Chris Merriam calls "a barn feel," with an enormous colorized photo of a tractor, reclaimed wood, mixed-texture panels of dried moss and grasses, and a host station made from a gnarly tangle of barbed stump roots. These rustic elements are offset by the linearity and edges of manufactured materials like poured concrete, tempered glass and steel.
"The thought behind it is a fusion," Merriam said. "It's city girl meets farm boy, then (she) goes back to the farm and brings that city appeal with her."
But often, the two ideas run parallel without ever connecting. Much of the dining room, with its juxtaposition of plaid tweed upholstery and rough boards against clinical white subway tile, feels mismatched - like a Rocky Mountain ski chalet built inside a hospital bathroom.
Cocktails on the rambling beverage menu are also a bit haphazard. Some, like the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel ($11), a savory, caper-sprinkled riff on a dirty martini, and the incendiary (both in terms of spice and flammability) Maine-Ga-Rita Shine ($11), showcase the bar staff's skills with a Boston shaker. On the other hand, a trio of ginger-based cocktails - the Daisy Duke Mai Tai ($11), floral Farmhouse Elders ($11) and Asian pear martini ($13) - barely qualify as alcoholic and seem to have nothing to do with the menu or setting. They, like the syrupy Smoked Old Fashioned ($12), are also far too sweet.
Food at the casual, New American restaurant often does a better job of bridging contemporary and traditional rural foodways, despite a couple of outright bombs like the distributor-sourced chocolate "popover" that turns out to be nothing more than a misidentified lava cake baked until stodgy and plated with a scoop of sticky vanilla gelato and a smear of torched marshmallow. Or deep-fried Brussels sprouts ($11) tossed with roasted root vegetables, crunchy candied walnuts and drowned in enough maple syrup to qualify them for a spot on the dessert menu.
Italian-inspired dishes are, by and large, much stronger. While the dough for the stone-hearth pizzas isn't made in-house, pies are rolled out and baked to-order, producing light, blistered crusts that work well with the kitchen's homemade pomodoro sauce. That's especially true of the roasted-tomato-topped smoky tomato pie ($13), which on my second visit to City Farmhouse, my server set down with a flourish as she proclaimed, "You're lucky you ordered this. This and the pasta are my favorite things on the menu."
I had been lucky enough on my prior visit to sample the pasta and knew she was onto something. My guest and I devoured our half-order of the fresh (from frozen) garganelli tossed in a cream-fortified, veal-and-beef ragu that came topped with a ball of burrata that wept cream and tendrils of cheese as it warmed through ($12 half/$21 full).
The bruschetta-esque triptych of Farmers toasts ($12) are also solid, if portioned a little stingily for the price. Both the roasted red pepper with olive oil and whipped ricotta, and the sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms with burrata, white balsamic and thyme are appealing enough, but the best of the bunch is the tomato with basil, garlic and balsamic vinegar "pearls" created in the kitchen's spherificator. It reminded me of a molecular gastronomy remix of Spanish pan con tomate.
Not all the kitchen's best dishes trace their roots back to Italy. The French-cut chicken ($23) is a classic American dish: juicy, skin-on roasted breast and drumette nestled into a generous mound of frothy, whipped sweet potato puree and plated alongside a tiny hillock of tender carrots and turnips. But the real star of the dish is an apple chutney that whispers in steamy curls of fragrant star anise and cinnamon.
And no modern American menu would be complete without a burger. City Farmhouse offers four, all featuring hefty, beautifully grilled Angus-and-chuck patties and toasted brioche buns. "Go for the Homestead," my enthusiastic server urged, pointing with her pen to its location on my menu. "It has an egg on it. Eggs are the way to my heart." Mine, too.
It, like the pizza before, turns out to have been a wise selection. The runny, sunny-side-up egg (griddled in a ring mold to retain its size and shape) lends the Homestead ($16) a breakfast-like quality that gets a boost from a muscular tranche of applewood-smoked bacon.
On my first visit, at an adjacent table, six prosperous-appearing bachelorette-party attendees in town from suburban New Jersey ordered a few Homesteads of their own, adding several Ketel One-fueled Cosmopolitans ($12) for good measure. "You're such a Carrie Bradshaw," one said to the bride as drinks arrived. "Sure, but she wouldn't eat a burger like that," the bride responded. "Neither would I normally. But I'm in a random hotel, and that guy's (i.e. mine) smells so good. Forget Carrie Bradshaw."
I couldn't help but wonder: In a region with so many restaurants, isn't there room for just one designed mostly for tourists?

Mark Ruffalo talks about new film 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

34 killed amid floods, mudslides NAIROBI — Kenya's interior minister says 29 people have been killed in mudslides, among the 34 people overall who lost their lives Saturday amid flooding in the East Africa nation. Heavy rains unleashed overnight floods in western Kenya. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said 17 people died in a mudslide in the village of Takmal in the Pokot Central district, while 12 others lost their lives in mudslides in the villages of Parua and Tapach in Pokot South. Five other people died when their car was swept away. Matiangi said the government sent military and police helicopters to help, but the scope of the disaster was not yet clear. (AP)

2 sentenced for hiding treasure LONDON — Two men from Wales were sentenced Friday for failing to follow Britain's rules on reporting discoveries of treasure. George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, dug up a Viking hoard of gold and silver in 2015 in a field in Eye in western England. Instead of reporting it, as required by law, the two hid some of the items, estimated to be worth millions of pounds, and sold others to dealers. Powell received a total term of 10 years, and Davies was sentenced to 8½ years. The judge told Powell and Davies that the “irony in the case" was that if they had followed the correct procedure, they might have been in line to receive up to half the value between them, the BBC reported. “But you wanted more," the judge told them.

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said former national security adviser John Bolton’s “advanced age” could be to blame for being locked out of his Twitter account after he left the Trump administration.
“Sometimes, I’ll use my father as an example, somebody who is of an advanced age may not understand that all you have to do is contact Twitter and reset your password if you’ve forgotten it so I’ll just leave it at that,” Grisham told Fox Business on Friday.
Bolton, 71, is two years younger than President Trump.
Bolton, who resigned in September, reemerged on Twitter on Friday after a more than two-month hiatus on the social media platform.
“Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned,” Bolton wrote.
Tweet
“We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,” he said, adding that the White House had refused to give him access to his account.
Tweet
He thanked Twitter for “rightfully returning control of my account.”
Tweet
Trump denied to Fox & Friends that he had anything to do with the matter.
Bolton told the New York Times that the White House “attached software” to his account.
“They would not give it back. A representative of mine spoke with John Eisenberg, who said he would get it released, and it never happened. So finally we went to Twitter.”
Eisenberg is the top National Security Council lawyer. The software referenced by Bolton may have been connected to efforts to archive tweets in following presidential records laws.

The Llama As Therapist

Texto completo: STOCKDALE, Texas - The 300-pound llamas strolled quietly through the corridors of the nursing home, lowering their heads to be petted by residents in wheelchairs and pausing patiently as staffers took selfies.
“Did you get a bath today?” one resident, Jean Wyatt, asked Tic, a white male llama owned by Zoe Rutledge. (He had.)
Zoe, a high school sophomore, was there with her parents, Jeff and Carol Rutledge, who keep 13 llamas and alpacas at their home here in Stockdale, an exurb of San Antonio. Three of their herd have passed the qualifying exam necessary to become registered therapy llamas, a test that involves being touched by strangers and remaining impassive when people nearby start arguing.
“You look for the ones that are mellow and calm,” said Zoe, explaining how her family chose the animals they take to assisted living facilities, nursing and veterans’ homes, rehabilitation centers and walkathons for groups like the Down Syndrome Association of South Texas.
Llamas and alpacas - popular in TV commercials, as toys and on all manner of apparel - are simultaneously growing more common in therapeutic settings. While a handful are registered with Pet Partners, a national nonprofit clearinghouse for therapy animals, most are simply family farm pets whose owners take them to hospitals, college campuses and senior centers to ease people’s stress.
The novelty factor is a big part of the appeal, along with the creatures’ big-eyed, empathetic gaze. Among the animals that biologists refer to as charismatic megafauna - tigers, elephants, giant pandas and the like - llamas, which are not endangered, are among the few that people can safely hug.
“For some people, dogs are a little too much, or they’ve had a bad experience with them,” said Niki Kuklenski, a longtime llama breeder in Bellingham, Washington, who was one of the first to use the animals for therapeutic purposes. She said that her llamas, especially a female named Flight, “will read people. So when she goes into a setting where someone’s really animated and excited to see her, she’ll put her head down for a hug.”
But if someone seems apprehensive, “Flight will stand stock still,” Kuklenski said. “She is very cool.”
Don’t forget llama insurance
At Pet Partners, 94% of the registered therapy animals are dogs, but there are 20 llamas and alpacas in the mix, said Elisabeth Van Every, a spokeswoman for the group. (Most are llamas, which are much larger than alpacas and typically far friendlier to humans.) People who register their animals are covered under Pet Partners’ insurance for the duration of their therapy visits, and must abide by strict rules about health, grooming and working conditions. No animal may work more than two hours a day, and handlers must be aware of any signs of fatigue or annoyance.
Llama owners will tell you that their pets have a sixth sense about people who are needy, ill or frail. Carol Rutledge says that her therapy llama, whose name is Knock, will walk voluntarily to the bedside of a hospice patient and stand in silence while the patient reaches for him. “It wrenches at your heart,” she said. “It’s taken me several visits to be able to get through it without getting emotional.”
Mona Sams, an occupational therapist in Roanoke, Virginia, has eight llamas and five alpacas at her practice, which serves children with autism and other disorders, as well as adults with developmental disabilities. One patient is a girl with severe cerebral palsy and seizures who comes twice a week. “I have one llama” - named Woolly - “who literally sits there with her for a whole hour, face to face,” Sams said. “She calls Woolly her ‘counselor,’ and she will spend the first part of the hour telling Woolly what difficulties she’s had, and he just sits beside her for that entire time.”
Sams is the lead author of what seems to be the only published study involving the use of llamas as therapy animals. The article, published in 2006 in the American Journal of Occupational Therapy, describes a very small clinical trial in which children with autism were given either standard occupational therapy or therapy that involved handling llamas. The results “indicated that the children engaged in significantly greater use of language and significantly social interaction in the occupational therapy sessions incorporating animals than in the standard occupational therapy sessions,” the study authors wrote.
Hal Herzog, an anthrozoologist and professor emeritus of psychology at Western Carolina University, said that such results are not surprising, though they do not prove the efficacy of animal-assisted therapy. He says there’s a big mismatch between what the public believes - or wants to believe - about the effectiveness of therapy animals and what scientific studies show.
“The evidence for the short-term, probably transient, effects of interacting with animals in nursing homes or for autistic kids is quite good - petting a dog, or interacting with a llama, stress levels go down,” Herzog said. “But when we think of therapy, we think about long-term treatment, and I think the evidence for that is mixed.”
In Sams’ llama study, for example, he said, the children who got the standard therapy were doing “boring stuff” compared with the children who got to play with llamas. “I have no objection to that llama study, if it makes the kids feel better for a time, but I wouldn’t call it therapy,” said Herzog, author of the animal ethics book “Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat.”
He also pointed out that many people who research the human-animal bond are what he calls “true believers,” eager to validate the positive influence of pets and emotional support animals. “As an animal lover myself, I really wanted to believe it, too,” Herzog said, adding that his research led him to a different conclusion.
Not for everyone
Llama therapy is certainly not for everyone. While llamas are gentle creatures that seldom spit at humans, some people find their large stature intimidating or get spooked at seeing livestock indoors. On the flip side, some llamas aren’t cut out for the job: The two notorious runaway llamas that escaped onto a highway near Phoenix in 2015 had bolted from a visit to an assisted-living residence.
When two of the Rutledge family’s three therapy llamas - Tic and Knock - arrived at the Stockdale Residence and Rehabilitation Center for a regular visit, Bill Smallwood, a resident who is disabled from a motorcycle accident, accepted a small hair brush from Zoe and began grooming her llama. Smallwood is nonverbal, she said, but when the llamas are there, he will murmur and make wordlike noises.
This summer, for a science competition for 4-H Club, Zoe compared the blood pressure readings of three of the nursing home’s residents, including Smallwood and Wyatt, before and after the llamas visited. Her hypothesis proved correct: Most of the time, their blood pressure was lower after the llamas left, and, observationally, they seemed happier.
Bobbie West, the nursing home’s activities director, said she kept it secret when the llamas were scheduled to visit, lest staff and residents get too excited. “They love the llamas,” she said. “One lady, she can be in the foulest of moods, and when the llamas come, she just gets a whole new aura to her.”

Texto completo: The Puritans
By David D. Hall
Princeton, 517 pages, $35
The Trials of Thomas Morton
By Peter C. Mancall
Yale, 278 pages, $30
The debate about the meaning of early American history has become a debate about the meaning of America itself. Over the past few months, for instance, the New York Times's "1619" project has attempted to re-center the American story around the moment when, 400 years ago last August, more than 20 kidnapped Africans were sold to colonists in Virginia.
Great and tragic stories may be hung around these kinds of anniversaries -- and it has been no easy task for historians or for members of the public to come to terms with the beginnings of African-American slavery, the horrors of the "peculiar institution," or the war that was fought at least partly in its defense. But, as a raft of books on the early colonial period illustrate, historical experience doesn't easily lend itself to grand and sometimes simplistic national narratives.
Slavery existed in North America long before the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the ship with the bitterly appropriate name of White Lion -- and the victims of greed and inhumanity whom we have recently remembered arrived before any members of the religious community whose experience would do much to define centuries of colonial experience and the notions of "liberty" with which they have become associated.
One of the unintended consequences of efforts to "decolonize" the curriculum has been to debunk any utopian fantasies about the precolonial past. America has no single origin narrative, and no single moment of temptation and fall. As books by David D. Hall and Peter C. Mancall demonstrate, history is more complicated than the stories we choose to remember or struggle to forget.
In narratives that nod toward the approaching 400th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower, these two outstanding historians consider the circumstances in which Puritan settlers first encountered indigenous peoples in the regions that became known as New England. In 1620, as Mr. Hall reminds us in "The Puritans: A Transatlantic History," members of a small and vulnerable new religious movement made the difficult journey across the Atlantic to establish homes, communities, habits and cultures in a dangerous and unpredictable New World. Barely surviving their first winter, after forging mutually beneficial friendships with the region's indigenous inhabitants, these pilgrims celebrated their first Thanksgiving in October 1621, providing all those who would join their colonial experiment with a creation story and a sacramental feast that would be used to define a generous and inclusive national community. Of course, this memory is in many ways ironic, for the community that founded the Plymouth Colony had abandoned any hope of inclusion within the established Church of England, and their relationship to the native peoples they encountered would be driven by hope, fear, exploitation and a determined struggle for power.
The Puritans who landed at Plymouth were not the first travelers from England to have to come to terms with a suddenly expanding world. As Mr. Mancall notes in "The Trials of Thomas Morton," his account of how an energetic and determined troublemaker provoked major tensions within this Puritan community, English contacts with North America actually dated from the late 15th century. John Cabot sailed from Bristol to Newfoundland in 1497. From the 1570s, English boats returned to the area to fish for cod. By the early 1600s, some of these sailors had ventured onto land and begun writing up their expeditions in narratives that could be read as travel adventures or as advertising copy for a colonial project, like that established at Jamestown in 1607. This New World was paradise, these publicists beamed, populated by friendly natives who were only too happy to share the bounty of their environment. And, as proof of their claims, the first explorers brought home human cargo -- stolen Americans who in their captivity had been taught to speak English and compelled to facilitate the systemic exploitation of their home.
This fake news of liberty, abundance and prosperity found a ready audience, among them members of the religious communities whose long experience of harassment and persecution is narrated so vividly in "The Puritans." Mr. Hall's magisterial work provides a ground-breaking international history of this controversial religious movement as it emerged in the Old World and evolved to shape the New. In constructing his chronicle, Mr. Hall, an emeritus professor at Harvard Divinity School, builds upon a career of extraordinary achievement in this field. His voluminous endnotes compress many decades of wide reading into what will become one of the definitive histories of its subject.
His narrative focuses on the century following upon the English and Scottish reformations of the 16th century. While the campaign for moral renewal was largely successful in Scotland, it failed in England, where efforts to create a godly society gave way to disputes about what a godly society ought to look like and how it might require a re-organization of the church. When it became clear that the old wineskins could not contain the new wine, a small but growing number of radical voices pushed for a "reformation without tarrying" -- for reforms that could not be achieved within the old structures of the state.
Almost inevitably, these believers began to plan for emigration. The emerging democratic culture of the congregations that they established fed into preferences in local political organization that turned out to be fundamental to the evolution of American political life. But despite their success in the English civil wars and the largely successful republican experiment under Oliver Cromwell, the Puritans made no similar impression in the Old World. This is why, Mr. Hall's work suggests, Puritanism remains so peripheral in accounts of British history while remaining central to the naming -- and claiming -- of New England.
In a brilliant riposte to scholarly conventions, and one that many scholars might want to qualify, Mr. Mancall works to undermine those kinds of claims in "The Trials of Thomas Morton." Picking apart the standard accounts of New England's beginnings, he reconstructs an early colonial experience that is troubled and contested, one that provides a powerful counter-narrative to the traditional accounts that have been institutionalized as cliches in the Thanksgiving tradition. Mr. Mancall, who teaches history and anthropology at the University of Southern California, focuses upon Thomas Morton, an individual who worked hard to disrupt the early colonial experiment.
Mr. Mancall describes New England from the perspective of a lawyer who was banished from the colony on three separate occasions. Morton had fled to the New World to escape complex family tensions, but as the publicist for an alternative colonial adventure, he found himself at the center of escalating political controversy. His only publication, "New English Canaan" (1637), combined his interests in natural history, anthropology, economics and anti-Puritan invective to argue that an alternative New World was possible. His goal was to imagine new ways of combining the expertise of Native Americans and their English friends, promoting a cooperative and environmentally sustainable colonial program that made no concessions to Augustinian reminders that the New World was just as fallen as the Old. Morton had prejudices of his own -- on several occasions he compared the customs of the Native Americans to those of the "wild Irish." But he wrote of the colonial engagements with unusual sympathy and observed the Native American experience of colonialism as the slow unfolding of disaster. As stories circulated of the riotous behavior of his followers on the aptly named colony of Merrymount, Morton ended up as an outcast from his fellow colonists, the "Lord of Misrule" who dissented from the political and territorial ambitions of his English neighbors, as well as from their theology, and one of the few individuals to be banished from New England.
Messrs. Hall and Mancall conclude their complementary works by thinking about the legacy of their subjects. For Mr. Hall, Puritanism provided later Americans with a language of moral reform and social critique. Turning aside from the Calvinist theology of the first settlers, later Americans worked to establish different kinds of "city on a hill" and have regularly pushed for cultural and political change in other kinds of "reformation without tarrying." For Mr. Mancall, Thomas Morton's life and book had "a deep impact on early New England, and a lasting influence on American culture," inspiring environmentalists alongside those who have advocated for racial justice and for indigenous peoples' rights. These contrasting stories point to the competition between ethical systems that lies at the heart of so much of the recurring tragedy of American political, cultural and religious history. For all their differences, both the Puritans and those who made every effort to oppose them were working for a better world.

Texto completo: Herbert Whalen, who worked with Clayton Morris selling investment properties in Indianapolis, was charged with defrauding clients.
The former business partner of Clayton Morris, the Fox News host turned financial guru, was indicted by a federal grand jury and arrested at his home in Indianapolis on Thursday on charges that he defrauded real estate investors recruited by Mr. Morris.
The indictment, by a grand jury in Newark, charged the former partner, Herbert Whalen, with conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with the sale of houses to two investors -- one from New Jersey and one from New York. But the charging document also said Mr. Whalen and "his co-conspirators caused millions of dollars in losses."
According to the 11-page indictment, Mr. Whalen and others enriched themselves by "misrepresenting and concealing the poor condition" of the homes they were selling in Indianapolis and "creating fake leases" to make it appear that the single-family houses had rent-paying tenants in them.
The charges are similar to the claims raised by dozens of former customers of Mr. Morris and his firm, Morris Invest, in lawsuits filed in federal and state court. The litigation and the finger-pointing between Mr. Morris and Mr. Whalen were reported this year by The New York Times and The Indianapolis Star.
Mr. Whalen, 45, who is known as Bert, was held overnight at an Indianapolis jail. He appeared Friday afternoon before a federal magistrate judge in Indianapolis who set conditions for his release pending his arraignment in federal court in Newark.
His lawyer, John Tompkins, said his client "has never committed fraud, and he has never intended to or conspired to commit any fraud."
The investigation by the F.B.I. began over a year ago. Besides the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in New Jersey, the state attorneys general from Indiana and New Jersey are investigating the claims raised by investors. Mr. Whalen and Mr. Morris's company sold at least 1,000 houses in Indianpolis.
A spokesman for Craig Carpenito, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said he had no information on whether there would be additional charges.
The indictment does not refer to Mr. Morris or his business by name. The charging document refers to a company, based in New Jersey, whose owner is a resident of New Jersey. Until this summer, Mr. Morris and his family lived in Florham Park, N.J., before moving to Portugal.
David Hensel, the lawyer for Mr. Morris and his company, said his clients "commend the government for seeking justice for Bert Whalen's victims."
From Portugal, Mr. Morris has continued to post his popular weekly podcast and offer services that include selling investment homes and financial advice. A few weeks ago, he was scheduled to speak at a real estate conference in Philadelphia, but his appearance was canceled at the last minute.

Texto completo: For years, Chinese e-cigarette makers had free rein to operate without regard to consumer safety. But new rules are set to change that.
Models in tight dresses and high heels lounged in a yellow inflatable pool filled with plush toys and vaping equipment. Enthusiastic vapers lined up for free pens and pods, as clouds of mango, mint and rose mingled with the electronic dance music in the air.
Attendees of the Shanghai eCig Expo had a lot to celebrate. Vaping has surged in China, drawing money from domestic and Western investors alike. In a country with nearly as many smokers as the entire United States population, the growth potential seemed limitless.
"This," said Frank Wang, an aspiring entrepreneur who wanted to open his own vaping shop, "is where you can make money now."
Perhaps not anymore.
China has joined the United States and other governments in putting new pressure on vaping. Regulators have banned online sales of vaping products, and China's major propaganda outlets have heaped on scrutiny, citing the potential health effects. The government is considering banning vaping in public places.
Beijing's crackdown threatens an almost exclusively Chinese industry that had been counting on the country as a haven. Ninety percent of the world's e-cigarettes are made in China, and most of them are produced in Shenzhen, a southern city that borders Hong Kong. Some of the nation's top e-cigarette brands, including RELX, FLOW and Yooz, have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding from high-profile names like Sequoia China, IDG Capital and Matrix Partners China. The firms did not respond to requests for comment.
The new scrutiny adds to the troubles for Chinese e-cigarette exporters, already hammered by the vaping-related health crisis in the United States that has sickened at least 2,200 people and killed 47.
While exporters have long dominated China's e-cigarette industry, the domestic market took off only about three years ago. Of the 10 million e-cigarette users in China, most are young people who vape sleek, brightly colored devices with flavors like chilled strawberry and orange soda.
Euromonitor, the global market research consultancy, said China's e-cigarette market was worth $ 750.4 million in 2018, nearly triple the 2014 value. China has more than 300 million smokers, out of a population of nearly 1.4 billion. In the United States, 10.8 million adults vape.
Juul Labs, which is under fire in the United States for marketing its e-cigarettes to teenagers and children, wanted to cash in, too. But just days after it started business in China, its products were removed from Alibaba and JD.com, two of the biggest e-commerce platforms. Neither the government nor the company gave any explanation. Juul had paid to be at the e-cigarette fair in Shanghai starting in late October but withdrew at the last minute because of the crisis in the United States, according to Li Wangfeng, project director of the expo.
Concerns are mounting about the hazards of vaping among the young, prompting many Chinese to call for regulations. A 2018 tobacco survey commissioned by China's Center for Disease Control found that people 15 to 24 years old were the most avid vapers, with most buying their devices online.
In recent weeks, the state news media has kept up its drumbeat of negative coverage of the industry. On Nov. 4, the most-read article on the website of People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, noted that most e-cigarette companies continued selling their products online despite the ban. The next day, China's state broadcaster, China Central Television, showed Beijing officials summoning companies to comply with the ban. The day after that, e-cigarettes were no longer available on Alibaba's Taobao and JD.com, two of China's most popular e-commerce platforms.
For years, the Chinese government allowed the lucrative e-cigarette industry to thrive with no supervision. There was never any consensus on whether e-cigarettes should be classified as tobacco, health or electronics products and which agency should regulate them. Part of the problem, too, is that China's top tobacco authority is both a regulator and a producer of cigarettes.
In an industry with low barriers to entry, manufacturers took advantage of this void. According to Tianyancha, a corporate database in China, the country has more than 9,500 e-cigarette companies.
Many of these brands have haphazard quality controls that have resulted in knockoffs, unsafe ingredients and vape liquid leakage, but the authorities have rarely policed these companies. In March, CCTV said eight e-cigarette companies made vaping oils with nicotine levels that were higher than what the package stated.
Alarmed by these reports, the government is set to force producers to comply with standards on ingredients and manufacturing, according to a draft viewed by The New York Times.
Once the "national standard" is enacted, companies would be required to provide details on the number and dosage of ingredients, put warnings on packages and devise ways of testing e-cigarettes to ensure compliance.
The process would increase production costs, industry experts say, and is likely to put many small e-cigarette exporters out of business.
But Ou Junbiao, head of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee of China trade group, said he welcomed the rules because they would give him clear guidelines. He said that previously many companies like his never dared to sell in China for fear of running afoul of the government.
"Once the national standard comes out, I can follow its targets and make big investments," said Mr. Ou, a former factory worker and owner of Sigelei, one of China's top e-cigarette exporters to the United States, in his office in Shenzhen. "I won't have to worry that something will happen, but now I don't know which day the sword would fall."
E-cigarette executives in China were unanimous in attributing the vaping-related illnesses in the United States to the use of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and vitamin E acetate. The majority of the American victims had vaped THC, but some say only nicotine was involved.
In Shenzhen, several vaping manufacturers have laid off workers, according to two labor recruiters.
At the Shanghai expo, Chen Lin, a sales manager for a company that produces parts of e-cigarette atomizers, said his company's sales fell 80 percent in the past month.
"We basically have no orders coming in this month after what happened in the United States," said Mr. Chen, who attended the expo to look for business partners.
Within China, RELX has become the dominant seller of e-cigarettes and controls 44.4 percent of the market for closed vaping systems, e-cigarette pens that come filled, according to data from Euromonitor. It has nearly $ 286 million in financing, according to its founder, Kate Wang, from major venture capital firms like Sequoia China.
Ms. Wang started RELX in 2017, after testing 20 e-cigarettes in the Chinese market and discovering they did not meet her expectations. She said she was motivated to help her two-pack-a-day father quit smoking.
Jiang Xingtao, whose title is "director of flavors" at RELX, said that while vaping was safer than smoking tobacco, the jury was still out on whether it is definitively safe.
He is collecting data in RELX's lab in Shenzhen to determine the risks and wants to run clinical trials, singling out the flavoring ingredients.
"We can guarantee that they are safe to be consumed through the stomachs, but is it safe enough to be absorbed through the lungs?" Mr. Jiang said. "To be honest, in this respect, neither we nor the industry has evidence that is particularly solid."
Yiwei Wang contributed research.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg will spend tens of millions of dollars on television ads, which would set a record, in at least 100 media markets across the country starting next week, a sign that he could announce his presidential campaign in the coming days.
The ads, some of which are 60 seconds long, are expected to air from Nov. 25 through Dec. 3. They are expected to cost Bloomberg at least $30 million, the New York Times and ABC reported. The sum is more than half of the about $50 million all the other Democratic presidential candidates combined have spent on television ads this year, according to FiveThirtyEight.
Ad spending tracking group Advertising Analyics said that the ad buy would be the largest-ever sum spent in one week by a candidate. President Barack Obama holds the current record of $24.9 million spent during the last week of his presidential campaign.
The former New York mayor has filed to appear on Democratic primary ballots in some states and, on Thursday, filed statement of candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. But his team indicated that the steps were formalities while he decides whether to launch a presidential campaign, and he has yet to announce a bid personally.
Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $54 billion, is expected to self-finance his campaign and skip competing in the first four early nominating contest states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Instead, he will focus on winning delegates from primaries on the March 3 "Super Tuesday" and beyond.
Tom Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager worth about $1.6 billion who is also largely self-financing his campaign, is the only other presidential candidate to spend unusually large sums of money on television ads so far in the 2020 cycle. He has spent about $39 million so far on television ads.
Other Democratic presidential candidates have criticized Bloomberg's expected late entry into the large field of candidates and accused him of trying to buy the election.

Texto completo: According to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission, the Republican National Committee spent almost $100,000 on bulk purchases of Donald Trump, Jr. 's book "Triggered" as part of an incentive scheme for Republican donors.
The filing shows the Republican National Committee spending $94,800 at the bookstore "Books-A-Million" for "donor mementos," on Oct. 29 a few days before Trump's book was released on Nov. 5.
At the Books-A-Million retail price for "Triggered" of $30. 00, that would be about 3,160 copies of the book.
Mike Reed, an RNC spokesman, explained to The New York Times that the expenditure at Books-A-Million had gone toward copies of Trump's book.
"The book has been hugely popular," he said, noting that the RNC had made additional purchases of the book in November.
Last week, another RNC spokesman, Steve Guest, said in a statement to the Associated Press the book had been purchased as a fundraising incentive for donors, but that the book was bought "to keep up with demand" instead of a "large bulk purchase. "
When asked about the single large expenditure on books, Reed told the Times that the RNC stood by its previous statement.

Trump's book has been in the top spot on The New York Times bestseller list for "combined print and e-book nonfiction" for two weeks, a fact that Trump's father, President Donald Trump, has highlighted.
The book's position on the bestseller list had been caveated with a dagger symbol, which meant that some of the book's sales were bulk purchases, according to the Associated Press. Bulk purchases sometimes indicate that the author himself or someone associated with him bought a large number of copies.
Trump retweeted posts from conservative reporter Ryan Saavedra and Trump campaign adviser and partner Kimberly Guilfoyle about the book that argued the book could have been a bestseller even without the RNC's purchases.
"This book and its author are something special," Guilfoyle wrote.

Texto completo: American Cooking
By Dale Brown (1968)
1. "Equal parts of bounty, diversity and ingenuity" is how James Beard cheerfully sums up our national cuisine in the preface to "American Cooking," part of a 27-book Time-Life series called "Foods of the World." The America of this book basks in a golden glow reminiscent of "Oklahoma!" No TV dinners intrude here. Folksy characters enthusiastically relish Rhode Island clambakes and Southern church suppers; Appalachian mules grind sorghum into syrup. The nation in the 1960s may have been rocked by student rebellion and other expressions of social unrest, but in this picture of America, old-fashioned values—the culinary kind, at any rate—still count. Not everyone agreed with this vision. In 1974, National Lampoon published a piece called "The Cooking of Provincial New Jersey," perfectly reproducing the breathless Time-Life style with titles like "The Prepared Food Mixes: From Powder to Perfection" and "Twenty-One Cuisines, One Great Taste." Nevertheless, the rediscovery of farm-to-table over recent decades testifies to the long-term validity of this optimistic snapshot of American taste.
Something From the Oven
By Laura Shapiro (2004)
2. A memorable work about women and food. The 1950s have long been burdened by sneers about huge cars with fins and dishes like tuna-noodle casserole and Jell-O salad. But in defense of postwar cuisine, it can at least be said that Americans cooked their own meals and didn't spend nearly as much money as we do today on food prepared by other people. Women, who did most of the cooking, were regularly confronted with advertising persuading them to try this or that frozen or dehydrated product. But, as Laura Shapiro points out, "straight through the 1950s women kept cooking. . . . And straight through the '50s, the food industry . . . insisted that women weren't cooking; they didn't want to cook, they had no time to cook." There was a reason. Food companies profited more from processed products than from staples. The Pillsbury Co. sponsored a wildly successful contest, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, featuring women skilled at baking and confident of that skill. But there was also the "Can Opener Cookbook" by Poppy Cannon. What did it say that this work, premised on the idea that cooking is a drag, became a best-seller with its "Frizzled Ham With Bananas Haitian" (involving canned ham, bananas and rum) and a floating-island dessert made from lemon Jell-O and Royal instant custard?

Roadfood
By Jane Stern and Michael Stern (1980)
3. "Roadfood" offered a way to discover real food and avoid the numbing, processed sameness of the off ramp. The second edition (1980) describes it as "a survival guide for cross-country travelers or a directory of regional cuisines." Rather than exalting nearly extinct traditions such as Southern beaten biscuits or Boston baked beans, the Sterns featured quirky specialties like the meat and potato pasties of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and mutton barbecue from Owensboro, Ky. The authors reported on diners, stands and restaurants that heroically carried on making their own chili, salad dressing or layer cake despite being endangered by fast food and new fashions. Because roadfooding can be "a dangerous business," the Sterns provided survival tips like "Do not order barbecued pork in Texas and do not order barbecued beef in the Carolinas." They advised staying away from "pre-fab" offerings at a West Virginia restaurant in favor of its homemade pies and honey chicken. To the extent that we now treasure the unpredictable and authentic, it is at least partly thanks to the Sterns.
High on the Hog
By Jessica B. Harris (2011)
4. It's no secret that the most important influence on American cuisine is African-American. As far back as 1895, the New York Times observed that insofar as there is a national cuisine, it is of African origin. Jessica Harris is an unmatched guide to African and American culinary combinations. Products such as yams and black-eyed peas were brought from Africa, but it was the New World that shaped most of the stories recorded here. African-American chefs such as James Hemings, who worked for Thomas Jefferson, became expert in French haute cuisine. Hemings brought back from France techniques for crème brûlée and meringue. He popularized waffles, bread stuffing and vanilla flavoring. Since Emancipation, Southern, "down home" and soul have represented different sides of African-American culinary distinctiveness—a tradition that has never been monolithic.
Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's
By Ray Kroc (1977)
5. Ray Kroc was a salesman for the kitchen-equipment company Prince Castle when he came across what Mac and Dick McDonald had created in San Bernardino, Calif.: a stripped-down, assembly-line restaurant offering burgers, fries and beverages with instant service, consistent quality and negligible overhead cost. "When I saw it working that day in 1954, I felt like some latter-day Newton who'd just had an Idaho potato caromed off his skull." It wasn't only the efficiency that mesmerized him, it was the pleasure the customers experienced. A young woman sitting in a yellow convertible was "demolishing a hamburger . . . her appetite magnified by the many people in the cars that filled the parking lot." Kroc is, above all, fanatically curious about kitchens, businesses and innovations. Not all of his ideas worked. Before McDonald's, he tried to get bars to use Multimixer milkshake makers to make alcoholic drinks with ice cream. His breakthrough idea about burgers wasn't completely original, but his drive and ruthlessness made McDonald's a world-wide juggernaut. His story evokes the magical allure of fast food when it was new.

Life &amp; Arts -- Film Review: A Deep Dive for the Truth in 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo plays a suddenly impassioned environmental attorney in "Dark Waters," a story that was his passion project; he took it to the director Todd Haynes, then served as one of the film's producers as well as its star.
The subject is corporate malfeasance that results in environmental pollution on a massive scale over a long period of time. If that makes you think of Erin Brockovich chasing down the source of hexavalent chromium, think again. Instead of Julia Roberts's crowd-pleasing flamboyance there's Mr. Ruffalo's earnest, admirably serious portrayal of Rob Bilott, a real-life defense attorney for chemical companies who became an environmental crusader, in and out of court, after switching sides to go after DuPont Co., an industry supergiant, on behalf of a grievously wronged farmer in West Virginia.
Mr. Haynes, a notable stylist whose work is sometimes tinged with surrealism, was an improbable choice to direct this material, though a fine one, as it turns out. Like Rob, the film isn't flashy, but it is honorable, admirable and improbably stirring -- for its hero's idealism and tenacity, for its devotion to detail and its straight-in-the-eye look at plain people living hard lives in a company town. (The cinematographer was Edward Lachman, Mr. Haynes's longtime collaborator. His work is first-rate, as always, though I wish he hadn't emphasized the region's grimness with a blue-skewed palette.)
The farmer, Wilbur Tennant, is played by one of the pre-eminent character actors of our day, Bill Camp. He's a study in coiled fury, as well he might be. When he and Rob first meet in 1998, Wilbur has lost 190 cows to an unknown something that causes deformities, aberrant behavior and rampant cancer, and he's been stonewalled in every effort to seek information. As Rob discovers through exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, research, the villain -- the physical villain -- is perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, huge quantities of which DuPont has dumped in a landfill near Wilbur's property, even though the company has known for years that the substance is highly toxic.
One of the hallmarks of good corporate-malfeasance stories is that they ramify. Rob's case is a prodigy of ramification, from one rural landfill to a nearby stream to global pollution of water and air. Once the case advances to the discovery phase, DuPont swamps Rob in documents, delivering so many boxes of them to his office in Cincinnati that it looks like the archive at the end of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
The script, based on a New York Times Magazine story by Nathaniel Rich, was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (his credit reads "earlier screenplay") and Mario Correa. It's lucid, dutiful and inevitably sprawling -- there's no easy way to structure a story that spans almost two decades before reaching a dramatic, and in this case dramatically financial, payoff. Anne Hathaway does as well as she can in the severely underwritten role of Rob's wife. But "Dark Waters" is Mr. Ruffalo's film, both in its gestation and execution, and his passion has been well served.

AJC GEORGIA FOOTBALL FROM THE FIELD TO THE LOCKER ROOM: It's not so hard to see Fromm staying

Texto completo: Scanning some of the latest 2020 NFL mock drafts -- God, what's happened to my life, it used to hold such promise -- there's one name that stubbornly refuses to show itself as a first-day possibility: Jake Fromm.
The junior Georgia quarterback, who will mull the decision to leave early for the draft once the Bulldogs run out of games, has done nothing this season to make that call automatic and easy. His stock has remained mostly flat as he guides an offense that doesn't feature its quarterback above all others, and he puts up numbers that are really good but fall south of gaudy.
Even a traumatic injury within the quarterbacking fraternity has done little to alter Fromm's rank within it.
Most of these pointless exercises still cling to Tua Tagovailoa as a first-rounder after his tricky hip surgery and an already busy medical history. And there was this from an Alabama website: "Three longtime NFL personnel guys told AL.com that if they had to bet on it, Tagovailoa would still go somewhere in the first half of the first round even after suffering the hip injury. Possibly even still in the top-10."
In all cases, Fromm comes in after LSU's Joe Burrow, Tagovailoa and Oregon's Justin Herbert. And in most cases he'd be taken behind Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts; and in some cases even behind one guy Fromm displaced at Georgia, Washington's Jacob Eason as well as Utah State's Jordan Love.
A couple of sites dare to extend themselves beyond the first round, and only in those does Fromm's name appear.
The quarterback draft order, featuring those select names above, from draftwire.usatoday.com:
1. Burrow; 4. Tagovailoa;
11. Herbert; 45. (second round) Hurts; 48. Eason;
80. (third round) Love; 94. Fromm.
And from draftsite.com:
1. Burrow; 3. Tagovailoa;
6. Herbert; 44. (second round) Fromm; 75. (third round) Hurts; 129. (fourth round) Eason; 165. (fifth round) Love.
Of course, the guesswork involved in such ranking, here before even the draft order is set, is along the lines of a butcher performing open-heart surgery in the dark.
And I'd argue that once NFL personnel people get to actually interview Fromm and come to gauge all those quarterbacking qualities that are immeasurable, somebody's going to get quite smitten.
Still, I'll use these imperfect tools to help fashion the unsolicited advice that Fromm be in no hurry to join the mercenaries at the next level. Right now, sticking around for his senior season at Georgia doesn't seem unfathomable at all.
Fromm, and The Decision (Georgia version) is one of the intriguing puzzles of the coming draft, his future the 5-star Sudoku atop the Saturday New York Times crossword.
Just watching him now, I see a player who might be well-served staying another year. We've seen him limited by the elements to 35 passing yards one game against Kentucky and surgically spay and neuter Florida with 279 yards and a pair of touchdowns the next game. He's thrown three interceptions in a loss against South Carolina and three touchdowns in a big win against Auburn. His two worst games in terms of completion percentage since his freshman season (both under 47 percent) have been his past two. There have been just enough "meh" moments thrown in with the "oh, my" ones to make coming back for his senior season more a possibility than most would have thought.
Don't assign Fromm the faint slander of "game manager;" he is assuredly more than that. Although he does rank 62nd among FBS quarterbacks in completions per game, 60th in yards per attempt, 71st in yards per game and 44th in passing touchdowns per game. Rather managerial numbers at that.
It's just that his job at Georgia doesn't entail him going pass-crazy. In fact, you didn't want him throwing too much -- he was 0-5 in games with 30 or more attempts until the Florida game this year.
Between running a system that values bludgeoning over the big play and trying to get on the same page with a new batch of young receivers, this has not been the kind of season in which Fromm has really shown off. Hey, next year always holds the possibility of doing more.
In terms of "arm talent" Fromm isn't the prettiest quarterback at the prom. That's why he gets passed over in these remote mock drafts; those strangers just don't get to know him the way the Bulldogs fan does.
No one can say for sure what kind of NFL quarterback Fromm will make -- I'd guess that he is going to be quite good, somewhere between Mitchell Trubisky and Aaron Rodgers. How's that for a wide range? Wish I could be more specific, but that is part of the mystery of Jake Fromm.
But I'm in no great hurry to find out exactly where exactly he falls as a pro.
More certain is the fact that Fromm is an extraordinary college quarterback, one who appeals to every selfish motive that he stays at Georgia long enough to get us all through the next election.

Texto completo: The troubled office space company is slashing its total work force as it sells businesses and outsources some jobs.
WeWork said on Thursday that it was laying off 2,400 employees around the world, weeks after huge losses at the co-working company brought it close to financial collapse.
The layoffs are equivalent to nearly 20 percent of the 12,500 employees WeWork said it had at the end of June. The company is also expected to shed another 1,000 employees as it closes or sells divisions that are not part of its core business of subletting office space. Additionally, roughly 1,000 building maintenance employees will be transferred to outside contractors.
In a statement, a WeWork representative said, "The company is making necessary layoffs to create a more efficient organization."
Under its former chief executive and co-founder, Adam Neumann, WeWork went on a frantic expansion that saddled the company with large losses. The company lost $ 1.25 billion in the three months that ended in September, more than twice as much as the company had lost in the same period a year earlier. Concern about WeWork's finances and its unusual corporate governance forced the company to withdraw its initial public offering in September.
The pullback at WeWork is being overseen by Marcelo Claure, a senior executive at SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that is WeWork's largest shareholder. SoftBank is now attempting a financial rescue of the company. It has invested $ 1.5 billion of new money in WeWork, but it is unclear how the rest of the bailout plan, which includes selling over $ 3 billion of new WeWork bonds to investors, is progressing.
WeWork's main business is leasing office space, fixing it up and then subletting the space to individuals and companies. Under Mr. Neumann, who stepped down from the chief executive post in September, WeWork also piled into other activities, including a private school in Manhattan and a rental housing business, WeLive.
Many WeWork employees held equity in the company and were hoping that the I.P.O. would deliver a big financial reward for the long hours they spent trying to turn the company into a new type of real estate giant. Employees expressed anger in a letter to management after learning that Mr. Neumann had received an exit package worth roughly $ 1 billion.
Starting next month, cleaning and facilities jobs at WeWork will be outsourced to JLL, a real estate services company, or one of its partners. WeWork told employees that every member of its cleaning and facilities teams would keep his or her job and receive similar pay and benefits. But those who don't transfer will lose their jobs and won't receive severance, according to a document provided to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times.
In its statement, WeWork said the laid-off employees would receive severance and benefits. "These are incredibly talented professionals, and we are grateful for the important roles they have played in building WeWork over the last decade," the statement said.

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
"I WANT TO START by suggesting to all of you that we shouldn't be here."
That's how New York Times op-ed stafF editor and writer Bari Weiss began her address to the crowd at the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia's Main Event on Nov. 14.
By "here," Weiss clarified, she didn't mean the cavernous Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center where the annual gala was being held. Rather, she meant that Jews existing in the world in 2019 is almost unthinkable, and maybe even miraculous. And for American Jews to have felt so secure for so long? It's been nothing less than a "holiday from history," Weiss said.
The theme of her speech gelled well with the theme of the evening, "Anti-Semitism and Security," and was echoed by the other Main Event speakers: Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia Board Chair Susanna Lachs Adler, President and CEO Naomi Adler and Main Event Co-Chair Marc Brownstein. They all spoke of the increasing need for Jewish communal security in Philadelphia and around the world.
Total revenue for the Main Event, including ticket sales and sponsorships, was $950,000.
Prior to the evening's remarks, which clocked in at just under an hour, nearly 850 community members gathered in several different areas throughout the Kimmel Center. In the main lobby, attendees were treated to sushi, dumplings and more, while elsewhere members of other Federation groups - the Joshua Society and NextGen - mingled at their own functions.
Outside, members of IfNotNow Philly protested Weiss' appearance.
Lachs Adler, the first speaker, emerged, as all speakers did, from the back of the stage through straight rows of potted trees. Lachs Adler compared the work of the Jewish Federation to that of a tree, putting down roots as branches stretch higher, providing all manner of nourishment arid comfort.

But the phrase "Tree of Life," she noted, had taken on a much darker connotation in the past year. Last year's Main Event took place just a few weeks after the massacre at the Tree of Life building in Pittsburgh; this year's Main Event took place in the world shaped by it.
"These acts of violence will not become our new normal," Lachs Adler said. "If we are going to be ready for the community's most urgent needs, we need to be ready the day before those needs arise."
Lachs Adler's address was followed by a short video extolling the virtues of the Secure Community Network, the national security initiative of the Jewish Federations of North America and Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
Next up were the Main Event's co-chairs, Amy and Marc Brownstein, alongside Jamie and Warren Klein. Marc Brownstein, speaking on behalf of the group, told the crowd how much they all appreciated the chance to work on the event.
"Organizing this Main Event has been a special opportunity to learn and appreciate how much the Jewish Federation does to keep us safe," he said. Brownstein cited the recent thwarting of an attack on a synagogue in Halle, Germany, as evidence of what Jewish Federations can do for the Jewish world: The Halle synagogue's security system and training were subsidized by an international fund to which Jewish Federation contributed.
Finally, Weiss, who recently published the book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," was introduced. She spoke with candor and vigor about the state of the American Jewish community, focusing especially on maintaining a balance between a particularistic sense of Jewish identity and an openness to allied outsiders. And she charted a course forward for American Jews through 10 broad ideas. She offered up the merits of totally subsidized Jewish day school, increased focus on Hebrew immersion and an end to the "boardroom" world of panel discussions as a substitute for action.
"What if the symbol of American Jewish life in the coming decades is the rally?" she asked.
Her overarching point was that all of her ideas - from incentivizing Jewish teens to go to college in Israel to empowering Mizrahi Jews - were meant to affirmatively combat anti-Semitism, rather than "play defense," as she put it.
"The way ahead, the way to build a world that is strong and safe and fulfilling for Jews, is by drilling down deep into our roots," she said.
Weiss' address was followed by a short speech from Naomi Adler, who thanked the evening's attendees for coming. "In these turbulent times, how inspiring it is to be with all of you as we take this moment to vow to be proactive and thoughtful," she said. "Not only to help make us physically secure, but to make sure we walk away from this event with a reservoir of strength." *

Texto completo: The police said the attack was under investigation and declined to say whether they believed it was a hate crime.
An Orthodox Jewish man was stabbed and slashed in a suburb near New York City on Wednesday morning, steps away from a local synagogue, and left bleeding on the ground, the police said.
The local police department said the attack was under investigation and declined to say whether they believed it was a hate crime.
Michael B. Specht, town supervisor of the suburb, Ramapo, which is in Rockland County, just north of Manhattan, said: "It's certainly a possibility the attack was a hate crime."
The stabbing was "an anomaly" in the town, Mr. Specht said, adding, "In the larger picture, it's hard not to think about other attacks on people in the Jewish community."
Police Chief Brad R. Weidel did not rule out that possibility at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon but was not, at that moment, "willing to say that this is a hate crime."
"Could it be a hate crime? Of course," he said, but noted that the police had "a legal obligation" to meet before making that determination.
Rockland County has more than 320,000 residents, according to census figures from 2018. More than 31 percent of those residents are Jewish, according to the state, which also says that Rockland has the largest Jewish population, per capita, of any county in the country.
Police officials gave few details about the attack, saying that information was still being gathered. The victim, who was walking to the synagogue, was approached from behind early on Wednesday and attacked by at least one person, the police said.
At about 5:49 a.m., officers responded to a call at Howard Drive in Monsey, which is within the town of Ramapo, and found the victim with multiple wounds.
It was "a vicious, violent attack," Chief Weidel said.
The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was taken to Westchester Medical Center, the police said. Mr. Specht said he was in critical condition.
Chief Weidel said the police were reviewing video from the nearby area but declined to release a description of any suspects. He said he needed time to confirm the details before releasing it publicly.
Aron Hershkowitz, a manager at the Toshnad Heichel Torah Utfila, said the attack was captured on two of the synagogue's 40 surveillance cameras.
Mr. Hershkowitz said footage from the cameras showed a vehicle stopping near a man walking toward the synagogue. Then, he says, someone hopped out from the driver side of the vehicle and attacked the person, who was beaten "for a few minutes" and left on the ground.
Minutes after the attack, Mr. Hershkowitz said a person came into the synagogue to alert them about the man on the ground, which prompted him to call 911.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement that he was sending members of the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to assist in the investigation and "examine all potential motives, including whether the attack may have been motivated by anti-Semitism."
Mr. Specht said additional police patrols would be added throughout the area in response to the incident.
In 2016, the last year figures were available online, eight hate crimes were committed in Rockland County, three of which were reported by the police in Ramapo.
State Senator David Carlucci, whose district includes Ramapo, said in a statement, "This act of violence is horrific and not reflective of our peaceful community."
A $ 10,000 reward is being offered by the Anti-Defamation League in exchange for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the attack. In a statement, Evan R. Bernstein, the New York and New Jersey regional director of the organization, called the attack "truly horrifying."
Mr. Bernstein said that people needed to condemn the attack and "also work as a community to stem the tide of hatred and violence." Michael Gold contributed reporting.

Jesse Wegman: Col. Vindman’s America is something Trump knows little about

Texto completo: As the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry enters its second week of public hearings, a recurring theme has emerged: Veteran government officials, conditioned by years of training to believe that America’s leaders act solely in the best interests of the nation, come to understand only reluctantly what now seems beyond question — that President Donald Trump and his henchmen spent months carrying out a secretive nearly $400 million extortion plot against the new Ukraine government to help him win re-election in 2020.
On Tuesday the part was played by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House’s top Ukraine expert, and Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. Vindman and Williams represent an increasingly endangered species in Trump’s Washington, a world populated by grifters, self-dealers, liars and cheats who look at political power and see personal gain.
In contrast, dedicated public servants like Colonel Vindman and Williams speak in sincere and personal terms of their allegiance to the country and the Constitution they had sworn to defend. Both listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s new president. Both were alarmed by what Trump said.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” Vindman said of his reaction to hearing Trump tell Zelenskiy “to do us a favor, though,” by investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter for alleged corruption.
“Without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel,” the colonel said. “It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.”
Williams, who said she had listened to about a dozen calls between presidents and other world leaders, called the conversation “unusual,” explaining, “I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations, such as former Vice President Biden and his son, struck me as political in nature, given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.”
Republicans tried to dismiss Trump’s call for investigations of the Bidens as a harmless request. Vindman shot that down quickly. “The culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request, it’s to be taken as an order.”
Especially given the power disparity between the United States and Ukraine, Vindman said, it was clear that Zelenskiy wasn’t being given a choice. Slowly it dawned on the colonel that Trump’s true interest was not defending Ukraine against Russian aggression or helping it shake off its long history of official corruption — both long-standing and bipartisan U.S. foreign policy goals.
“It was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security,” he said.
It didn’t help Trump’s case that Kurt Volker, the former top envoy to Ukraine and one of the Republicans’ own witnesses, on Tuesday afternoon dismissed the claims of corruption by the Bidens as conspiracy theories.
Without any substantive defense of the president’s behavior, Republicans did all they could to deflect. They called the hearings a circus. They demanded to know the identity of the whistleblower — even though they previously complained that he had not listened to the July 25 call, and two people who had heard the call were sitting right in front of them. They criticized the media.
They continued to push the idea that Trump is genuinely interested in rooting out corruption. That was never plausible to begin with. But it became even harder to sustain in light of the fact that anti-corruption measures were on a list of talking points prepared for Trump both times he spoke with Zelenskiy, and both times he failed to raise the issue at all. (And as Rep. Eric Swalwell noted, the Pentagon had certified that Ukraine had met its anti-corruption requirements for receiving the military aid before Trump withheld it.)
And Stephen Castor, the staff lawyer for the Republicans, darkly insinuated that Vindman harbored dual loyalties to the United States and Ukraine, because a Ukrainian official had repeatedly offered him the job of secretary of defense. Vindman acknowledged the offers and laughed them off; the Ukrainian official later said he had been joking.
It was a particularly repulsive line of attack in light of Vindman’s opening remarks, in which he addressed his father, who escaped the Soviet Union with his family when the colonel was a young child, in the hope of a better and safer life in America. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth,” Vindman reassured his father. When Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney later asked him why he had said that, he replied: “This is America. This is the country I’ve served and defended. That all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.”
The gallery burst into applause while Republicans sat and stewed. Perhaps they were reflecting on another part of Vindman’s opening statement, in which he said that the testimony he was about to give “would not be tolerated in many places around the world,” specifically Russia. If the exasperated Republicans had their way, it wouldn’t be tolerated here, either.

Parker: Haley's comet just fizzled

Texto completo: and blew it.
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor - and more recently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations - sandblasted her carefully crafted facade and, in a transparent act of virtue signaling, stabbed two of her former colleagues and fellow Cabinet members between the shoulder blades. Her return to the public stage can best be described as a goddess ex machina, whereby she descended from the upper realms to dispense wisdom and hurl thunderbolts into the hearts of any who would deny her.
No one did. Indeed, for the past several days, Haley and her just-released memoir, "With All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace," have been the talk of the town. News shows have homed in on a single allegation that seems to have been designed to produce TV teasers about "shocking revelations" - that Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, and John Kelly, former White House chief of staff and a retired Marine Corps general, had tried to undermine President Trump and asked Haley to help.
More to the political point, Haley essentially launched her next act - possibly as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate (with all due respect to Mike Pence), or as a 2024 presidential candidate. Like clockwork, the president tweeted kudos and encouraged followers to buy the book.
Whatever her ultimate motive, Haley clearly decided that stepping on Tillerson and Kelly was in her political interest. There can have been no other reason to drag these two honorable, accomplished men through the mud for, by her own account, trying to mitigate some of Trump's more-destructive impulses.
Rather than sign on, Haley claims to have been offended by this conspiracy of good intentions. In her book and in several recent television appearances, her halo blindingly bright, Haley has said that Kelly and Tillerson thought they were aiming to "save the country" by attempting end runs around Trump.
They wouldn't have been the only ones, according to last year's anonymous op-ed in the New York Times in which the author similarly claimed that White House staffers and officials have been trying to save the country by working within, sometimes against the president's expressed wishes, which can change in a flash.
The resurfacing of these claims - and the anonymous author's new book - could help explain why good men and women continue to enter this decidedly dysfunctional White House. Being inside the White House may be a better position from which to manage the beast within.
It's a pickle. Do you ignore an immature president and take turns plugging the hole in the dike? (Hey, Haley, we could use some help over here!) Or, do you do everything in your power to avoid actions that might cause the dike to crumble? One thing you don't do, obviously, is confide in an unscrupulous, self-serving, future presidential candidate.
Haley's loyalty to Trump at the expense of Tillerson and Kelly is both a hat-tip to Trump's base and a curtsy to the president. She plainly made a political calculation that people would find "her truth" courageous and that flattery aimed at Trump would not be wasted. "To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing, and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want," Haley intoned during a CBS News interview.
This would be true if said president weren't almost daily threatening to destroy order in the civilized world and didn't behave as though he were checking off the characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. But there's an inherent irony in banking one's future on preaching loyalty through disloyalty. To what end does such a revelation, if true, warrant such tongue-wagging?
Alas, it seems that Haley, whom I've admired since before she became governor, bought her own myth and sold it cheap. Through her preening virtue, she has revealed herself to be more Lucy from "Peanuts" than Erin Brockovich - a cartoonish fussbudget stumping for blue ribbons and bows rather than a whistleblower acting in the service of the greater good.
Sad.

Texto completo: The three-day, family-friendly, annual Bluffton Book Festival is back for another year Thursday through Saturday.
The festival, whose mission is to raise literacy levels in the state and Beaufort County, benefits the Literacy Center of Beaufort County as well as the national Book Industry Charitable Foundation.
A highlight event will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday on Calhoun Street when New York Times bestselling children's author and illustrator James Dean will hold a speaking event for 100 ticketed guests.
Dean will discuss his acclaimed "Pete the Cat" series and introduce his latest installment, "Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party."
The speaking event will be part of the larger street festival planned for Saturday, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., along Calhoun Street between Lawton and Green streets.
The free event will feature author readings and signings, performances, crafts, games, giveaways, food and music.
The festival kicks off with four scheduled workshops between Thursday and Friday at the Lowcountry Presbyterian Church fellowship hall. The workshop schedule is:
* 9-10 a.m. Thursday: Self-editing for publication with award-winning author and editor Susan Diamond Riley.
* 10-11 a.m. Thursday: Navigating pathways to publication with Pat Conroy Literary Center executive director Jonathan Haupt.
* 2-3 p.m. Friday: Writing believable crime fiction with award-winning author and former FBI agent Dana Ridenour.
* 3-4 p.m. Friday :
Ghostwriting 101 with celebrity ghostwriter Vickie MacIntyre.
The Taste of Gullah event scheduled for Thursday evening was canceled, according to the festival's website, which states that those who registered will be refunded.
​There will be a pair of Pat Conroy-inspired lectures at the Bluffton Library from 2-4:30 p.m. Thursday.
The first will be led by Nancy Thode, whose lecture will be about her mother Ann Head. The festival website describes Head as "Beaufort's forgotten novelist and Pat Conroy's creative writing mentor."
In part two, author Bernie Schein will share stories from his newly released memoir, "Pat Conroy: Our Lifelong Friendship."
At 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, Tina Lifford, star of Oprah Winfrey's and Ava DuVernay's critically acclaimed OWN Network show "Queen Sugar," will speak about her time on the show and introduce her soon-to-be-released book "The Little Book of Big Lies."
"Also learn about the area of Louisiana (much like Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island in that it was left to ancestors of slaves), which is the inspiration for the book and television show Queen Sugar," the festival website states.
From 6-9 p.m. Friday, the festival's featured authors will wine and dine with guests at the Masquerade & Mystery Under the Moonlight dinner at Oak Terrace at Rose Hill.
The dinner will feature a three-course meal, a question-and-answer session with authors, and a book-signing period. The event calls for "southern charm attire" or to come dressed as a favorite book character. There will be prizes for the best book character costumes.

Texto completo: VPR.org
BURLINGTON — The future of the Vermont Lake Monsters is in doubt.
According to a New York Times report, the New-York Penn League franchise is one of 42 minor league teams with which Major League Baseball is proposing to sever ties as part of a consolidation of the minor league system. If approved, the change would occur in 2021.
But officials at Vermont’s minor league baseball team are vowing to fight MLB’s efforts to cut ties.
“This is a pretty drastic idea ... one that this industry has never seen before,” said Kyle Bostwick, vice president of the Vermont Lake Monsters. “And we’re a strong franchise that is economically viable. You know, we have strong local ownership with a huge impact on the local community, so it doesn’t make any sense.”
Bostwick said the MLB proposal is not a done deal and could be rejected by the Minor League Ownership Committee.
More than 100 bipartisan U.S. House members, including U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt, have signed a letter urging MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to reconsider the proposal.
In a written statement Tuesday, Welch said the plan would be a “devastating blow” to communities around the country. The congressman added that if the league follows through with the plan, he and his House colleagues will “take a close look at the statutory advantages” for Major League Baseball, which Welch said includes the league’s longstanding exemption from anti-trust laws.
News reports have documented MLB’s concerns about antiquated minor league facilities and the distance between some teams and their parent clubs.
The Lake Monsters fair poorly by both measures: They are 3,000 miles away from the Oakland Athletics, their parent club, and the University of Vermont’s Centennial Field, where they are housed, opened in 1906 — it’s one of the oldest in all of professional baseball.
Many of the teams that would lose their affiliations are from the lower rungs of the minor league system, which the Lake Monsters occupy. They are one of seven teams in the 14-team short-season Single A New York-Penn League reportedly on the chopping block.
Under the reported proposal, the clubs would be invited to join a so-called “Dream League.” Comprised of players who were not drafted or have failed to stick in the major leagues, it would likely represent a lower level of baseball.
The New York Times quoted a minor league official as saying the plan would be a “death sentence” for the clubs.
Losing major league affiliation would diminish the cachet of the Lake Monsters and other teams. More significantly, major league teams currently pay for the players and coaches at affiliated clubs, while the teams themselves cover field, travel and other operational costs.
Under the plan reported in the New York Times, MLB, which currently has 160 affiliated minor league teams, would cut 42 teams and add two more for a total of 120 teams.
MLB argues the consolidation would make player development more efficient and allow clubs to pay the remaining minor leaguers higher salaries. Critics have also said the minor leagues are chock-full of players who have no realistic chance of ever being promoted to the big leagues.

DoorDash Faces Suit Over Tipping Policy

Texto completo: The attorney general of Washington, D.C., is suing food-delivery company DoorDash Inc. for pocketing tips on deliveries, the attorney general's office said Tuesday.
DoorDash previously guaranteed workers a minimum amount for each delivery. When customers electronically added a tip to their total bill, the company put that payment toward the guaranteed minimum the worker receives, rather than increasing the payment by the amount of the tip.
The company "misled customers, who reasonably believed that their tips would go to workers," D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in prepared remarks.
The attorney general is seeking a court order to force DoorDash to surrender the tips and pay civil penalties.
The attorney general's office started investigating the company in March and looked at DoorDash's operations over more than two years up to September 2019.
The attorney general's office said its investigation "confirmed that DoorDash used consumer tips to offset the company's payment to workers" and that while the company encouraged tipping, workers were still paid the same most of the time.
"We strongly disagree with and are disappointed by the action taken today," a DoorDash spokesperson said in an email statement. "We believe the assertions made in the complaint are without merit and we look forward to responding to them through the legal process."
The company's payment structure faced criticism following a July story in the New York Times.
Earlier this year, DoorDash said it would change its tipping policy and that the money its delivery people made in tips would be equivalent to what customers tipped on orders and that their profits would rise on average.

The debate is 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. It is being held in Atlanta and co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post.
There will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer questions from the moderators: Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell and Kristen Welker of NBC and Ashley Parker of The Washington Post. Each candidate will have 45 seconds for rebuttals or follow-ups, as well as a 75-second closing statement.
The New York Times will have extensive debate coverage, including a live analysis throughout the event.
Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate:
How will Warren handle jabs from her rivals?
Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief.
Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance "Medicare for all" beyond the "I'm with Bernie" line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven't stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg -- along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party's moderate wing.
Ms. Warren has shown no indication she's willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word "fight" 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech.
Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date.
The Pete pile-on is coming
For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It's about to boil over Wednesday night.
With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him.
Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would "have to answer" for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a "consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone."
At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend.
In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals -- that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases.
Will Bernie Sanders finally pressure Warren?
While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he'd get it done right away.
"I will engage that struggle on day one of my administration," Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. "Not put it off for several years."
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party's most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders.
Medicare for all who want to debate about it
The Democratic differences on how to fix America's health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same.
In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a "my way or the highway" approach to governance.
Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his "Medicare for all who want it" approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a "public option" and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
A split-screen on impeachment
Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else.
Yet it seems implausible -- if not impossible -- for Wednesday night's debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television.
But what can the candidates say at this point? They're all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy.
Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump's impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail.
So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else.
Can Kamala Harris recover?
Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top.
The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary -- her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing -- but the bump she received quickly faded.
She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus -- she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority -- that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong.
The debate will take place at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta on Wednesday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Ruth Fremson/The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: Since I became The Washington Post's media columnist in 2016, I've developed a habit of asking people, wherever I travel, how they get their news.
In keeping with that, I had a brief chat last weekend in Sarasota, Fla., with a middle-aged man (a local used-car salesman, he said).
'Pretty much just from here,' was how he answered my question, indicating his smartphone. When I dug for specifics, he mentioned Fox News.
The impeachment hearings, which that day had offered riveting testimony from diplomat Marie Yovanovitch? He merely shrugged: Didn't know, didn't care.
That plenty of Americans share this apathy about what's happening in their government is appalling, but hardly shocking.
Many clearly do care, as the movement of public opinion favoring impeachment suggests, but there's a whole category that pollsters and pundits call 'low-information voters.'
The New York Times published a story Monday with this headline: ' 'No one believes anything': Voters Worn Out by a Fog of Political News.' The reporters quoted a Wisconsin woman who said she didn't know what to think of the various conflicting claims she'd heard about President Trump's apparent abuse of power.
'You have to go in and really research it,' she said, and she doubted that many people cared enough to do that.
David Roberts, writing in Vox this week, explored 'tribal epistemology' " the idea that 'what's good for our tribe' has become more important than facts, evidence and documentation. He identifies a crisis that 'involves Americans' growing inability, not just to cooperate, but even to learn and know the same things, to have a shared understanding of reality.'
Roberts, the Times article and Florida Man all point to the same thing: A lot of Americans don't know much and won't exert themselves beyond their echo chambers to find out.
This is the way a democracy self-destructs.
And what's more, it's not that difficult for American citizens to do much, much better.
Granted, the flow of news is unending " exhausting, even. And, granted, there's a lot of disinformation out there.
But apathy " or giving in to confusion " is dangerous.
'I'm terrified that the idea that it is all too much and it is okay to tune out is getting socialized as an acceptable response,' said Dru Menaker, chief operating officer of PEN America, the free-expression advocacy organization.
'Our country is being challenged to its very core, and we have an obligation to pay attention precisely because things are so overwhelming,' she told me by email.
I couldn't agree more. And it's not really all that hard to develop some constructive news habits.
It doesn't take a research project into every claim and counterclaim.
If every American did any two of the following things, the 'who knows?' club could be swiftly disbanded.
Subscribe to a national newspaper and go beyond the headlines into the substance of the main articles; subscribe to your local newspaper and read it thoroughly " in print, if possible; watch the top of 'PBS NewsHour' every night; watch the first 15 minutes of the half-hour broadcast nightly news; tune in to a public-radio news broadcast; do a simple fact-check search when you hear conflicting claims.
For those who can't afford to subscribe to newspapers, almost all public libraries can provide access.
'Whatever the president wants us to believe, there are tested and reliable news sources,' Menaker noted. 'There are even more firsthand sources than ever where you can judge yourself " links to documents, video clips, hours of televised testimony.'
I would also offer this small list of things to stop doing: Stop getting your news and opinions from social media. Stop watching Fox News, especially the prime-time shows, which are increasingly untethered to reality.
If every American gave 30-minutes a day to an earnest and open-minded effort to stay on top of the news, we might actually find our way out of this crisis.
As Walter Shaub, former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, noted Tuesday on Twitter, it was on Nov. 19, 1863, that President Lincoln challenged his fellow citizens to rise to a 'great task.'
Americans must dedicate themselves to ensuring, Lincoln urged in the Gettysburg Address, 'that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.'
So, too, in this historic moment.
After all, authoritarianism loves nothing more than a know-nothing vacuum: people who throw up their hands and say they can't tell facts from lies.
And democracy needs news consumers " let's call them patriotic citizens " who stay informed and act accordingly.
Flag-waving is fine. But truth-seeking is what really matters.

Texto completo: In May 2017, elite marathon runner Shalane Flanagan tweeted a very personal piece of information. In all her years of training and competing against the best in the world, she wrote, she had never missed a menstrual cycle.
Five months later, she won the New York City Marathon.
Flanagan's tweet was startling because many athletes don't even talk to their coaches about their periods -- much less the world. It was also surprising because of the long-held perception that it's normal, even preferable, for women in distance sports to be so lean that they no longer menstruate.
"I just wanted to reinforce to endurance athletes that, 'Yes, here I am. I run 120, 130 miles a week. I don't miss (my period). So it's not normal,'" Flanagan said in a recent interview. "That doesn't mean I'm not trying or training hard enough."
Flanagan recently retired from competitive running and is transitioning to coaching in the elite Nike-sponsored Bowerman Track Club. She'll be one of the few high-level female coaches in the world, and said she plans to talk to athletes about their cycles.
A combination of mostly-male coaching ranks, a lack of sports-science research on women and public silence about the topic have combined to keep athlete menstruation in the background. But those dynamics are changing. Female athletes are speaking about the importance of getting a period and embracing emerging research about how hormonal fluctuations can affect training and performance.
Running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the now-defunct elite training group the Nike Oregon Project, she stopped getting her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight. Nike has said it will investigate Cain's allegations.
Cain told her story in the wake of the four-year ban for doping conduct of her coach, Alberto Salazar. Salazar said he was sorry his frank discussions with athletes about the impact of weight on performance caused hurt feelings but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight.
Dawn Scott, high-performance coach of the U.S. women's soccer team, talked after the team's World Cup victory about using the period-tracking app FitrWoman to help mitigate hormone-related performance shifts among players through nutrition and sleep.
Flanagan co-wrote the cookbook "Run Fast. Eat Slow," focusing on nourishing recipes for athletes, with Elyse Kopecky, who said she got an irregular period for years while a competitive runner in high school and at North Carolina.
Many female endurance athletes struggle with menstrual dysfunction at some point, often because they're not eating enough, said Kathryn Ackerman, medical director of the Female Athlete Program at Boston Children's Hospital.
"There's certainly a lot of resistance to gaining weight because there's no question that being light is an advantage in running," Dr. Ackerman said. "But when they start to get injured, they start to see that there's a delicate balance between getting normal function and being thin enough to feel like they are racing well."
The International Olympic Committee in recent years published consensus statements on a syndrome called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S, from which men also can suffer. The syndrome is fueled by an athlete taking in less food than needed for her level of exercise, which results in inadequate energy to support healthy bodily functions -- including a menstrual cycle.
Most girls begin menstruating between ages 11 and 14, and can lose their periods if their weight or body fat are too low.
A common remedy for athletes who lose their periods has been to put them on hormonal birth control. But that approach masks the problem of underfueling, does not correct the multiple hormonal disruptions that can affect health and sports performance, and does not improve bone density, Dr. Ackerman said.
"The best solution is to get their own cycles," she said.
Menstrual cycles make women more complicated research subjects and historically discouraged medical studies on them, particularly in the area of sports science, said Georgie Bruinvels. She's lead scientist in the FitrWoman program, produced by the Ireland-based sports-science and data analytics company Orreco.
Hormone levels rise and fall during a woman's roughly 28-day menstrual cycle, and researchers only in recent years are figuring out exactly how those changes affect female athlete performance.
In the lead-up to last summer's World Cup, Dr. Bruinvels tracked U.S. women's soccer players' cycles. She made sure they consumed anti-inflammatory foods such as berries before their periods, took in enough iron during their periods and maintained healthy habits throughout the month.
"We know that eating a diet that is high is saturated fat, not eating enough anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich foods, not sleeping well, consuming too much alcohol, smoking and being psychologically stressed can all exacerbate symptoms," Dr. Bruinvels said. "So getting all of those in check is a really powerful way to help you manage symptoms."
Many athletes have flocked to the 2016 book "Roar," about how to match food and fitness to women's physiology. It was co-written by author and athlete Selene Yeager and Stacy Sims, senior research scientist with the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand at Auckland University of Technology.
At a recent TEDx talk, Dr. Sims said silence about periods is among the reasons girls drop out of sports.
In September, U.S. Olympic triathlete Sarah True asked her more than 20,000 Twitter followers: "Random question for female athletes & coaches of female athletes: Do you track menstrual cycles and the effects on performance? Not just menses," she wrote, using a medical word for period. Just over half of respondents said they did.
True said that only in the past year has she started tracking her cycle closely enough to see a pattern.
"My worst training days normally coincide with ovulation," she said. That means feeling sluggish, getting more headaches, having a lower tolerance for heat and performing worse at the highest-intensity exercises.
True said she was relieved to discover that the dip in performance had an explanation. She is 37 years old, and nearly all the coaches in her career have been men. Only with a few of them did she broach the topic of menstruation, she said.
"We've already accepted that high performance, a lot of it is about data," she said. "A potential breakthrough for women's sports is having a highly individualized training program that reflects hormonal fluctuation based on menstrual cycle."

Chick-fil-A Ends Donations To 2 Charities After Criticism

Texto completo: Rights organizations called the decision a positive step but said the fast-food chain should do more.
Chick-fil-A said on Monday that it had stopped making charitable donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, groups that have been widely criticized by advocates for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights.
The fast-food chain, a longtime target of L.G.B.T.Q. rights groups because of its stance on gay marriage, has met resistance in recent months as it has looked to expand in the United States and other countries.
Chick-fil-A had to cancel the opening of a restaurant at the Buffalo airport in March after local politicians objected to it, and it cut short its plans for a British expansion last month when activists organized a boycott of its first outlet there. In September, the grand opening of Chick-fil-A's first international location, in Toronto, was met with protesters who chanted, "Shame!"
Equal rights advocates described Chick-fil-A's decision to stop funding the charities as a positive step but called on the chain to do more.
The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a nonprofit that encourages stronger Christian faith in athletes, requires student leaders to sign a statement banning "any homosexual act." The Salvation Army, a Christian charity, has been accused of discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation. (The Salvation Army maintains that it serves people of all genders and sexual orientations.)
On Monday, Chick-fil-A released a list of organizations to which its foundation has donated this year. The list did not include either organization, even though the groups had received millions of dollars from the foundation over the years.
Chick-fil-A had made "multiyear commitments" to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes that ended in 2018, a company spokeswoman said. Now, she said, the company plans to give to "a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of hunger, homelessness and education."
In an interview with the news website Bisnow, the president of Chick-fil-A, Tim Tassopoulos, appeared to frame the decision as a response to the company's critics.
"As we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are," he said. "There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message."
But Chick-fil-A left open the possibility that it might resume donating to those organizations in the future. "No organization will be excluded from future consideration -- faith based or non-faith based," Mr. Tassopoulos said in a separate statement.
Chick-fil-A has faced widespread criticism from gay rights advocates since 2012, when Dan T. Cathy, the company's chairman and chief executive, was quoted saying Chick-fil-A believed in the "biblical definition of the family unit." Mr. Cathy commented after news reports revealed that the company's foundation had donated millions of dollars to efforts to prevent the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States.
Chick-fil-A ended nearly all its donations to groups opposed to equal rights for people of different sexual orientations in 2012. But since then, it has given money to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Last year, Chick-fil-A gave $ 1.65 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and $ 115,000 to the Salvation Army, according to tax filings.
The Fellowship of Christian Athletes did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Salvation Army said the organization was "saddened to learn that a corporate partner has felt it necessary to divert funding."
"We believe we are the largest provider of poverty relief to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ population," said Alex Yap, the Salvation Army spokeswoman. "When misinformation is perpetuated without fact, our ability to serve those in need, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or any other factor, is at risk."
Advocacy groups said Chick-fil-A should do more to support L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
"While this is an important step for Chick-fil-A, the company still does not have workplace protections and policies that are fully inclusive of L.G.B.T.Q. people," said Beck Bailey, the director of workplace equality at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, an arm of the largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights group in the United States.
Just days after Chick-fil-A's first British restaurant opened in October, the chain said it would close the site in six months amid protests led by a group called Reading Pride.
Martin Cooper, the chief executive of Reading Pride, said Chick-fil-A's decision to stop donating to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes had not changed the group's position.
"It is only a step," he said. "It's not an action that allows us to fully forgive."

Nevada Democrats open to latecomer Deval Patrick if they hear more from him

Texto completo: PARADISE, Nevada — Deval Patrick, a late entrant into the Democratic presidential field, hopes that voters will like him once they get to know him. In Nevada, many voters are open to backing the former Massachusetts governor — if they heard more from him.
“It’s not a fool’s errand,” Patrick told reporters Sunday in Nevada, home to the third 2020 Democratic nominating contest, the Feb. 22 caucuses. “I respect that you are skeptical. And I hope you respect when I prove you wrong.”
In a volatile period for the Democratic primary, with no one candidate a clear front-runner, Patrick, 63, joins lower-tier candidates who insist that current leaders in primary polls will not necessarily be the nominee. About only a third of voters in a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll said they have settled on which candidate to support.
Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Sunday discouraged reporters from writing off candidates, including Patrick, even though there are fewer than 100 days until the Nevada caucuses.
“It's way too early to start crossing people off the list,” Reid said to a Democratic audience in his home state, adding that Patrick is “a very fine man and a great worker in Massachusetts.”
In addition to limited time to build a campaign infrastructure and make upcoming primary debate stages, one of Patrick’s biggest challenges is introducing himself to voters already bombarded by about 1 1/2 dozen candidates still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
It was 10:45 p.m., nearly four hours after the event’s start time, by the time Patrick took the stage at the Nevada Democratic Party’s “First in the West” event Sunday. Speaking order for the 14 presidential candidates participating was determined by polling, and Patrick was the last to speak.''

Hundreds of supporters for other candidates who filled blocks of seats purchased by the campaigns and had turned the event into a spirit rally with organized cheers, “thunder stick” noisemakers, and light-up signs had long cleared the room by the time Patrick spoke.
“It’s a little strange to be in a hall where every candidate but mine has a cheering section already organized,” Patrick joked to the roughly 50 people left in the otherwise empty Bellagio hotel ballroom, promising that he would make his comments brief. “Events like this are fabulous, as good as they are, but I still believe they should end the day they began.”
Patrick argued that he could appeal to a wide range of voters. “If we want to make change that lasts, we have to talk to everybody,” he said. “I am not running to be president of the Democrats; I'm running to be president of the United States.”
Attendees who filtered out before Patrick spoke told the Washington Examiner they had little to no knowledge of Patrick as a candidate. But for those who powered through the entire event, Patrick left a positive impression.
“He stood out, actually. I'd say he stood out of all of them,” said retired Henderson, Nevada, resident Sara Frankel, 64, who is undecided on whom to support in the Nevada caucuses. She also liked South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg but was skeptical that he could win in all areas of the country.
“I didn't have an expectation, and I was really glad I sat there because he would have been missed, and I wouldn't have even known he would have been missed,“ said Jan Kalajian of Henderson, 69, who runs a cleaning company. “You never know who's going to end up on top.”
Some undecided voters who had not heard from Patrick did not discount his candidacy. “I need to know more about him. But I'm going to be actively watching and listening to what he has to say. So it's a possibility," retired Las Vegas resident Kate Baca said at a Joe Biden event on Saturday.
But 72% of likely Nevada caucus-goers in a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday said they are satisfied with their choices in the field, and some voters assessed that Patrick’s campaign might be unable to reach many voters.
“It seems to me that we have lots of good people who've been running for a while and trying to explain their views to the American people. And to be a latecomer, they're going to have to run awfully fast to catch up,” said retired philosophy professor John Knight, who attended an event for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Sunday.
It’s possible that Patrick could get a leg up on other candidates if large donors back an advertising campaign. He declined to discourage outside super PACs from supporting his candidacy, unlike most of the other candidates in the field.
“We need to do some catch-up, so I think we've got to follow and find all sorts of above-board strategies,” Patrick said on Meet the Press Sunday.

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
In Citrus County, Fla., county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: Readers react to Nicholas Kristof's concerns about the dangerous effects of social isolation.
To the Editor:
Re "Let's Wage a War on Loneliness" (column, Nov. 10):
Nicholas Kristof urgently reminds us that these days social isolation is leading, at least in part, to increasing heart disease and death rates. He warns of a "loneliness epidemic," and notes that Britain has taken the lead with the recent appointment of a minister for loneliness. Here in the United States, we seem to be doing nothing about it.
Yet I wonder if the individuals who have committed mass shootings at our schools, temples, bars and Walmarts are also, to a certain degree, a product of this loneliness epidemic. Decades ago the Beatles asked through their song "Eleanor Rigby": "All the lonely people, Where do they all come from? All the lonely people, Where do they all belong?"
Identifying the multiple factors behind the existence of so many lonely people will help us understand that ultimately they belong to all of us. When it comes to the erosion of our society, we're all responsible.
Alejandro Lugo
Las Cruces, N.M.
The writer teaches anthropology at New Mexico State University.
To the Editor:
After describing the serious dangers of loneliness, Nicholas Kristof describes attempts to lessen those dangers. All of those attempts, however, suggest that a lonely person would be less lonely if he or she joined a group of people and participated in a shared event. For some lonely people, however, the idea of participating in a group activity provokes a terrible question: What if they went and felt even more lonely than when they are alone?
Catherine Constantino
New York
To the Editor:
I read with interest Nicholas Kristof's article about loneliness and Britain's treatment of it as a model for the rest of the world. I have to disagree. I am a historian, and my most recent book, "A Biography of Loneliness," explores the modern rise of loneliness in the West.
The word and concept of "loneliness" came into being around 1800 as a direct result of the breakdown of traditional communities and the rise of individualism and consumer capitalism.
Britain's creation of a minister for loneliness is little more than a sound bite. Homelessness and a refugee crisis continue to worsen. Enforced loneliness as a result of need is at its worst ever in Britain.
The problem is that sound bites are effective and deflect attention from the real causes, like the polarizing effects of Brexit and austerity. All around the world, including in the United States, the creation of division acts against the shaping of community.
Don't look to Britain as an example. You can do better.
Fay Bound Alberti
York, England
The writer is a fellow at the University of York.
To the Editor:
The idea for a Secretary of Loneliness has obvious merit, but the title is much too negative. How about Secretary of Friendship, or of Community, or of Human Warmth, Connection and Compassion?
All are in desperately short supply.
Harvey Wasserman
Valley Village, Calif.
To the Editor:
Of course many of us are lonely. I live on a semirural island in Rhode Island. All around us are animals -- birds, turkeys, cows, sheep and goats. In spite of thousands of trees to perch on, and huge meadows for grazing, all of our animals form flocks or herds and spend most of their time within inches of one another.
Not true for the human animals who live here. Although a group of older men meet at a local deli at 4 p.m. every single afternoon, and dozens of volunteers meet often at the local historical society, only at the school are the children and their teachers crowded together for hours at a time, day after day. For the rest, hours and hours are spent alone. A recipe for loneliness, I'd say.

Impeachment probe a tragedy, not a game

Texto completo: On Wednesday the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump took place.
It was a somber moment. The country has not often inched up to this precipice, and for good reason.
The fact that we are here signals that the country got something horribly wrong. It elevated a man of poor character who did not keep faith with the country, but instead did something so egregious and offensive that lawmakers are forced to employ one of the Constitution's greatest powers.
No, this was not a good day. But it was a necessary day.
It is a stress test for the country and its institutions. It will test whether a president with utter contempt for tradition, history, conventions and the rule of law itself can be reprimanded and chastened by the instruments of power as they now exist.
The notion that no one is above the law is being tested.
The thing is that Trump, knowingly or not, has been priming the country for this moment, weakening it for this moment. He has attacked vital institutions like the press. He has corroded the very idea of truth. He has snatched the souls from Republicans in Congress. And he has seeded the courts as much as possible with people who are likely to be more in line with his positions.
This impeachment will test whether the spell Trump cast can indeed be broken.
Setting the bar for success is important here. Ultimate removal from office is an awfully high bar, and it is hard for me to imagine the Senate clearing it. I'm not ruling it out completely. Absolute predictions are dangerous, particularly now.
On the other hand, what I'm most interested in is whether the truth can shine through some of the smoke and mirrors that the president and his enablers have established.
Trump, from the very beginning, has been overwhelming the public with lies and dissembling, while at the same time attacking society's truth-seekers - journalists, investigators and jurists. Republicans in Washington, instead of pushing back and standing on principle, have simply followed suit. God only knows what happened to Lindsey Graham.
And Trump's tactics have been informed and amplified by the misinformation organ that is Fox News and much of conservative talk radio.
At a time of hyper-partisanship, when people treat political parties like sports teams, when it is ever easier to exist in an information silo of like-mindedness, it is now possible to hear information that only affirms you and none that challenges you.
As such, people choosing to live in a Trump/Fox/Limbaugh world are unlikely to be altered by the truth because they are less likely to be exposed to the truth, the fullness of it, the unassailability of it.
But one hopes there are those whose blinders slip. One hopes that there are those somewhere in the middle still in possession of an open mind. One hopes that there are many whose sense of morality is greater than their sense of tribalism.
The bar, then, is whether some of these people reach a point during these hearings where they simply say, "Enough!" And that they do so on the facts and not on the theater of the moment.
Too much of today's political culture, from the delivery of speeches to debate performance to testimony, is caught up in an "America's Got Talent," entertainment-quotient, viral-capacity sensibility. Nothing is genuine; everything is contrived.
But the truth, the cold hard fact, exists on a plane above all that. The truth is not ephemeral or fungible. The truth stands, strong and unyielding.
There was a time in my life when I believed - and thought that most other Americans believed - that the truth was all that mattered. That honesty and bravery were the hallmarks of good character and honorable leadership.
Somehow, somewhere, that got lost, particularly by Republicans in this country. Blind devotion to Trump blinded them to the truth.
On Wednesday, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and the State Department official George Kent testified in direct, unvarnished terms, revealing to the public what they had testified to behind closed doors: that Trump had attempted to extort the president of Ukraine into publicly declaring that he was opening an investigation into the Biden family and the 2016 election.
There is no real room to spin their testimony. They seemed to stick only to what they knew and repeatedly resisted being drawn into the politics of the process. These were career diplomats whose lives have been devoted to serving this country trying once more to defend it.
There was no insinuation, not even from the Republicans questioning them, that they were not being honest and forthright. The only criticism was that some of what they testified to they heard from others.
These men seemed to be telling the truth, and that's the way that it reads.
At some point that has to matter again, even to partisans who don't want to admit that they were wrong, even to those who hate the idea of conceding a victory to their political foes, even to those who get a druglike high out of anyone who can "own the libs."
In the end, this is not a game. This is a tragedy. This is a mourning. This is an awakening. This is the moment where truth has to matter more than all else. That is the bar America has to clear.

Why does national media favor Buttigieg?

Texto completo: Headnote Editorial
We were happy to see former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick enter the presidential race this week - if only to give Americans another strong Black leader to consider.
We were also pleased with the amount of national media attention his announcement got.
But we wonder if it will continue as his campaign continues.
Will he get as much attention as, say, a white mayor from a big town in Indiana?
Presidential contender Amy Klobuchar raised a related question last week on CNN's "State of the Union."
When asked if she thought Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (population: approximately 102,000) and a fellow presidential contender, was qualified, Klobuchar said yes.
But she also noted that Buttigieg is relatively inexperienced. He has not won state races. He has not worked in the Capitol.
"Of the women on the stage, and I'm focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sen. Warren, Sen. Harris and myself... Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don't," Klobuchar said. "Maybe we're held to a different standard."
While we recognize that Buttigieg is unique in that he's one of the youngest presidential candidates in U.S. history and the first openly gay candidate, we share Klobuchar's questions about his credentials and double standards.
There are more women in the field than ever before and - with the exception of Marianne Williamson, who has at least written 13 books - they are all significantly more qualified than Buttigieg. And some of them are unique in their own right.
* Tulsi Gabbard is the first Samoan American and first practicing Hindu elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she has represented Hawaii since 2012. As a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, she is also the first female combat veteran to seek the presidency.
* Kamala Harris is the only Black woman in the U.S. Senate and the only Black woman in the presidential race. She has represented California since 2017.
* Amy Klobuchar is the first woman in Minnesota to be elected to the U.S. Senate, where she has served since 2006.
* Elizabeth Warren, a former law professor, has represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate since 2013.
Only Warren consistently gets the kind of attention Buttigieg gets.
And there are weeks when Harris is mentioned as often in national media as Buttigieg - sometimes more.
There are also more Black and Hispanic candidates in the field than ever before and they, too, are as qualified as Buttigieg - or more so.
* Cory Booker is the first African-American in New Jersey to be elected to the U.S. Senate, where he has served since 2013. Before that, he was the beloved mayor of Newark, New Jersey (population: approximately 285,000).
* Julian Castro became the youngest member of President Barack Obama's Cabinet when he was named secretary of housing and urban development in 2014. Before that, he was the mayor of San Antonio, Texas (population: approximately 1.5 million).
* Wayne Messam was the first Black man to be elected mayor of Miramar, Florida (population: approximately 140,300) in 2015. Before that, he served on the Miramar City Commission for several years. He has the same number of years of experience leading a large town as Buttigieg does. None of them gets the kind of attention Buttigieg gets.
Booker and Castro have publicly struggled to stay in the campaign. On Sept. 21, Booker said he would have to end his campaign if he didn't raise $1.7 million by the end of that month. He succeeded and appeared in the October debate. A few weeks later, on Oct. 21, Castro announced that he needed to raise $800,000 by the end of that month to stay in the campaign. As of Friday, he hadn't met the Democratic National Committee's requirements to appear in the next debate.
And Messam has never appeared on the debate stage.
In a Democratic field with more women and people of color than ever before, many of whom are also unique, why is Buttigieg getting so much attention? And the money and celebrity endorsements that go with it?
We believe a big part of it comes down to the national media.
Members of the national media talk about the candidates who interest them the most or who they think are most likely to win, which brings more awareness to those candidates' campaigns, which helps those candidates raise more money, which gives members of the national media more reason to talk about them.
And members of the national media are mostly non-Hispanic white men.
Approximately 77% of all reporters, editors and photographers are non-Hispanic whites, according to a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center. And approximately 61% of all reporters, editors and photographers are men.
These demographics make newsrooms less diverse than the entire American workforce, which is 65% non-Hispanic white and 53% male.
A significant portion of the newsroom employees at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are graduates of America's elite universities, according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Expertise. Approximately 44% of the Times' newsroom employees and 50% of the Journal's newsroom employees graduated from Ivy League schools. The study did not look at the newsrooms of The Washington Post or The Associated Press.
The demographics of these large newsrooms matter because many newspapers across the country rely on them to provide coverage of these national campaigns.
And who are these predominantly non-Hispanic, white male reporters going to be most interested in?
Another white man.
Would the national media give the same attention to a Black man with the same political experience in a town a little bigger than South Bend (a town most people only knew because of the local university's football team)? We've already seen the answer to that with Messam.
Would the national media give the same attention to a white, Black or Samoan American woman who had never won a state race? We don't know because there are none in the field. But we do know that it's not giving the same attention to some white, Black and Samoan American women who already serve in Congress.
Will the national media give the same attention to a Blackformer governor? Only time will tell.

Texto completo: Watching a child pitch a full-blown tantrum can be a spectacular thing to behold. The flailing limbs and crumpled face, the copious tears and ear-piercing howls.
But imagine if instead of throwing a tantrum, a child expressed extreme agitation by bursting into flames. And what if that child had a twin, and they spontaneously combusted in tandem? That is the premise of Tennessee author Kevin Wilson's engrossing, darkly funny new novel, "Nothing to See Here."
If Anne Tyler ( "The Accidental Tourist") and Chuck Palahniuk ( "Fight Club") had a baby, the result might be Kevin Wilson, who first garnered critical acclaim with his 2011 literary debut, "The Family Fang," a New York Times bestseller that was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman.
Like Palahniuk, Wilson's characters are flawed, edgy, marginalized and borderline misanthropic. But like Tyler, they ultimately redeem themselves by patching together alliances with other assorted misfits to create surrogate families.
In "Nothing to See Here," Lillian is a 28-year-old loner who works a minimum wage job and spends her spare time smoking pot in her mother's attic. But there was a time when she had dreams of escaping her dead-end existence dependent upon a resentful mother and her mother's rotating cast of loser boyfriends.
In her youth, Lillian earned a scholarship to Iron Mountain Girls' Preparatory School. But she was only there long enough to see what the future might have held for her before she was expelled, betrayed by those closest to her and forced to take the fall for someone else's misdeed. The only good thing to come out of the experience was Lillian's unlikely friendship with Madison, her rich and beautiful roommate.
Madison is now married to state Sen. Jasper Roberts, and they have a son "whom she dressed in nautical suits and who looked like an expensive teddy bear that had turned human." When Madison sends Lillian a request for help, Lillian jumps at the opportunity to change her circumstances and to see Madison again after all these years.
Jasper's ex-wife has died and the children from their former marriage, 10-year-old twins Bessie and Roland, are being sent to live with the Roberts in Franklin, Tennessee. Lillian is hired as their full-time caretaker. It's not until Lillian arrives that she learns she and the twins will not be living with the family in their mansion, but in the cottage out back, and that the twins were born with a genetic condition that causes them to burst into flames when they become upset. That last detail is to be guarded with secrecy so it doesn't complicate Jasper's political aspirations.
Lillian is mesmerized the first time she witnesses the children combust. "There were delicate waves of yellow flame moving up and down Bessie's little arms. And then, like a crack of lightning, she burst fully into flames, her body a kind of firework."
Just like parents whose children throw tantrums in public, Lillian goes into crisis mode when Bessie and Roland light up, doing everything she can to keep them calm. A peculiarity of the condition is that the fire doesn't burn the children or even hurt them, but their clothing catches fire and they risk torching their surroundings.
The irony of the situation doesn't escape Lillian. She never liked children or wanted any of her own, and yet here she is, spending her days trying to keep Bessie and Roland safe and entertained just so she can be close to Madison, who is rarely around. But when Madison and Jasper increasingly treat the twins like an unwanted burden that doesn't fit in to their carefully curated lives, Lillian begins to identify with the twins, particularly Bessie, whose defiance burns as brightly as her flames.
"I remembered that feeling, driving down to the valley, no longer welcome at Iron Mountain. It had felt like my life was over. And it kind of was. I wouldn't let that happen to these kids. They were wild, like me. They deserved better, like me."
In the process of protecting the twins -- from their own self-destructive tendencies, as well as whatever nefarious plans the Roberts may be cooking up for them-- Lillian starts to develop feelings for them that confound her. After all, she confesses, "I was no real judge of love, having never experienced it, or even witnessed it a single time in my life."
Tensions begin to mount when Lillian tries to incorporate the twins into the Roberts' lives, just as Jasper's confirmation as secretary of state starts to ramp up. When a surprise twist throws everything into chaos, some painful realities are revealed and everyone goes into damage control in unexpected ways.
It's noteworthy that "Nothing to See Here" is set in 1995, before the dawn of social media, when everything we did wasn't captured on cameras and shared around the world in real time. The concept of keeping secrets still seemed possible back then. Were this story set today, the twins probably would have been trotted out as medical freaks in YouTube videos and ridiculed with memes on Facebook. But in 1995, with Lillian as their caretaker, they get to live in their own little bubble, where they are not only protected from the threat of fire, but they are safe to be their weird, wild selves. And in Wilson's world, that is just as valuable, if not more so, than wealth, beauty and power.

Texto completo: On Nov. 19, Twelve will publish "A Warning" by an anonymous Trump administration official, and I would like to urge everyone to not purchase this book.
For the Americans who would support Donald Trump even if he shot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue, the book is the work of a subversive deep-state operative plotting an internal coup.
For the rest of us who are worried about what additional damage President Trump may do to the office he holds and the country he is supposed to serve, allow me to make a more thorough, reality-based case.
First, this anonymous author's horrifying story of the Trump administration is already leaking ahead of its publication date.
Second, I don't believe in rewarding people who are in positions of significant power and influence who are too cowardly to stand up publicly for the principles they claim to hold.
Let's understand a couple of things: Anonymous is in fact not a deep-state operative. As his or her 2018 New York Times op-ed makes clear, Anonymous is a Republican who supports the president's agenda. Anonymous also is not a "whistleblower." Whistleblowers, as we have seen with the brave individual who flagged the president's attempts to meddle in the integrity of the 2020 election, act out of a sense of duty by going through official, legal channels.
Instead, Anonymous is one of a very common species: a Republican who has worked in the Trump Administration and who believes he is every bit as dangerous to the country as any Democrat, and yet still does not do anything truly substantive to act on those beliefs.
Anonymous is for sure not alone. As Republican consultant Mike Murphy told MSNBC in September, one senator told him that 30 of his colleagues would vote to remove Trump from office if it could be done anonymously.
Gen. James Mattis, former defense secretary, studiously avoids sharing his true thoughts about the president in his new book, "Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead." We know this thanks to Mattis' former aide and speech writer, Guy Snodgrass, who wrote in his own book, "Holding the Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon with Secretary Mattis," about Mattis' concerns regarding the president's behavior.
Mattis says he owes a certain deference to the office of the president to not speak out. It is not clear to me why he should defer to an office when the man holding it shows it no such respect. I understand it even less, considering our national security is in the balance.
I get Anonymous' hesitancy to reveal himself. President Trump is obviously more than willing to use the awesome powers of the presidency to enact revenge on those he perceives as enemies. The Ukraine whistleblower has much to fear. Trump is already using the U.S. Justice Department to try to unmask the identity of Anonymous under the guise of making sure no non-disclosure agreements have been violated.
Unfortunately, by staying undercover, Anonymous significantly blunts any chance of whatever warnings he wishes to issue having an effect, no matter how disturbing. I don't wish any harm to this person. I don't even support any investigatory efforts to have him unmasked without his consent.
That said, is it too much to ask for people who took an oath to the Constitution to live up to their pledge?

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells readers what book to pick up next, based on the last five titles they've read.

1. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power
2. "Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger" by Rebecca Traister
3. "Red Clocks" by Leni Zumas
4. "Circe" by Madeline Miller
5. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner
-- Sally T., Chicago
Jami Attenberg has a special talent for bring a "messy" family to life, and really, what family isn't messy. Sally should try "All This Could be Yours."

1. "She's Come Undone" by Wally Lamb
2. "The Corrections" by Jonathan Franzen
3. "House of Sand and Fog" by Andre Dubus III
4. "An American Marriage" by Tayari Jones
5. "Midwives" by Chris Bohjalian

Going back a bit to find the kind of drama Mary seems to gravitate towards: "The Shipping News" by Annie Proulx.

1. "The Anthologist" by Nicholson Baker
2. "The Best American Short Stories of the Century," edited by John Updike
3. "Nutshell" by Ian McEwan
4. "Motherless Brooklyn" by Jonathan Lethem
5. "Station Eleven" by Emily St. John Mandel
-- Michael T., Chicago
Some good substantive stuff in this list when it comes to contemplating the deepest recesses of the human condition. This makes me think "The Association of Small Bombs" by Karan Mahajan is a good fit for Michael.

Texto completo: November is National Adoption Awareness Month. Journalist, author and adoptee, Seth Berkman, got a taste of his birth country when the New York Times sent him to report on the United Korean women's hockey team. Consisting of players from North and South Korea, select players trained and competed together as teammates at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Berkman's coverage spurred him to write "A Team of Their Own: How an International Sisterhood Made Olympic History" (Hanover Square Press, $19.99).
An edited version of our conversation follows.

Q: How have your trips for work shaped how you travel?
A: Traveling for work has been one of the privileges of my job. In particular, traveling to smaller cities in America is always intriguing. I often find that it's helpful to capture the ethos of a location, to learn about the subject I'm reporting on. Environment can critically shape who we are. I also enjoy going running in new places. I find that's a great way to explore the intricate nooks of somewhere new.

Q: Where have you been to that you'd like to return to explore further?
A: Seoul. I was born in Seoul, then adopted at a very young age. I didn't go back until February 2018 for the Winter Olympics. I was so busy with work duties on that trip and follow-up reporting trips, I feel like I really haven't had a chance to get to know the city where I was born.

Q: What is your favorite vacation destination?
A: Vienna, Austria. I was lucky enough to live in Vienna for a few months on a fellowship and have immensely enjoyed going back. The city is a wonderful combination of old Europe and new style, which can be seen in their abundance of museums.

Q: What untapped destination should people know about?
A: Fukushima city, Japan. In the fall of 2017, I traveled to Fukushima to report on their preparation for hosting events at the 2020 Olympics (in Tokyo). While many parts of Fukushima are still uninhabitable after the 2011 (nuclear) disaster, the city of Fukushima is a great destination. Not only are there numerous onsens (hot springs) and great local restaurants, there is resonance in the sincerity of the residents and their hopes for more tourism and to change the perception that all of Fukushima is a permanently damaged area.

Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?
A: I really like to travel alone, because it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. I have cultivated some memorable friendships with people I've randomly met on the road, who I probably wouldn't have talked to or bothered to spend the time to get to know if I encountered them in New York. The city hardens you in a way that is not conducive to the best of human nature, so it's important to remember to let down my guard when I'm traveling.

Q: What is your best vacation memory?
A: On one of my first days in Seoul in February 2018, I randomly met up with a friend of a friend, who showed me around the city and had me run a lot of errands with her. It was a great way to explore. We ended the night in Itaewon until about five in the morning. She's an Olympic athlete and this was like a week before the Games began, so I'll keep her name confidential.

DEMOCRATIC DEBATE User's Guide: Return to Atlanta shows how debates have changed

Texto completo: BALANCED COVERAGE: WE'RE LISTENING TO YOU
The race for the White House is divisive, and these types of controversial stories receive special attention.
We always try present as much information as possible so that readers can use those facts to reach their own conclusions.
This week, the Democrats are in Atlanta for their fifth debate.So naturally you will find a substantial amount of coverage in the AJC.We will not be ignoring the GOP as its race heats up.
The last time Democratic presidential hopefuls held a major debate in Atlanta was in 1992, when four candidates met at the Carter Center as part of an impromptu series of forums held in three states over 24 hours.
It was taped at noon and held before an invitation-only audience of about 200 in a small auditorium. It lasted but 60 minutes, and one participant, U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, didn't bother to show up: He was beamed in live from satellite, joking to the crowd that he felt "disembodied."
This week's showdown in Atlanta will feel a world apart. It will be a meticulously planned made-for-TV extravaganza that took weeks of preparation to stage and months of lobbying from city and state officials to secure.
All the candidates who are invited -- many others won't meet stiffening qualifications -- will show up with teams of operatives ready to turn their sound bites into carefully crafted moments to boost their campaigns or tear down an opponent.
And unlike 1992, when Democrats dominated every level of politics in Georgia, this week's debate will showcase the party's comeback attempt. Republicans have consolidated power over the past two decades, but Democrats see 2020 as their best chance at a turnaround.
The deal for the debate was sealed with the help of a trio of black women who are among the state party's biggest stars: Stacey Abrams, the 2018 gubernatorial nominee; Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; and state Sen. Nikema Williams, the party's chairwoman.
Then came an intense and symbolic fight over where to hold the debate. Should it be staged in Atlanta's northern suburbs, to highlight the party's newfound success in once-Republican territory? Or in the city itself, long the beating heart of the Democratic electorate in Georgia?
An unconventional spot won out: the Tyler Perry Studios, a $250 million complex built on a former Army base in southwest Atlanta, not far from the airport.
It's the first major film studio that's owned by an African American, and organizers hope it illustrates Atlanta's role as the epicenter of a booming movie business even as some local Republicans mock Democrats for "going Hollywood."
Each of the 12 soundstages at the gleaming 330-acre development is named after a black actor, producer or executive. The debate will be held on one christened for one of the party's biggest names: Oprah Winfrey, the media icon who campaigned for Abrams in 2018.
The candidates - at least 10 have qualified -- will arrive in Atlanta a bit early or leave later in the week just to squeeze in an extra fundraiser, campaign event or face time with local movers and shakers.
They will have more breathing room than the contenders had during the debate in 1992, held just before a series of primary votes that would be a make-or-break moment.
Then-Gov. Zell Miller had orchestrated a shift to move Georgia's primary earlier to March 3, making it the first state in the South to vote, to help resuscitate Bill Clinton's flailing campaign.
It worked: Two days after the Atlanta debate, the Arkansas governor won Georgia, making it his first primary victory of the campaign. Within a week, he racked up victories in Florida, South Carolina and Texas, demonstrating strength across the region.
There's another reason 1992 looms large in the minds of Georgia Democrats. Clinton went on to win Georgia in November on his march to the White House -- the last time a Democrat carried the state in a presidential race.
(Box)
Each of the 12 soundstages at the gleaming 330-acre development is named after a black actor, producer or executive.
HOW THE DEBATE WILL TRY TO BALANCE THE CANDIDATES'SPEAKING TIME
Candidates will each be asked a balanced number of questions, event hosts MSNBC and The Washington Post said.
The debate will be broken up into four segments and will include three commercial breaks.There will be no opening statements.
Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer questions posed to them and 45 seconds for follow-ups at the moderators' discretion. Candidates should be able to respond if they're referred to by name by another candidate, but that will be at the moderators' discretion, the announcement said.
Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds for closing arguments.
The effort to balance out speaking time comes after sizable differences in the amount of time the candidates had to talk at the previous debates.
During the fourth debate in October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden had the most speaking time of the 12 candidates, with Warren logging nearly 23 minutes and Biden a little more than 16 minutes. At the other end was billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who got the least, at just over seven minutes, according to a New York Times review.

But imagine if instead of throwing a tantrum, a child expressed extreme agitation by bursting into flames. And what if that child had a twin, and they spontaneously combusted in tandem? That is the premise of Tennessee author Kevin Wilson's engrossing, darkly funny new novel, "Nothing to See Here."
If Anne Tyler ( "The Accidental Tourist") and Chuck Palahniuk ( "Fight Club") had a baby, the result might be Kevin Wilson, who first garnered critical acclaim with his 2011 literary debut, "The Family Fang," a New York Times bestseller that was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman.
Like Palahniuk, Wilson's characters are flawed, edgy, marginalized and borderline misanthropic. But like Tyler, they ultimately redeem themselves by patching together alliances with other assorted misfits to create surrogate families.
In "Nothing to See Here," Lillian is a 28-year-old loner who works a minimum wage job and spends her spare time smoking pot in her mother's attic. But there was a time when she had dreams of escaping her dead-end existence dependent upon a resentful mother and her mother's rotating cast of loser boyfriends.
In her youth, Lillian earned a scholarship to Iron Mountain Girls' Preparatory School. But she was only there long enough to see what the future might have held for her before she was expelled, betrayed by those closest to her and forced to take the fall for someone else's misdeed. The only good thing to come out of the experience was Lillian's unlikely friendship with Madison, her rich and beautiful roommate.
Madison is now married to state Sen. Jasper Roberts, and they have a son "whom she dressed in nautical suits and who looked like an expensive teddy bear that had turned human." When Madison sends Lillian a request for help, Lillian jumps at the opportunity to change her circumstances and to see Madison again after all these years.
Jasper's ex-wife has died and the children from their former marriage, 10-year-old twins Bessie and Roland, are being sent to live with the Roberts in Franklin, Tennessee. Lillian is hired as their full-time caretaker. It's not until Lillian arrives that she learns she and the twins will not be living with the family in their mansion, but in the cottage out back, and that the twins were born with a genetic condition that causes them to burst into flames when they become upset. That last detail is to be guarded with secrecy so it doesn't complicate Jasper's political aspirations.
Lillian is mesmerized the first time she witnesses the children combust. "There were delicate waves of yellow flame moving up and down Bessie's little arms. And then, like a crack of lightning, she burst fully into flames, her body a kind of firework."
Just like parents whose children throw tantrums in public, Lillian goes into crisis mode when Bessie and Roland light up, doing everything she can to keep them calm. A peculiarity of the condition is that the fire doesn't burn the children or even hurt them, but their clothing catches fire and they risk torching their surroundings.
The irony of the situation doesn't escape Lillian. She never liked children or wanted any of her own, and yet here she is, spending her days trying to keep Bessie and Roland safe and entertained just so she can be close to Madison, who is rarely around. But when Madison and Jasper increasingly treat the twins like an unwanted burden that doesn't fit in to their carefully curated lives, Lillian begins to identify with the twins, particularly Bessie, whose defiance burns as brightly as her flames.
"I remembered that feeling, driving down to the valley, no longer welcome at Iron Mountain. It had felt like my life was over. And it kind of was. I wouldn't let that happen to these kids. They were wild, like me. They deserved better, like me."
In the process of protecting the twins -- from their own self-destructive tendencies, as well as whatever nefarious plans the Roberts may be cooking up for them-- Lillian starts to develop feelings for them that confound her. After all, she confesses, "I was no real judge of love, having never experienced it, or even witnessed it a single time in my life."
Tensions begin to mount when Lillian tries to incorporate the twins into the Roberts' lives, just as Jasper's confirmation as secretary of state starts to ramp up. When a surprise twist throws everything into chaos, some painful realities are revealed and everyone goes into damage control in unexpected ways.
It's noteworthy that "Nothing to See Here" is set in 1995, before the dawn of social media, when everything we did wasn't captured on cameras and shared around the world in real time. The concept of keeping secrets still seemed possible back then. Were this story set today, the twins probably would have been trotted out as medical freaks in YouTube videos and ridiculed with memes on Facebook. But in 1995, with Lillian as their caretaker, they get to live in their own little bubble, where they are not only protected from the threat of fire, but they are safe to be their weird, wild selves. And in Wilson's world, that is just as valuable, if not more so, than wealth, beauty and power.

Texto completo: In the 17th century, they also suspected that the rules of grammar stood between them and a society of equals.
Pronouns are the most political parts of speech. In English, defaulting to the feminine "she/her" when referring to a person of unspecified gender, instead of the masculine "he/him," has long been a way of thumbing one's nose at the patriarchy. ("When a politician votes, she must consider the public mood.")
More recently, trans, nonbinary and genderqueer activists have promoted the use of gender-inclusive pronouns such as the singular "they/their" and "ze/zir" (instead of "he/him" or "she/her"). The logic here is no less political: If individuals -- not grammarians or society at large -- have the right to determine their own gender, shouldn't they get to choose their own pronouns, too?
As with everything political, the use of gender-inclusive pronouns has been subject to controversy. One side argues that not to respect an individual's choice of pronoun can threaten a vulnerable person's basic equality. The other side dismisses this position as an excess of sensitivity, even a demand for Orwellian "newspeak."
Both sides have dug in. To move the conversation forward, I suggest we look backward for an illuminating, if unexpected, perspective on the politics of pronouns. Consider the 17th-century Quakers, who also suspected that the rules of grammar stood between them and a society of equals.
Today the Quakers are remembered mainly for their pacifism and support for abolition. Yet neither of these commitments defined the Quaker movement as it emerged in the 1650s from the chaos of the English Civil War. What set the Quakers apart from other evangelical sects was their rejection of conventional modes of address -- above all, their peculiar use of pronouns.
In early modern England, the rules of civility dictated that an individual of higher authority or social rank was entitled to refer to himself -- and to be referred to by others -- with plural, not singular, pronouns. (A trace of this practice survives today in the "royal 'we."') The ubiquitous "you" that English speakers now use as the second-person singular pronoun was back then the plural, while "thee" and "thou" were the second-person singulars.
When Quakerism emerged, proper behavior still required this status-based differentiation. As one early Quaker explained, if a man of lower status came to speak to a wealthy man, "he must you the rich man, but the rich man will thou him."
Quakers refused to follow this practice. They also refused to doff their hats to those of higher social standing. The Quakers' founder, George Fox, explained that when God sent him forth, "he forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women, without any respect to rich or poor, great or small."
The Quakers thus declared themselves to be, like God, "no respecter of persons." So they thee-ed and thou-ed their fellow human beings without distinction as a form of egalitarian social protest. And like today's proponents of gender-inclusive pronouns, they faced ridicule and persecution as a result.
But there is also an important difference between the Quakers and today's pronoun protesters. While modern activists argue that equality demands displays of equal respect toward others, the Quakers demonstrated conscientious disrespect toward everyone. Theirs was an equality of extreme humility and universally low status. Even the famously tolerant founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, couldn't stand the Quakers and complained of the "familiarity, anger, scorn and contempt" inherent in their use of "thee" and "thou."
Indeed, the trend in pronouns at that time was toward a leveling up, not a leveling down. By the middle of the 17th century, in response to increasing geographic and social mobility, the plural "you" had begun to crowd out the singular "thee" as the standard second-person pronoun, even for those of a lower social station. This meant that everyone would soon become, effectively, entitled -- at least to the honorific second-person plural.
One might expect principled egalitarians like the Quakers to celebrate a linguistic process whereby all social ranks experienced an increase in dignity. But Fox and his followers looked on the universal "you" with horror, as a sign of the sin of pride. Long before he founded Pennsylvania, the Quaker William Penn would argue that when applied to individuals, the plural "you" was a form of idolatry. Other Quakers produced pamphlets citing examples from more than 30 dead and living languages to argue that their use of "thee" and "thou" was grammatically -- as well as theologically and politically -- correct.
The Quaker use of "thee" and "thou" continued as a protest against the sinfulness of English grammar for more than 200 years. (In 1851, in "Moby-Dick," Herman Melville could still marvel at "the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom.") But eventually, in the 20th century, even the Quakers had to admit that their grammatical ship had sailed.
Modern practitioners of pronoun politics can learn a thing or two from the early Quakers. Like today's egalitarians, the Quakers understood that what we say, as well as how we say it, can play a crucial part in creating a more just and equal society. They, too, were sensitive to the humble pronoun's ability to reinforce hierarchies by encoding invidious distinctions into language itself.
Yet unlike the early Quakers, these modern egalitarians want to embrace, rather than resist, pronouns' honorific aspect, and thus to see trans-, nonbinary and genderqueer people as equally entitled to the "title" of their choosing.
To their critics, however, allowing some people to designate their own pronouns and expecting everyone else to oblige feels like a demand for distinction. Yes, some of these critics may be motivated by "transphobic" bigotry. But others genuinely see such demands as special treatment and a violation of equality. They themselves experience "he" and "she" as unchosen designations. Shouldn't everyone, they ask, be equally subject to the laws of grammatical gender?
According to the Quakers, both sides are right: Language reflects, as well as transforms, social realities. But the dual demands of equality and respect aren't always in perfect harmony. Sometimes they are even in conflict. Respect can require treating people unequally, and equality can mean treating everyone with disrespect.
At present, the battle over the third-person singular subject in English seems to be resolving itself in the direction of the singular "they" -- at least when referring to a person of unspecified gender. ("When a politician votes, they must consider the public mood.") Pedants naturally complain. They argue that applying a plural pronoun to a singular subject is simply bad English. But as linguists note, spoken English has been tending that way for many years, long before the issue became politicized.
If the rules of grammar are indeed an obstacle to social justice, then the singular "they" represents a path of least resistance for activists and opponents alike. It may not be the victory that activists want. Still, it goes with the flow of the increasing indifference with which modern English distinguishes subjects on the basis of their social position. More fittingly, if applied to everyone, "they" would complete the leveling-up progress of equal dignity that "you" started centuries ago.
Of course, a 17th-century Quaker would be likely to dismiss the singular "they" as diabolically bad grammar. But hey, who asked them?

Texto completo: You never really know what you are going to need.
Last year I was invited to give a lecture at a college in Vermont. It was to be a quick 36-hour trip -- flight to Burlington, fancy dinner the first night and the lecture and some meetings the next day, then back home to Nashville.
Years ago, I was a light traveler. I had toured Ireland with only a change of clothes and a school backpack. But as I aged, the inner Boy Scout in me gradually took over, and my suitcases grew burdened with things I would almost certainly never need. Who knows, there may be a pool nearby and I would be bereft without my swim goggles. I might actually need both black and brown shoes, right? This time I vowed to return to my roots. No extra stuff. I put on a suit, threw a lightweight backpack over my shoulder and headed for the plane.
What else could I possibly need, I thought, fighting off a hint of anxiety and a faint longing for my swim goggles.
Soon after, I settled into my seat on the plane and we took off. I carefully folded my suit jacket, placed it on the empty seat next to me and began to drift off to sleep. I was jolted awake as a flight attendant walked swiftly past, heading toward the front of the airplane. Soon after came the inevitable announcement asking if there were medical personnel on board.
Two lights came on. Mine and one two rows in front of me, at the seat of a young woman. The flight attendants made it to both of us simultaneously.
"I've got a brain surgeon here," said mine.
"A nurse practitioner here," said the other, perhaps a hint of disappointment in her voice.
All eyes turned to me.
"All hands on deck is my rule," I quickly said to the nurse, who warmly smiled back. We introduced ourselves to one another. I learned that her name was Susan and that she worked in a primary care clinic -- which was excellent news for everyone involved.
We made our way to the back of the half-empty plane. There on the next to last row was a middle-aged man covered in blood. He held a cantaloupe-size wad of tissue under his nose from which blood was pouring out as if a spigot had been opened. He had a deep laceration on the top of his nose but the blood was coming from inside.
I would like to say that I immediately began to assess his medical situation. Instead, my thoughts went to my shirt and suit as the only articles of clothing that I had for the next 36 hours.
I tucked my tie in my shirt. One of the flight attendants handed us latex gloves and I leaned in to pinch the bridge of the man's nose and ask what had happened. He remained silent but the flight attendant spoke up, "He said he hit it on a counter as he bent over to pick up his briefcase this morning."
The man took over: "It had stopped bleeding before I got on the plane but it wasn't coming from the inside until a few minutes ago." I asked him the usual questions about being on aspirin or other blood thinners. Was he a free bleeder or had any problems with bleeding in the past? No, no and no.
Classic first aid teaching says to pinch the cartilage of the bridge of the nose to stop a nosebleed. I did this, but nothing happened. The blood continued to pour out of his nose. I looked to Susan and said, "This may not be so easy." She nodded and began to rifle through her purse.
"He did just have vodka right before it started," the flight attendant volunteered, pointing to the small empty bottle lying on the seat next to him. Susan and I looked at one another knowingly. Alcohol can raise the blood pressure acutely in some people, particularly those with high blood pressure already.
"Do you take blood pressure medicine?" I asked him. "Do you have any on the plane?"
"Yes," he answered, "and no." He turned away, the blood still flowing. Suddenly, I began to piece it all together as a severe disruption of the plexus of blood vessels in the mucosa underneath the bridge of the nose, possibly worsened by elevated blood pressure. I had neurosurgery partners at home who would treat intractable nosebleeds by snaking a tiny microcatheter up from the groin into the arteries of the nose to inject a type of glue directly into the vessels. Invariably, that would stop this type of hemorrhage.
None of that and none of them, however, were with us at 15,000 feet.
"Anyone have any nasal spray?" I asked. "Afrin specifically?" Afrin is basically neosynephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor, and would be ideal to put on a tissue stuffed deeply in the nose.
"And a tampon?" Susan added, holding up a tampon from her purse and smiling. Multiple eyes turned toward her.
"Brilliant," I said, turning to the flight attendant. "Can you make an announcement calling for Afrin nasal spray and a tampon?" Quick enough, the overhead rang out. The man behind us handed up a bottle of Afrin.
"It's used," he said.
"Ooooooo, gross," another passenger added.
I took the bottle and wiped the tip down with what was left of the vodka, trying to make a show of it to all around. I looked up and saw several female hands in the air. Within seconds we had our choice of tampons: small, medium, large, extra-absorbent, all different types were available. There were even some disposable pads, with and without wings.
We settled on medium, extra absorbent. We doused it in Afrin and quickly shoved it up the man's nose as far as we could. By shove I mean that I put my hand behind his head to keep him from pulling away while Susan removed blood-soaked tissue. On the count of three, we put that tampon as far as humanly possible into an orifice entirely different than the one it was designed for.
His bucking during the first insertion was nowhere near as dramatic as it was during the second. By then, he knew what was coming and his eyes widened as we hovered over him a second time and counted. Afterward, to his credit, he calmed down quickly, even mouthing, "thank you" to us and giving a thumbs up.
It was soon evident that this procedure had actually worked. The blood flow had essentially stopped. I did keep up the external pressure, though, switching on and off with Susan the last 30 minutes of the flight. During landing, I stood in the row behind him, pinching his nose from behind. Susan sat next to him monitoring his pulse, calming him. I peered down to see no spattering of blood on my shirt, no bloody tissue sitting on my pants cuff. I breathed a sigh of relief, slightly guilty for being concerned about such a thing.
After landing, the plane went straight to the gate where two emergency medical technicians awaited with a gurney, medical supplies, and a smirk about the "emergency nose bleed." They came on board as soon as the airplane door opened and found the patient in seat 24B with two bloodstained tampons sticking out of both sides of his nose, the strings hanging down toward his shirt. He managed to give another thumbs up to the EMTs and a smile.
As the technicians loaded him up on the gurney, it dawned on me that my proud, newly revisited days of packing light were gone forever. And that a well-placed tampon in an emergency was way more useful on a flight than a pair of swim goggles.

Texto completo: Oh, That Mona Lisa Scowl
The Louvre attracted 10 million visitors in 2018, the overwhelming majority of whom were there to see -- and be seen with -- Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Jason Farago, an art critic for The New York Times, made the case in a recent article that the painting he calls "the Kim Kardashian of 16th-century Italian portraiture" should be removed for the greater good of the museumgoing experience. Here are some of the passionate reader responses that followed, edited.
I, personally, am sick of hearing people complain about the crowds in front of the Mona Lisa. Yes, they are bad. But no, they are not THAT bad. You can still see the painting just fine if you take your time. The crowds are nothing compared to what the average New Yorker goes through during their daily commute. The painting is a masterpiece. Not only for its artistic merits but also for the mystique surrounding it. It was unconventional for its time. Portraits of women always showed them sitting upright, covered in jewels, dripping in formality. Da Vinci was one of the first to capture a woman relaxed, in simple clothes, giving a genuine expression. DANIEL METZ, BROOKLYN
Comparing the Mona Lisa to Kim Kardashian is a sacrilege. She was a lady, not a California celebrity. MARTHA WATKINS, GENEVA
Over the past 40 years, I have visited the Louvre four times. The first three visits were very satisfying and of course included a viewing of the Mona Lisa. I was able to stay as long as I wished and could even get close enough to inspect the painting as much as my untutored eye could absorb. My last visit to the Mona Lisa, in the spring of 2011, was a terrible experience The photograph of the horde of selfie-takers massed 20 feet deep in front of the painting replicates my experience. Flashes from cellphones and the noise of the milling crowd destroyed the serenity of the portrait, and museum guards did not intervene, possibly because it would have been pointless. The crowd paused, shot a picture and then swarmed on; it is behavior one associates with tourists who simply need to show they were there but who do not desire any deeper connection to the event. There are postcards, posters and books in the Louvre's gift shop that provide much superior mementos. Let them go there and leave the actual picture to those who want a few quiet moments to imagine. JUDITH KLEIST, HAVERTOWN, PA.
Hordes of tourists are literally canceling the world's treasures. Perhaps it's time for all of us to stay put, and instead enjoy our immediate surroundings, say, for a decade. The planet and the locals would be grateful. ALFONSO PAREDES, BROOKLYN
I'd rather explore all the other museums in Paris than fight though the lineup which is there primarily to check off the Mona Lisa box on their Paris stamp card. In fact, I'd pay double for a "no Mona Lisa" entry to the Louvre to avoid the lineup and crowds, but since one doesn't exist, I spent my month in Paris this summer visiting a long list of other fantastic museums and galleries. PAUL DONE, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA
The problem is not about selfies or photography. It's about selling celebrity and the significant increase in tourism. Anyone who has traveled over the past few decades has experienced insane hordes of tourists packing a few prominent venues where, motivated by tour guides carrying little umbrellas, they worship at a couple of shrines, like Mona, or Venus, or David. TOBI GORDON, TORONTO
As a museum professional, I'm surprised by the many comments wanting to ban cameras. This has largely been seen within the field as a democratization of art. Many people are not able to get to museums, or pay the expensive admission fees, but by spreading images online, the art is available to all. NICOLE BLOOMFIELD, HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y

Texto completo: Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts " now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments " to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination.
'Our thinking is that the general election has already begun,' said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, adds to those of several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns.
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign this week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, Acronym, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months.
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised less than $75-million through the first three quarters of the year. former vice president Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38-million in the same nine months.
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared with $5.45 million by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3-million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89 percent of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or buy campaign gear.
'Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s,' Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by the New York Times.
A pro-Trump independent effort, the America First Action super PAC and an affiliated group, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: 'A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security.'
The digital campaign began Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
'If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg.
Bloomberg, one of the world's richest men, has taken several steps to prepare for a bid for the Democratic nomination, including filing paperwork in states with early deadlines to get on the ballot. He has also been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans.
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president. At the time, he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination' and would instead focus on spending his money in an effort to hurt Trump's chances in swing states.
But he and his advisers have since concluded that there is a possible route to the nomination because of lingering divisions in the field and the vulnerabilities of the top-polling candidates.
The decision to reconsider signals, among other things, a public rebuke of Biden's performance so far. The former vice president has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.

Indiana judges suspended after brawl in White Castle parking lot

Texto completo: The judges’ plan, if there ever was one, was to enjoy a couple of drinks with their colleagues the night before a judicial conference in Indianapolis.
But by 3 the next morning, three Indiana circuit court judges, by way of a failed attempt to enter a strip club, were brawling with two strangers outside a White Castle in a drunken melee that ended with two of the judges shot and in critical condition in a hospital.
In the latest repercussion from that night, the judges, Andrew Adams, Bradley B. Jacobs and Sabrina R. Bell, were this week suspended from the bench by the Indiana Supreme Court for having “gravely undermined public trust in the dignity and decency of Indiana’s judiciary.”
According to police reports and the opinion issued by the Supreme Court, the drinking began early in the evening of April 30 for Jacobs, who had a scotch in the hotel lobby after checking into his room for the conference. At 7 p.m., Bell kicked things off with a couple of Seagram’s Escapes. Sometime after 10 p.m., Adams started drinking beers at an Irish pub. Around 12:30 a.m., all three were drinking with a court magistrate at another bar, throwing darts and playing cornhole.
About 3 a.m. they headed for the strip club, which had just closed for the night. The four officers of the court then walked to a nearby White Castle. The magistrate went inside while the three judges waited in the parking lot.
At that time, two men, Alfredo Vazquez and Brandon Kaiser, drove by in a blue SUV and “shouted something out the window,” according to the Supreme Court opinion. With no gavel to register her displeasure, Bell extended her middle finger instead.
The two men objected, and after they parked their vehicle in the White Castle parking lot, a “heated verbal altercation ensued” — with all parties yelling, using profanity and making “dismissive, mocking, or insolent gestures.”
The dispute quickly escalated into a brawl — at one point Adams kicked Kaiser in the back — but it appeared to have ended when Jacobs had Kaiser pinned down, with his fist raised to strike.
“This is over,” Jacobs said, according to the opinion. “Tell me this is over.”
If only it was: Kaiser pulled out a firearm, shooting Adams once and Jacobs twice, according to the police.
Adams needed two emergency operations, including to repair damage to his colon. Jacobs, who was shot twice in the chest, had two operations during a 14-day hospitalization.
Medical workers also recorded the men’s blood alcohol levels: 0.13 for Jacobs, and 0.157 for Adams. (The legal limit for drivers in Indiana is 0.08.) The report says Bell did not have her blood alcohol level tested, though she later said she had no memory of what would seem to have been a memorable encounter.
“I mean I fully acknowledge that I drink and get mouthy, and I’m fiery and I’m feisty,” Bell said in a recorded statement made at a police station after the brawl. “But if I would have ever thought for a second that they were gonna fight or that that guy had a gun on him, I would never, never. . . .”
The report does not indicate how Bell finished that thought, but it does detail the punishments adjudicated to the three justices.
Adams, a Democrat elected to the Clark County court in 2014, was charged with felony battery and multiple misdemeanors; he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for kicking Kaiser, and was sentenced to a year in jail with all but two days suspended. He was also suspended from his job without pay for 60 days.
Though a grand jury declined to indict Jacobs, a Republican who has also been on the Clark County court for five years, the Indiana Supreme Court suspended him for 30 days without pay. Bell received an identical suspension.
Kaiser, who is accused of firing on the judges, faces eight felony and six misdemeanor charges in a jury trial set to begin on Jan. 13. His lawyer declined to comment on Friday.
Court records show that Vazquez pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor battery charge, and received a yearlong sentence that was mostly suspended. His lawyer could not be reached.
A lawyer representing Jacobs released a statement on Friday saying, “Judge Jacobs acknowledged that his behavior that evening, although not illegal, was unbecoming of a judge and that his actions were injudicious and reflected poorly upon him and his peers on the bench.” A lawyer for Adams declined to comment, though the judge has previously released a statement expressing regret for his actions. Bell, a Republican who began her tenure in Crawford County in 2017, represented herself in the disciplinary proceedings. On Friday, she declined to comment on the case.
As circuit judges, they hear all kinds of cases — small claims, felonies, misdemeanors — though Jacobs’ office said about 90% of the cases his court hears are drug-related.
In its opinion, the Indiana Supreme Court said that the three judges’ behavior “fell far short” of their code of conduct, which directs them to “aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence.”

Empathy is good, but what if you care too much?

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload.
Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Declarations: Republicans and 'Anonymous' Get It Wrong

Texto completo: A young foreign-affairs professional asked last week if the coming impeachment didn't feel like Watergate. He was a child during that scandal, I in college. I said no, Watergate had the feeling of real drama, it was a reckoning with who we were as a people; it felt grave. This is more like the Clinton impeachment, grubby and small.
But watching the first day of hearings I thought that wasn't quite right. There was something grave in it, and a kind of reckoning. This was due to the dignity and professionalism of the career diplomats who calmly and methodically told what they had seen and experienced. They were believable. It didn't feel embarrassing to have faith in them.
Republicans on the panel didn't know what to do. They know what this story is, and I believe they absolutely know the president muscled an ally, holding public money over its head to get a personal political favor. But they're his party, they didn't want to look weak, they had to show the base they had his back. In their interruptions and chaos-strewing they attempted to do some of what the Democrats did during the Kavanaugh hearings, only without the screaming meemies of Code Pink.
The Democrats were disciplined in their questioning and not bullying and theatrical, which was a surprise and unusual for them.
But the juxtaposition of the witnesses, the men of America's diplomatic class, with the sullen, squirrelly, off-point Republicans, was what gave the hearing shape.
William B. Taylor Jr., acting ambassador to Ukraine, 72, was fifth in his class of 800 at West Point, where he was cadet battalion commander. Bronze Star, Vietnam, 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne, 506th Infantry, Second Cavalry. After that, government work and diplomacy. He's known for his modesty. You couldn't be more impressive. Testifying along with him George P. Kent, younger and a different sort -- studied Russian history and literature at Harvard and Johns Hopkins, speaks Ukrainian and Russian, 27 years in the foreign service.
They seemed to have capability and integrity. They weren't deep state; they were old school, old style, not some big dope of a political donor, as all administrations have among their ambassadors, but the people who make it work, who maintain the standards, who keep it all up and running.
This is what I saw: the old America reasserting itself, under subpoena. They were American diplomats, with stature and command of their subject matter.
And the world was seeing it, and maybe thinking, "I remember them." Older prime ministers and presidents in foreign capitals could be thinking, "I remember those pros, the bland Midwestern tough guys who knew their stuff. Good that they still exist."
Quietly, smoothly, brick by brick, they gave their testimony and painted a picture that supports the charge that yes, Donald Trump muscled Ukraine.
To the week's other attempt to make a case against the president:
I don't like to beat up books, because they're books; you can't have enough data and argumentation and art; if you don't like it, don't read it. But "A Warning," the White House insider expose by "Anonymous," is a poor piece of work, and something false at its heart shows a deep disrespect for the reader.
What we especially need in the political world now is guts, brains and sincerity. Anonymous does not offer them.
There's nothing here that hasn't already been said in a dozen books and a thousand articles. There is little first-person testimony telling us what the author saw, what was said, what happened, what it meant.
Halfway through I realized: Anonymous isn't really hiding his identity, he's hiding the major fact of that identity, which is that he is not a significant figure. The premise of the original article in the New York Times, of which this book is an expansion, was that he was a major player -- a "senior official of the Trump administration" -- who's giving you what history needs, eyewitness testimony. But you get the impression the author wasn't actually in the room where it happened, or not often. Not having new, first-person information he relies on high-class padding (thoughts on Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, the role of Congress) and style. The style is midlevel ad agency, clean but with no ballast. It is by the end irritating -- shallow yet haughty, common yet pretentious, and full of cliches. His Trump "takes no prisoners" and "behind closed doors" damages "the fabric of our republic." The president is historically and politically uninformed, inattentive in briefings, vengeful and dangerous, gets harebrained ideas, and says stupid things. Yes, we know. But you have to do more than assert.
Anonymous suggests he can't be specific because it would blow his cover. But without specificity the work becomes contentless and devolves into mere rhetoric and polemic. And why not be specific and let people know who you are? It would make the truths you feel demand urgent expression more credible and concrete. There's nothing dishonorable about thinking you are witnessing a catastrophe and telling the American people. But you have to look history in the face and take its punishments.
And in this case what punishments, anyway? You'll be fired? You hate where you work! You'll be insulted in tweets? So what? There are two Trump tweet lists in America, one with the names of those who've been attacked and the other with those who haven't. The first is longer, and they're still alive.
It is all so disguised, self-valorous and creepy.
Why was Anonymous there? He doesn't really say. Since he saw the emptiness and danger early on, why didn't he leave? "God knows," he says, "it would have been easy." He says he stayed because Mr. Trump is "a mess" and he wanted to help. But he gives no examples of how he helped. The fact is it's hard to leave a White House. You're unemployed, your office is gone, your old colleagues cool on you, and the neighbors are no longer impressed. Better to stay and simmer.
He claims "senior advisors and cabinet-level officials pondered a mass resignation, a 'midnight self-massacre'" to draw the public's attention to the White House disarray. But they didn't go through with it. Why? "It would shake public confidence." But diminishing public confidence in the administration was the point, no?
He refers to sensitive conversations that have not been declassified and vows not to speak of them -- "such details have been omitted." But it's hard not to suspect he didn't "omit" them, he didn't know them.
"Trump wanted to use a domestic presidential power to do something absurd overseas, which for security reasons I cannot disclose." Oh come on.
This book is as edifying as Omarosa's White House memoir, but without the leavening air of insanity.
At one point Anonymous reports that at a Group of Seven meeting Trump threw some Starburst candies at Angela Merkel and said: "Here, Angela. Don't say I never gave you anything." I'd never heard that. That's news! But I Googled the quote and there it was, rows of citations attributing the anecdote to Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group.
My only advice to Anonymous is for the good of your reputation, stay that way. And if you feel such heavy daily repugnance, leave already.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Has a U.S. College Given Russia Too Friendly a Platform?" (Arts pages, Nov. 9):
The amount of Russophobia in the American media has been unprecedented in recent years. While anti-Russian rhetoric is used for internal political struggles in the United States from time to time, this propaganda campaign has reached absurd levels, spilling over into areas that have little to do with politics.
Russian culture is portrayed as a powerful tool of the Kremlin to manipulate American public opinion and burnish the image of Russia. The allegations have been substantiated by zero evidence.
Our countries can develop stereotype-free perceptions of each other only through frequent and authentic cultural exchanges, and most important, by shaping the common values that are necessary for ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the entire world.
Russia and the United States, as the largest nuclear powers and permanent members of the Security Council, bear a special responsibility for this. The mutual isolation that has gripped politics and economic issues should not affect our cultural relations.
It is important to stop seeking political expediency and consider both countries' long-term interests. Everyone benefits from greater cultural understanding between our two countries now and far into the future.

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — US Representative David Cicilline said Friday his proposal to create a regional economic development commission for Rhode Island, Southeastern Massachusetts, and parts of Connecticut could bring an infusion of federal funds to the area with few restrictions on how the money could be spent.
Cicilline, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, and several other Democratic lawmakers are seeking to create the Southern New England Regional Commission, a federal-state partnership that could obtain significant federal aid in order to enhance infrastructure and transportation projects in the region.
Cicilline said he's particularly interested in supporting renewable energy projects, the maritime economy, and boat and ship building, but he said final decisions would be made by the governors of the three states.
“We don't have earmarks specifically anymore," Cicilline said. “I think, in a lot of ways, these regional commissions have been a creative way to brings funds to states that comes with flexibility" in the ways the money can be used.
Under federal law, regional commissions must include a cochairperson appointed by the president and members include the governors of every state involved in the program. The commissions typically have an executive director and other administrative staff, with costs split between the states.
In 2008, during the Great Recession, the Northern Border Regional Commission was established to support economically distressed communities in northern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. The commission issued more than $11 million in grants in 2018, according to its annual report.
Some of the projects funded by the Northern Border Regional Commission last year were a food processing and testing facility for the production of mouse food formulas in one Maine community; improved workforce training at a community college in New Hampshire; a sewer line expansion in New York; and a new career academy at a high school in Vermont.
If Congress agrees to create the commission, Cicilline said he doesn't expect funds to be set aside for improved train service between Providence and Boston, in part because Boston would not be included within the communities the commission would serve.
Instead, Cicilline said he'd like fund to benefit communities such as New Bedford and Fall River, and all of Rhode Island. He said improving bridges or transportation between Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island might be considered.
In a statement, Kennedy, who represents Southeastern Massachusetts, said “invisible borders" have too often forced “competition between friends that ultimately denies partners the opportunity to unify in pursuit of shared interests, federal investments and economic growth."
“By creating this regional commission, we can unite the strengths of our region and build a better future that cannot be restrained by state borders," he said.
While there is no guarantee the commission will win congressional approval, Cicilline and Kennedy found an influential cosponsor before the bill was introduced.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who signed on to support the commission, has said she plans to run to be chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee after New York Representative Nita Lowey retires next year. Democrats would also need to maintain control of the House for DeLauro to have a chance to oversee the committee.
“The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to keep up with rising costs," DeLauro said in a statement. “To address this problem, our federal government must work hand-in-hand with state and local authorities, and that is exactly what this bill would set in motion."

Texto completo: Unlike several of his peers in the ranks of great American filmmakers, such as John Ford and George Stevens, Stanley Kubrick never wore a uniform in service to his country. "I slipped through the cracks each time," said Kubrick, who was born in 1928, in an interview with film critic Gene Siskel in 1987. "I was 17 when World War II ended and was married when the Korean war began."
Yet the filmmaker's civilian status did not discourage him from considering war as a subject throughout his career. Among his first four films, two were stirring antiwar jeremiads: his debut, "Fear and Desire" (1953), and the powerfully poetic "Paths of Glory" (1957). By 1987, when he made his Vietnam War drama "Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick had shifted from the spirited outrage of those early efforts to a more nuanced view accounting for the thrill of battle. "'Full Metal Jacket' suggests that there is more to say about war than it is just bad," Kubrick told Siskel.
Fifty-five years ago, however, Kubrick decided that the most pertinent thing to say about war was that it could be funny—very, very funny. In 1964, Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," which comically repurposed the basic scenario of Peter George's 1958 novel "Red Alert."
With a cast of characters including googly-eyed military officials, feeble politicos and a gluttonous Russian ambassador, "Dr. Strangelove" surely carries the patina of the Cold War, but its scorching satire, in which all sides of the debate are sent up, remains as perennially invigorating as Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal."
Co-scripted by Kubrick, George and Terry Southern, the film unbalances the viewer from the first scene at Burpelson Air Force Base, where Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), in an effort to advance his anti-Communist agenda, has single-handedly set into motion a nuclear strike against the U.S.S.R. Most comedies would present the certifiably cuckoo Gen. Ripper as an outlier, but Kubrick doesn't find too much virtue—or even common sense—in the characters who surround him, including several played by Peter Sellers.
One of Sellers's characters is relatively sympathetic—Royal Air Force Capt. Lionel Mandrake, who fruitlessly endeavors to bring Gen. Ripper back from the brink—but beyond that, the actor was asked to represent the extremes of nuclear-age cluelessness and recklessness.
As President Merkin Muffley, Sellers effortlessly embodies the soft-headed squareness of a generation of left-of-center politicians. Muffley—whose bald-headed, professorial appearance and singsong, schoolmarmish manner are surely meant to recall Democratic presidential contender Adlai Stevenson—makes futile appeals to reason and order in dealing with the crisis. "Gentlemen, you can't fight in here—this is the War Room," he says as he tries to settle the squabbles of his advisers, including Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), a red-blooded chewing-gum fan who carries with him a binder outrageously labeled: "World Targets in Megadeaths."
Meanwhile, as the inconsistently wheelchair-bound title character, Sellers brings to life a scientist even madder than Gen. Ripper in his suggestion that the pending global cataclysm—unstoppable when it's revealed that the U.S.S.R.'s counterattack is automatic—might not be all bad for the survivors who cluster in mine shafts.
In its equitable distribution of satirical targets, the film proved popular in unlikely quarters—including with military brass. In Peter Bogdanovich's 1999 New York Times oral history of Kubrick, John Milius recalled that Kubrick had been approached by higher-ups at the Strategic Air Command after the film was released. "He was afraid they'd be angry with him—that they would do something to him," Milius said. "I said, 'Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They wanted to honor you. They loved "Dr. Strangelove."'"
Indeed, Kubrick places a pox on the houses of both the hawks and the doves. Each group founders in failing to halt Gen. Ripper, whose rise to power serves as the sober warning at the heart of the film. As Kubrick said in an interview with Playboy in 1968, "The serious threat remains that a psychotic figure somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war." Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor gives the film a subtle, sometimes documentary-like camera style that belies the jokey character names and one-liners; the film looks authentic even when the story turns preposterous or apocalyptic.
Following the failure to fully nullify the general's order, the final scene presents a wave of presumably earth-annihilating nuclear explosions against Vera Lynn singing "We'll Meet Again." Yet, in declining to back down from the darkest implications of its plot, "Dr. Strangelove" today seems sharper and less mawkish than such earnest antinuclear films as "On the Beach" (1959) and "Fail-Safe" (1964).
Kubrick believed he was doing humanity a service in making a comedy that wraps up with the world as we know it blasted and burned. Speaking with Playboy, the director reflected: "A recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it—nor a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing it."
Mr. Tonguette's book on Peter Bogdanovich will be published next year by the University Press of Kentucky.

Texto completo: By the time she was 4 years old, Marielle Heller had already rejected "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." As the eldest of three, she saw her younger siblings watching the PBS show and felt she had grown "too jaded and cynical" for Fred Rogers' brand of cheery positivity.
It wasn't until decades later, when she became a parent herself, that the filmmaker gave Rogers another shot. When her son turned 2, the first television program she and her husband allowed him to watch was "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood." The animated kids series, which launched in 2012, is produced by Fred Rogers Productions and espouses many of the same values as the original Rogers show - teaching children how to deal with difficult emotions like anger, disappointment and loss.
"It's like the parenting hack of all parenting hacks," Heller said. "It makes you a better parent, I swear to God, because it gives you, like, tips on how to deal with your children. And there's an episode for everything. When you're potty training, there's an episode that we all have sung and quoted a bajillion times that's, like, 'When you need to go potty, stop and go right away! Flush and wash and be on your way.' "
Heller was steeped in the world of Daniel Tiger when the screenplay for "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" came across her desk a couple of years ago. She'd worked with the writers of the script, Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, on Amazon's "Transparent," and they'd mentioned they were trying to get a film made about Mister Rogers. At the time, however, the movie already had a director attached, but Heller nonetheless asked: "Why am I not directing that?
"I said something very bold like that because it felt so up my alley, being a mom with a little kid," Heller recalled with a laugh.
By the time she was offered the directing gig on "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" - which Sony Pictures will release on Nov. 22 - Heller had been anointed one of Hollywood's top directors to watch. She made her directorial debut in 2015 with the critical darling "The Diary of a Teenage Girl," about a 15-year-old's sexual awakening. Heller's follow-up, last year's "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" was even better received. The film, which earned star Melissa McCarthy an Academy Award nomination, told the story of an author who forged letters by famous artists to make ends meet.
And - to the surprise of the producers on the Rogers film - she had also formed a relationship with the actor most coveted for the lead role: Tom Hanks. Coming off a period in which he'd played a handful of iconic real-life figures, including Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger and Walt Disney, Hanks had already passed on the "Neighborhood" script three times.
Heller had become friendly with the actor after meeting him at a backyard birthday party held by his son, Colin Hanks. During the gathering, Tom Hanks mentioned he'd just read an article in The New York Times about female directors. Heller pointed out she'd been quoted in the piece. Upon learning more about her, Hanks promised to watch "The Diary of a Teenage Girl." He made good on his word and set up a meeting with the filmmaker, telling her, "We gotta find a way to work together."
For years, Heller said, she and the actor would stay in touch, sending potential projects to each other. So when the team behind the Rogers film expressed how badly they wanted Hanks for their movie, Heller said she'd give it her best shot.
"So I called him and I described how I saw the movie - that I didn't want it to be a biopic," she remembered. "It was never going to be a prosthetics thing - it wasn't going to be about trying to make him look just like (Rogers). It was really a character piece about manhood and what it is to be a good person. And he was like, 'Oh, OK, lemme go read the script with all of that in mind,' and signed on like a week later."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" is far from a Rogers biopic. In fact, Hanks plays the supporting character in the film, which stars Matthew Rhys as an Esquire journalist tasked with profiling the TV legend. Based on Tom Junod's 1998 magazine article about Rogers, the movie explores the effect the star had had on the writer, revealing less about himself in interviews than expressing a genuine interest in the journalist himself.
Shortly after the movie was greenlit, Morgan Neville's hit documentary about Rogers, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" was released in theaters. The movie collected $22.8 million in theaters, making it a huge box office success for a nonfiction film. At first, Heller admitted, "We had a moment where we kind of were, like, 'Oh, is this a good thing or a bad thing?' And then we thought, 'Oh, more Fred Rogers in the world? This is a good thing."
Before filming began, Heller visited Pittsburgh, where Rogers lived and worked for nearly his entire life. She visited the Fred Rogers Co., meeting with executives who'd worked there for nearly four decades and had been integral to the PBS show. She went to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Rogers' hometown, where his archives are housed, sifting through the boxes of letters, photographs and emails he'd meticulously stored until his death in 2003.
She also met with Rogers' widow, 91-year-old Joanne Rogers, who lent her late husband's ties to the production and frequently visited the set during shooting.
What Hanks said he admired about Heller's approach to conveying Rogers' beliefs was that she made it a "slow-cooking recipe" without "fakery or trickery," allowing the character to express his identity through his actions instead of words.
Rogers "was not introduced as: here's the most important man there is," the actor explained. "She captured who he was without trying to explain it. She showed it through his behavior and the behavior of others when they were around him."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.
Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON - Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.
Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA - Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.
Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK - Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.
US implores EU nations to retake fighters from IS group
WASHINGTON - European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.
In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Netflix Keeps Its Focus on New Programming as Rivalry Heats Up

Texto completo: Netflix Inc. Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said "nothing has changed" with the launch of Walt Disney Co.'s new streaming service, expressing optimism that his company is prepared to weather competition from rivals because of its investments in original programming.
"We don't really get that distracted by competition," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday at an event in New York.
Disney this week launched its $6.99-a-month Disney+ service, which features programming from its Star Wars and Marvel brands and a deep catalog of animated films and original programs, among other fare.
Apple Inc. this month launched its own services and next year AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. will join the fray.
Mr. Sarandos said with most of the major Hollywood players emerging as competitors, it is unlikely they will want to keep offering programming to Netflix.
He said he envisions a world where Netflix will have to rely solely on its own content, which is why the company has invested so aggressively in originals.
"We figured at some point everybody would get into this," Mr. Sarandos said. "I was frankly surprised it took Disney and other people this long to go on this path."
Disney said Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups on its first day of service. The company didn't say how many of those people received free service through a partnership with mobile provider Verizon Communications Inc., and Wall Street will be waiting to see how many users stick with Disney+ when free trials end.
Disney, which had been one of Netflix's biggest suppliers of original and library content, has indicated it will no longer sell shows to Netflix, instead focusing on Disney+ and Hulu, which it also controls.
Mr. Sarandos also clarified recent comments that Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings had made about the company's decision to take down an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show "Patriot Act" from the streamer's Saudi Arabia service after that government's complaint.
Asked about that decision at a New York Times conference last week, Mr. Hastings said the company is "not in the truth to power business, we're in the entertainment business."
"All entertainment is truth to power," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday, adding that Mr. Hastings was trying to say Netflix isn't "in the breaking news business."

Political Attack Reported On State Dept. Employee

Texto completo: An internal investigation detailed a smear campaign against a career employee after an article in conservative media questioned why she was working on Iran policy.
WASHINGTON -- An internal State Department investigation released on Thursday described an "improper" campaign to remove a career employee from a high-level policy office for her perceived political disloyalty to President Trump and speculation that she had been born in Iran.
Though the case outlined in the 54-page report by the State Department's inspector general happened in 2017, it bolstered recent concerns that American diplomats are increasingly vulnerable to political interference under Mr. Trump.
An impeachment inquiry by House Democrats is looking into Mr. Trump's demands that Ukraine investigate his political opponents in exchange for $ 391 million in security aid. During the time period being examined by the House, a veteran American ambassador to Ukraine was recalled, contributing to a backlash within the diplomatic corps.
The inspector general's investigation concluded that the career employee's assignment in the State Department's office of policy planning was cut short after an article in conservative news media accused her of undermining the Trump administration's plans to confront Iran.
The March 14, 2017, article on the Conservative Review website accused the employee, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, of being a "trusted Obama aide" who "burrowed" into the State Department's bureaucracy after working on the Iran nuclear deal that the United States and other world powers brokered with Tehran in 2015. Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States from the agreement.
The article said it "remains unclear" why Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was allowed to remain working as a chief policy adviser.
State Department officials were alerted to the article both by the White House and Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker and ally of Mr. Trump. Emails described by the inspector general showed rampant speculation among senior State Department appointees about Ms. Nowrouzzadeh's policy expertise, political leanings and even whether she was born in Iran.
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was not named in the report, and was identified only as "Employee One." But, the investigation concluded, efforts to remove her from the policy planning office began almost immediately.
At one point, Edward Lacey, who was then the office's deputy director, said Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was among career civil servants who "without exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump's foreign policy agenda," according to the report. He also said he "succeeded in ousting five" of them. Mr. Lacey has since retired from the State Department.
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh also sent the article to Brian H. Hook, who at the time was the director of policy planning, to defend herself and ask for his guidance on how to respond. She told investigators that she did not receive an answer, nor from a second email, even though she had reminded Mr. Hook that she began working for the United States government during the George W. Bush administration, and was concerned about her physical and online safety after the article was published.
In a meeting in late March, Ms. Nowrouzzadeh again informed Mr. Hook she was worried about threats against her; investigators reported that Mr. Hook advised her to ignore the article. But by early April, investigators reported, Mr. Hook informed other senior officials that he would not object to removing Ms. Nowrouzzadeh from the office because he did not consider her to be a "go-getter" and did not engage with him on ideas.
Mr. Hook, who is now the State Department's special envoy for Iran policy, declined to comment. But in an eight-page response to the inspector general that was included in the report, he said he had already identified a replacement for Ms. Nowrouzzadeh in February, before the Conservative Review article was published, and had not acted on the recommendations to remove her by Mr. Lacey or Trump administration political appointees.
"I did not know Employee One's political beliefs, her service in the Bush and Obama administrations or her national origin," Mr. Hook wrote in his response. "I did not care. This is true not only for Employee One but for every person I inherited on the policy planning staff and for every person I have ever worked with during 12 years of federal public service."
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh's work in the policy planning office ended in mid-April of 2017 -- nearly three months early, investigators found. She was sent back to the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, where she had worked earlier.
The articles and emails about Ms. Nowrouzzadeh that were "circulated within the Office of the Secretary suggest that improper factors likely influenced the requests to end her detail," the inspector general concluded. The report noted her "perceived political views, association with former administrations, and perceived national origin, which are non-merit factors that may not be considered in assigning career personnel under the department's policies."
In a statement released under her name on Thursday morning, Ms. Nowrouzzadeh said she hoped the inspector general's findings would "help prompt action that will guard against any further such misconduct by members of this or any future administration."
T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a senior counselor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, defended Mr. Hook in a response that was also included in the report, saying the department's leaders disagreed with its conclusions. He said the investigators failed to recognize Mr. Hook's explanation that he had decided to replace Ms. Nowrouzzadeh weeks before the article was published.
Mr. Brechbuhl, a longtime friend and former business partner of Mr. Pompeo, has been called to testify in the House impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump to provide information about the shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that bypassed normal State Department channels. It is not clear if he will comply.
The inspector general's report also examined four other accusations by State Department employees of political interference in personnel decisions. There was no evidence of improper actions in two of the cases; in the other two, investigators found the evidence too inconclusive to determine any fault.
An earlier investigation, in August, found that career employees in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs were harassed, accused of being disloyal and viewed with hostility by a political appointee. It also concluded that two senior career officials in that bureau were either removed or blocked from advancing to prestigious jobs -- actions that violated State Department policy, the inspector general found.

Texto completo: A young foreign-affairs professional asked last week if the coming impeachment didn't feel like Watergate. He was a child during that scandal, I in college. I said no, Watergate had the feeling of real drama, it was a reckoning with who we were as a people; it felt grave. This is more like the Clinton impeachment, grubby and small.
But watching the first day of hearings I thought that wasn't quite right. There was something grave in it, and a kind of reckoning. This was due to the dignity and professionalism of the career diplomats who calmly and methodically told what they had seen and experienced. They were believable. It didn't feel embarrassing to have faith in them.
Republicans on the panel didn't know what to do. They know what this story is, and I believe they absolutely know the president muscled an ally, holding public money over its head to get a personal political favor. But they're his party, they didn't want to look weak, they had to show the base they had his back. In their interruptions and chaos-strewing they attempted to do some of what the Democrats did during the Kavanaugh hearings, only without the screaming meemies of Code Pink.
The Democrats were disciplined in their questioning and not bullying and theatrical, which was a surprise and unusual for them.
But the juxtaposition of the witnesses, the men of America's diplomatic class, with the sullen, squirrelly, off-point Republicans, was what gave the hearing shape.
William B. Taylor Jr., acting ambassador to Ukraine, 72, was fifth in his class of 800 at West Point, where he was cadet battalion commander. Bronze Star, Vietnam, 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne, 506th Infantry, Second Cavalry. After that, government work and diplomacy. He's known for his modesty. You couldn't be more impressive. Testifying along with him George P. Kent, younger and a different sort—studied Russian history and literature at Harvard and Johns Hopkins, speaks Ukrainian and Russian, 27 years in the foreign service.
They seemed to have capability and integrity. They weren't deep state; they were old school, old style, not some big dope of a political donor, as all administrations have among their ambassadors, but the people who make it work, who maintain the standards, who keep it all up and running.
This is what I saw: the old America reasserting itself, under subpoena. They were American diplomats, with stature and command of their subject matter.
And the world was seeing it, and maybe thinking, "I remember them." Older prime ministers and presidents in foreign capitals could be thinking, "I remember those pros, the bland Midwestern tough guys who knew their stuff. Good that they still exist."
Quietly, smoothly, brick by brick, they gave their testimony and painted a picture that supports the charge that yes, Donald Trump muscled Ukraine.
To the week's other attempt to make a case against the president:
I don't like to beat up books, because they're books; you can't have enough data and argumentation and art; if you don't like it, don't read it. But "A Warning," the White House insider exposé by "Anonymous," is a poor piece of work, and something false at its heart shows a deep disrespect for the reader.
What we especially need in the political world now is guts, brains and sincerity. Anonymous does not offer them.
There's nothing here that hasn't already been said in a dozen books and a thousand articles. There is little first-person testimony telling us what the author saw, what was said, what happened, what it meant.
Halfway through I realized: Anonymous isn't really hiding his identity, he's hiding the major fact of that identity, which is that he is not a significant figure. The premise of the original article in the New York Times, of which this book is an expansion, was that he was a major player—a "senior official of the Trump administration"—who's giving you what history needs, eyewitness testimony. But you get the impression the author wasn't actually in the room where it happened, or not often. Not having new, first-person information he relies on high-class padding (thoughts on Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, the role of Congress) and style. The style is midlevel ad agency, clean but with no ballast. It is by the end irritating—shallow yet haughty, common yet pretentious, and full of clichés. His Trump "takes no prisoners" and "behind closed doors" damages "the fabric of our republic." The president is historically and politically uninformed, inattentive in briefings, vengeful and dangerous, gets harebrained ideas, and says stupid things. Yes, we know. But you have to do more than assert.
Anonymous suggests he can't be specific because it would blow his cover. But without specificity the work becomes contentless and devolves into mere rhetoric and polemic. And why not be specific and let people know who you are? It would make the truths you feel demand urgent expression more credible and concrete. There's nothing dishonorable about thinking you are witnessing a catastrophe and telling the American people. But you have to look history in the face and take its punishments.
And in this case what punishments, anyway? You'll be fired? You hate where you work! You'll be insulted in tweets? So what? There are two Trump tweet lists in America, one with the names of those who've been attacked and the other with those who haven't. The first is longer, and they're still alive.
It is all so disguised, self-valorous and creepy.
Why was Anonymous there? He doesn't really say. Since he saw the emptiness and danger early on, why didn't he leave? "God knows," he says, "it would have been easy." He says he stayed because Mr. Trump is "a mess" and he wanted to help. But he gives no examples of how he helped. The fact is it's hard to leave a White House. You're unemployed, your office is gone, your old colleagues cool on you, and the neighbors are no longer impressed. Better to stay and simmer.
He claims "senior advisors and cabinet-level officials pondered a mass resignation, a 'midnight self-massacre' " to draw the public's attention to the White House disarray. But they didn't go through with it. Why? "It would shake public confidence." But diminishing public confidence in the administration was the point, no?
He refers to sensitive conversations that have not been declassified and vows not to speak of them—"such details have been omitted." But it's hard not to suspect he didn't "omit" them, he didn't know them.
"Trump wanted to use a domestic presidential power to do something absurd overseas, which for security reasons I cannot disclose." Oh come on.
This book is as edifying as Omarosa's White House memoir, but without the leavening air of insanity.
At one point Anonymous reports that at a Group of Seven meeting Trump threw some Starburst candies at Angela Merkel and said: "Here, Angela. Don't say I never gave you anything." I'd never heard that. That's news! But I Googled the quote and there it was, rows of citations attributing the anecdote to Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group.
My only advice to Anonymous is for the good of your reputation, stay that way. And if you feel such heavy daily repugnance, leave already.

ABOUT 35,000 AMERICANS DIE ANNUALLY OF DRUG-RESISTANT INFECTIONS: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause about 2.8 million infections per year and about 35,000 deaths in the U.S., according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report — twice as many deaths as estimated in 2013.
The CDC identified 18 of the most troublesome pathogens. One of the most urgently threatening is candida auris, a multi-drug resistant fungus that health professionals have kept an eye on for a few years, but didn’t appear in the U.S. until 2016. It can cause fatal infections if it enters the bloodstream, and there have been 587 cases confirmed in the U.S. since it was first diagnosed in 2009 in a patient in Japan.
On the bright side, efforts to stem the spread of bacterial and fungal infections in hospitals, where they are most likely to spread, have reduced deaths by 30%. CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield was pretty optimistic given the otherwise grim statistics: “Our collective efforts to stop the spread of germs and preventing infections is saving lives… Today’s report demonstrates notable progress, yet the threat is still real.”
Other “urgent” pathogens in the report include a bacteria that causes pneumonia and has already killed 700 people, a bacteria that causes life-threatening diarrhea that has killed 12,800 people, and a class of bacteria nicknamed “nightmare bacteria,” which is resistant to nearly all treatment options and has hospitalized 13,100 patients.
The CDC also added a watchlist for the first time to monitor three specific pathogens — including an antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea infection — that have a high risk of spreading.

ERNST INTRODUCES UPDATED FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE BILL: Republican Joni Ernst unveiled a bill Thursday that would ensure married couples who work for the same employer can each take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a new child or a sick relative. The Iowa senator calls it a “modernized” version of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which limits the amount of leave a married couple under the same boss can take. The bill already has bipartisan support from Democrats Kyrsten Sinema and Tina Smith as well as Republican Mike Lee.
HOW ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ IS PLAYING IN MICHIGAN: Moderate Democratic voters in Michigan are leery of ‘Medicare for all’ proposals favored by liberal Democratic candidates, the Wall Street Journal reports in the battleground state. “If you start talking to them about Canadian-style health care in my district, people…start to get a little nervous,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman lawmaker who beat a Republican incumbent in 2018, said after a town hall Friday in Rochester Hills, a Detroit suburb. “People start saying, ‘Well, can I keep my doctor? And am I going to be forced into something that I don’t want?’”
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS WILL BEGIN ADMINISTERING 23,000 DOSES OF NEW EBOLA VACCINE: Doctors Without Borders will begin administering a new Ebola vaccine Thursday in a northern province of Democratic Republic of Congo, home to 2 million people. Doctors without Borders is working with the DRC’s Ministry of Health to compile a study on the effectiveness of the vaccine, only the second to be introduced to the public. While the latest vaccine has been endorsed by the World Health Organization and lab studies show the vaccine creates an even better immune response than the first Ebola vaccine, which was approved in the European Union just last weekend, the only way to figure out if the vaccine truly works is to use in a real-world setting. The goal is to vaccinate 50,000 people in six sites throughout the province over a four-month period.
HHS TO LAUNCH NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY: The Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to help create new technology that will distinguish between bacterial and viral infections and determine the severity of the infections within 20 minutes. BARDA will support the development of the new diagnostic tool, known as host-response testing, under a $6 million contract with California-based Inflammatix Inc. “Rapid diagnostics are a cornerstone of our strategy to protect Americans from many bacterial and viral infections; earlier diagnosis can empower patients to take action to reduce disease transmission,” said BARDA Director Dr. Rick Bright. “Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to public health and the health security of the United States, and diagnostics that can provide rapid results to patients and doctors will support stewardship of antibiotics and save lives.”

Trump asks Supreme Court to bar release of his tax returns

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to bar his accounting firm from turning over eight years of his tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors.
The case, the first concerning Trump’s personal conduct and business dealings to reach the court, could yield a major ruling on the scope of presidential immunity from criminal investigations.
Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Trump, rejecting his argument that he was absolutely immune from criminal investigation while he remains in office. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president’s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.
Trump has fought vigorously to shield his financial records, and prosecutors in Manhattan have agreed not to seek the tax returns until the case is resolved by the Supreme Court. In exchange, they insisted on a very quick briefing schedule, one that would allow the Supreme Court to announce whether it will hear the case as soon as next month and to issue a decision by June, as the presidential election enters its final stages.
Other cases involving Trump are also in the pipeline. They involve matters as diverse as demands from House Democrats for tax and business records, a request for access to redacted portions of the report prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller, and challenges to Trump’s business arrangements under the Constitution’s emoluments clauses.
On Wednesday, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to rehear a ruling from a divided three-judge panel that Trump’s accounting firm must comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s demands for eight years of his financial records. A lawyer for Trump said he would appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, too.
The legal fight in the New York case began in late August after prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns and those of his family business dating to 2011.
The prosecutors are looking into hush-money payments made to two women just before the 2016 presidential election. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, for payments he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had an affair with Trump.
Cohen was also involved in money paid to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who also said she had a relationship with Trump. The president has denied the relationships.
Prosecutors say they need the documents to decide whether the payments violated state laws.
Trump’s lawyers sued to block the subpoena, arguing that criminal investigations of presidents are barred by the Constitution. They said sitting presidents are not only protected from being indicted, a proposition that is widely but not universally accepted, but also cannot be subjected to the burdens of criminal investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain.
When the case was argued last month before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Denny Chin asked about a statement Trump had once made — that he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without political fallout.
Chin asked William Consovoy, a lawyer for Trump, about the legal consequences of such a hypothetical crime.
“Local authorities couldn’t investigate?” Chin asked, adding: “Nothing could be done? That’s your position?”
“That is correct,” Consovoy said. “That is correct.”
In a footnote to last week’s decision, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, writing for the appeals court panel, said allowing a grand jury to inspect tax returns did not seem likely to impose a burden on Trump’s ability to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities.
“We note that the past six presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public,” Katzmann wrote. “While we do not place dispositive weight on this fact, it reinforces our conclusion that the disclosure of personal financial information, standing alone, is unlikely to impair the president in performing the duties of his office.”
Katzmann noted that Trump had conceded that his immunity would last only as long as he held office.
“There is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a president during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office,” he wrote.

Texto completo: As the impeachment process unfolds, President Donald Trump’s defenders will throw up dust clouds of complexity. But as the first day of open hearings suggested, it’s simple. Forget about Ukraine and diplomacy for a moment.
Suppose that a low-ranking government official, the head of a branch Social Security office, intervened to halt a widow’s long-approved Social Security payments. The widow, alarmed that without that income she might lose her home, would call the branch director to ask for help.
“I’d like you to do me a favor, though,” the director might respond. He would suggest that her Social Security payments could resume, but he’d like the widow to give him her late husband’s collection of rare coins.
Everybody would see that as an outrageous abuse of power. Whether we’re Republicans or Democrats, we would all recognize that it’s inappropriate for a federal official to use his or her power over government resources to extract personal benefits. The Social Security official could say that the payments eventually resumed, or assert that the widow’s son had engaged in skulduggery — but he’d be out of a job in an instant and would face a criminal investigation.
Likewise, imagine that a high school principal expelled the police chief’s son but offered to readmit the boy if the police department would just open a criminal investigation into his ex-wife before their child custody hearing.
Or suppose that the head of a public hospital offered to provide free medical care to employees of a construction company if it remodeled his kitchen?
Or what if I suggested to a university president that I was planning some glowing columns about his great institution and then asked for “a favor,” noting that my child was applying for admission.
In every case, we might disagree about whether to call this bribery, extortion or a quid pro quo, and might disagree about precisely which statute was violated, but there is no doubt this would be a firing offense and perhaps lead to a criminal investigation.
Shouldn’t we hold the president of the United States to as high a standard as the head of a Social Security office, a principal, a hospital director and a journalist?
Indeed, the Ukraine situation is still more insidious. Trump’s bullying of Ukraine and suspension of military assistance benefited our strategic rival, Russia, and it came as Ukrainians were dying in the fight for their country’s survival after a Russian invasion.
My father grew up near Chernivtsi in what is now western Ukraine — then part of Romania — and I’m appalled to think of Ukrainians dying unnecessarily because Trump was playing politics with American assistance. In effect, Trump aided Russia and perhaps killed Ukrainians for political gain.
Remember all this as we hear Trump’s defenders try to divert attention to the whistleblower, to Hunter Biden or to anything else. If the Republicans want to oversee an investigation of how children of American government officials monetize their parents, that’s a worthwhile effort. But I doubt Ivanka Trump agrees.
The first witnesses before the impeachment hearings were two distinguished foreign policy experts with a long commitment to public service and no history of partisanship. One, George Kent, noted that “there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.” And Ambassador William Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who was appointed acting ambassador to Ukraine by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, emphasized, “I am not here to take one side or the other, or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings.”
Their testimony was blunt. Trump withheld not only desperately needed security assistance to Ukraine but also a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president — unless he committed to investigating the Bidens.
“I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Taylor recalled advising other ambassadors involved in Ukraine.
Taylor also revealed something new and important. On July 26, another ambassador, Gordon Sondland, telephoned Trump, who asked about “the investigations” by Ukraine. A Taylor staff member asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, and Sondland replied that Trump cared more about the investigations into the Bidens.
Republicans on Wednesday tried to suggest that perhaps the impeachment investigation was all a misunderstanding based on secondhand accounts. But that July 26 phone call suggests that Trump was directly pushing for the investigations as his top priority with Ukraine.
Trump continues to be strongly backed by House Republicans and Fox News. That’s the biggest difference from the Watergate hearings that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. There was no Fox News then, and Republicans and Democrats alike were loyal primarily to the country and its institutions rather than to an individual.
That may no longer be true. Brace yourself in the coming weeks for smoke screens of obfuscation, but anchor yourself to this thought: What if the wrongdoing simply involved the head of a Social Security office, a principal, a hospital director or a journalist? Why allow a president to get away with what would be a firing offense for anyone else?

Texto completo: The sensations surged up from somewhere inside, like poison through a syringe: a mix of sadness, anxiety and shame that would overwhelm anyone, especially a teenager.
“I had this Popsicle stick and carved it into a sharp point and scratched myself,” Joan, a high school student in New York City, said recently; she asked that her last name be omitted for privacy. “I’m not even sure where the idea came from. I just knew it was something people did. I remember crying a lot and thinking, ‘Why did I just do that?’ I was kind of scared of myself.”
She felt relief as the swarm of distress dissolved, and she began to cut herself regularly, at first with a knife, then razor blades, cutting her wrists, forearms and eventually much of her body. “I would do it for five to 15 minutes,” she said, “and afterward I didn’t have that terrible feeling. I could go on with my day.”
Self-injury, particularly among adolescent girls, has become so prevalent so quickly that scientists and therapists are struggling to catch up. About 1 in 5 adolescents reports having harmed himself or herself to soothe emotional pain at least once, according to a review of three dozen surveys in nearly a dozen countries, including the United States, Canada and Britain. Habitual self-harm, over time, is a predictor for higher suicide risk, studies suggest.
But there are very few dedicated research centers for self-harm and even fewer clinics specializing in treatment. When youngsters who injure themselves seek help, they are often met with alarm, misunderstanding and overreaction. The apparent epidemic levels of the behavior have exposed a structural weakness of psychiatric care: Because self-injury is considered a “symptom” and not a stand-alone diagnosis like depression, the testing of treatments has been haphazard, and therapists have little evidence to draw on.
In the past few years, psychiatric researchers have begun to knit together the motives, underlying biology and social triggers of self-harm. The story so far gives parents - tens of millions worldwide - some insight into what is at work when they see a child with scars or burns. And it allows for the evaluation of tailored treatments: In one newly published trial, researchers in New York found that self-injury can be reduced with a specialized form of talk therapy that was invented to treat what’s known as borderline personality disorder.
“It used to be that this kind of behavior was confined to the very severely impaired, people with histories of sexual abuse, with major body alienation,” said Barent Walsh, a psychologist who was one of the first therapists to focus on self-injury, at the Bridge program in Marlborough, Massachusetts, now a part of Open Sky Community Services. “Then, suddenly, it morphed into the general population, to the point where it was affecting successful kids with money. That’s when the research funding started to flow.”
Joan was 13 when the cutting began. Now 16, she had greatly curtailed this routine in the past few months, she said: “But I still do it, like, every week or so.”
The most common misperception about self-injury is that it is a suicide attempt: A parent walks in on an adolescent cutting herself or himself, and the sight of blood is blinding. “A lot of people think that, but in reality, you cut for different reasons,” said Blue, 16, another high school student in the New York area, who asked that her last name be omitted. “Like, it’s the only way you know to deal with intense insecurities or anger at yourself. Or you’re so numb as a result of depression, you can’t feel anything - and this is one thing you can feel.”
Whether this method of self-soothing is an epidemic of the social media age is still a matter of scientific debate. No surveys asking about self-harm were conducted before the mid-1980s.
In the 1990s, the idea of self-injury and its underlying psychic misery began to enter popular culture. Princess Diana talked about it, in an interview; so did actors Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. A popular 2010 music video by Pink contained vivid scenes of cutting. By then, dozens of online forums were providing community, support and understanding to those who self-injured - and also, some experts say, often reinforcing the behavior, as a badge of membership in a special club.
“Nowadays a lot of younger girls especially are influenced by various media, where this whole self-harm thing is glamorized,” said Blue, who quit harming herself this year. “I was hospitalized, and it was strange: A lot of other girls were impressed by my scars, like: ‘How did you get those? I’m jealous.’ It’s disturbing, this gratification - like, people who I guess feel good or happy when they do it.”
Among current American college students, a privileged group by definition, about 1 in 5 reports having inflicted self-harm on purpose to ease emotional pain at least once, according to surveys done at 10 universities by Janis Whitlock, director of the Cornell Research Program for Self-Injury and Recovery.
The first episode occurs around age 15, on average, she said, but a large number of people who self-harm started later, at age 17 or 18.
Few people who self-harm once stop there, said Whitlock, an author of “Healing Self-Injury: A Guide for Parents.”
“About three in four continue, and the frequency tends to go up and down, as people go in and out of various stages,” she said. “It’s absolutely crazy-making for parents because it’s hard to know what’s happening.”
This pattern becomes, for about 20% of people who engage in it, a full-blown addiction, as powerful as an opiate habit. “Something about it was so grounding, and it was always there for me,” said Nancy Dupill, 32, who cut herself regularly for more than a decade before winding down the habit, in therapy; she now works as a peer specialist for adolescents in central Massachusetts. “I got to the point where I cut myself a lot, and when I came out of it, I couldn’t remember things that happened, like what set it off in the first place.”
People who become dependent on self-harm often come to treasure it as their one reliable comfort, therapists say. Images of blood, burns, cuts and scarring may become, paradoxically, consoling. In isolation, amid emotional turbulence, self-injury is a secret friend, one that can be summoned anytime. “Unlike emotional or social pain, it’s possible to control physical pain” and its soothing effect, said Joseph Franklin, a psychologist at Florida State University.
Franklin argues that the brain circuits registering physical and mental pain, while distinct, probably have some overlap. The burn of humiliation feels very different from the burn of fire, of course, but there is some evidence that the relief from yanking a hand away from the flame can activate neural circuits that register psychological relief, although this system is far from worked out.
“As a weird quirk of this effect, people who think the relief of psychological pain is worth the physical pain may reason that self-injury is a good idea,” Franklin said.
The one treatment that appears to be most effective for breaking the habit of self-harm is a specialized talk therapy, originally invented for people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, who are highly suicidal.
Through one-on-one and group therapy sessions, at least once a week for two months or more, people who injure themselves learn coping skills to weather troughs of misery. The therapy is called dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT.
In a study of 800 adolescent inpatients at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, New York, a team of doctors found that those who received DBT had far fewer incidents of self-injury, spent less time on suicide watch and had shorter hospital stays, compared to adolescents who had been treated before DBT was standard.
“There is real hope,” Dupill said, “if you let the person going through this have some control, if you listen to them, if you’re curious about their behavior and not afraid of it.”

Netflix's Content Chief Says 'Nothing Has Changed' With Disney+ Launch; Ted Sarandos said Netflix can weather competition because of its investments in original programming

Texto completo: Netflix Inc. Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said "nothing has changed" with the launch of Walt Disney Co.'s new streaming service, expressing optimism that his company is prepared to weather competition from rivals because of its investments in original programming.
"We don't really get that distracted by competition," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday at an event at New York's Paley Center for Media.
Disney+ this week launched its $6.99-a-month Disney+ service , which features an array of programming from its Star Wars and Marvel brands and a deep catalog of animated films and original programs, among other fare. Apple Inc. earlier this month launched its own services and next year AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. will join the fray in streamed entertainment.
Mr. Sarandos said with most of the major Hollywood players emerging as competitors, it's unlikely they will want to keep offering programming to Netflix. He said he envisions a world where Netflix will have to rely solely on its own content, which is why the company has invested so aggressively in originals.
"We figured at some point everybody would get into this," Mr. Sarandos said. "I was frankly surprised it took Disney and other people this long to go on this path."
Disney said Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups on its first day of service. The company did not say how many of those people received free service through a partnership with mobile provider Verizon Communications Inc., and Wall Street will be waiting to see how many users stick with Disney+ when free trials end.
Disney, which had been one of Netflix's biggest suppliers of both original and library content, has indicated it will no longer sell shows to Netflix, instead focusing on Disney+ and Hulu, which it also controls.
Mr. Sarandos also clarified recent comments that Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings had made about the company's decision to take down an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show "Patriot Act" from the streamer's Saudi Arabia service after that government's complaint.
Asked about that decision at a New York Times conference last week, Mr. Hastings said the company is "not in the 'truth to power' business, we're in the entertainment business."
"All entertainment is truth to power," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday, adding that Mr. Hastings was trying to say Netflix isn't "in the breaking news business."

Some Fla. voters are unmovable, despite probe President Trump did nothing wrong, they say

Texto completo: Some will watch, some will catch up via Fox News at night, and others will ignore the event entirely. But no matter what comes out at the public impeachment hearings that got underway Wednesday, President Donald Trump's fervent South Florida supporters say they won't waiver.
To them, the impeachment inquiry is a sham - a merit-less attempt by Democrats to damage Trump.
"It's a joke. All they do is make up lies," said Robert Korhonen, of Fort Lauderdale, one of about 100 people who attended the monthly Americans for Trump Broward meeting Tuesday night - in a county that's biggest Democratic stronghold in the state. "It's just a big frigging waste of time and I think most Americans are smart enough to understand what's going on here."
Democrats, Korhonen added, are "trying to throw as much crap against him as they can. Trump is not guilty of anything. He hasn't done anything wrong. They keep throwing crap and trying to trap him in stuff. But he's innocent. They got nothing. They got nothing."
David Lhota of Plantation, a lawyer, said information that's come out in advance of the public hearings shows the president has done nothing wrong.
Democrats see it entirely differently, that there's proof Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election by coming up with dirt that would make Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden look bad. Lhota thinks Biden's dealings in Ukraine from his time as vice president are what should be investigated.
What's going on now, he said, is "a sham, a lot of propaganda. I think it's just a vehicle to try to persuade the public prior to the elections, throw a lot of mud. See what sticks. It's a complete hoax. It's disgusting. I think it's weakening our country. It's spreading lies."
"The election didn't turn out the way they wanted, and now they're trying to change the results," Lhota said. "The only focus is on smearing the president's good name and I think people will see that. And in fact, I think it will backfire on the Democrats if they carry this out too long and keep trying to promote this propaganda."
Sofia Manolesco of Deerfield Beach, who works in the fitness industry, doesn't see the impeachment inquiry as serious. "I think that most politicians are paid actors, and they just do what they need to do to ramp up public opinion and try to get people excited."
Americans for Trump attracts die-hard supporters of the president from Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. Raffle prizes between speakers included a "border patrol kit" and a "build the wall kit." And U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only senator somewhat critical of Trump, was labeled a "rat" and an "enemy." Romney was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.
The Trump club is something of a refuge for his supporters in overwhelmingly Democratic South Florida. "You feel good among people that think the same way," said Maria Canosa, a retiree from Tamarac.
But Canosa, Korhonen and Lhota have plenty of company among Trump supporters elsewhere in Florida - and their energy is critical to the president's hope for re-election. Florida awards 29 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency - more than any of the half-dozen swing states that will decide the 2020 election.
Polling a month ago from the New York Times Upshot and Siena College found that 49% of Floridians support the impeachment inquiry, with 44% opposed - which shows the deep political divide in a state known for its extremely close elections.
Among Floridians who voted for Trump in 2016, Times/Siena poll found 16% supported the impeachment inquiry, and 81% were opposed. Among Hillary Clinton voters, 87% supported the impeachment inquiry and 8% opposed it.
Korhonen, an artist, said "most of the Democrats live in their own little bubble, their own little world, and they just don't get it. They're just so far off in lunacy world that they just don't get it."
Canosa said the impeachment hearings are simply one more way that Democrats are attempting to undermine Trump.
"They have never given this man a fair shake," she said.
Americans for Trump president Scott Newmark, like most of the club members, expect the Democratic-controlled House to impeach the president and the Republican-controlled Senate to vote against convicting and removing him from office. "It's like we're watching the movie in real time - but we know the ending."

Women presidential candidates: Unlikable?

Texto completo: Cue the misogyny. Again.
The latest example comes from a poll of registered voters in six states expected to play outsize roles in the 2020 presidential race. Nearly four in 10 (38%) of these potentially pivotal voters agreed with this overtly sexist statement: "Sometimes, it feels like most women who run for president just aren't that likable."
The very statement -- posited in a recent New York Times-Siena College poll -- is at once infuriating and comical, blatantly sexist and preposterous. This is, after all, the first time in U.S. history that one might reasonably ask any question involving most women. And while it is not the first time one might credibly ask whether the plethora of men who run for president are likable, the mere thought of that question is, well, not thought of.
Pollsters have long tried to assess whether voters felt comfortable with candidates. Gallup first asked whether each candidate was likable in 1976. Many polls have asked whom you'd prefer to grab a beer with. But those questions addressed each individual candidate (male and, when there was one, female) and didn't conjoin -- much less ridicule -- a minority of them.
This presidential election, which comes during the centennial of women's voting rights, has drawn a record number of women seeking a major-party nomination (now five, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ended her campaign). Yet we have one question, framed in the negative, that lumps them all together.
As Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, told me, "This is the thing that plagues and haunts women: Are they likable enough?"
Are 'most men' unlikable?
Why would more than 1,400 of the 3,766 registered voters in the poll agree, either strongly or somewhat, that most of these women are unlikable?
"I'm not sure if it's just these candidates, just these women, or a deep-seated resentment," said Meghann Crawford, a pollster for Siena College.
Let's contemplate that. How well, exactly, do the respondents know most of the women? What traits do they think Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help guru Marianne Williamson share? What could possibly make most of them unlikable? What, really, do they have in common?
And what of the dozen men vying for the Democratic nomination or the three competing on the GOP side, including Donald Trump? Are most of them unlikable? Are any of them? The poll didn't ask.
It has long been a given that women in politics and elsewhere (read: everywhere) are held to different standards than men, particularly when they seek or attain power. They not only have to be overqualified, they also have to be assertive (not aggressive), smart (not haughty) and serious (but not too much). They also should be nurturing (but not smothering), empathetic (but not tearful) and able to laugh (but not cackle) at themselves (and at the sexist jokes that come their way). Oh, and they shouldn't be too ambitious (read: like the men who set the standards).
If they are too (fill in the blank), they definitely will be unlikable.
But to whom? Who are these judgmental folks? The group most likely to agree that most women presidential candidates are unlikable is Republicans, at 53%. For Democrats, it's 26%.
Sinking into stereotypes
The next largest group of women-dislikers is people with a high school education or less, at 47%, followed by white people who either didn't attend or didn't graduate from a four-year college, at 44%. By contrast, 28% of all college graduates and white college graduates agreed that most women presidential candidates are unlikable. Notably, 43% of women said most of the women who run for president are unlikable; only 33% of men agreed.
One woman, Elysha Savarese of Florida, told The Times that Warren is "very cold" and "basically a Hillary Clinton clone."
How fitting. Apparently, there is only one presidential candidate in all of U.S. history to whom we can compare Warren. It is not other Massachusetts senators, like John or Teddy Kennedy, Calvin Coolidge or John Kerry. It is not another academic like Woodrow Wilson, or a law professor like William Howard Taft. It's not eggheads like Adlai Stevenson or Barack Obama. No, Warren either is or is not the new Clinton, the one woman a major party has nominated to the highest office in the land.
Let's be clear: When we compare Warren to Clinton, we're not comparing their policies, which are relatively dissimilar. We're comparing their personas. Or, rather, stereotypes of women's personas. Are they shrill? Are they nasty? Do they grate on you? Do they remind you of your first wife or your mother-in-law (to mention other stereotypically unlikable women)?
Clinton was a lightning rod whom a lot of people liked to dislike. She won the most votes anyway.
Imagine, then, what other women might do.
If only most of them were likable.

Texto completo: President Trump seemed unbothered by Turkey's recent invasion of Syria, which prompted outrage in Congress and among some in his administration.
WASHINGTON -- One month ago, President Trump warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey not to "be a fool" or "a tough guy" by invading northeastern Syria. The Turkish leader sent his troops across the border anyway, outraging much of official Washington.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed unbothered by the episode and gave Mr. Erdogan a warm welcome, offering little sign of frustration with Turkey's authoritarian leader over an incursion that scrambled American policy in the region.
"I'm a big fan of the president," Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House with Mr. Erdogan. "My dear friend," Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Erdogan's invasion of Syria, in part to attack Kurdish fighters who helped the United States crush the Islamic State, infuriated many military and diplomatic officials and prompted members of Congress to draw up punitive sanctions. Many of the same people also are angry over Turkey's recent purchase of an advanced Russian antiaircraft missile system, which legislators from both parties call grounds for separate sanctions.
Last week, a mostly Democratic group of House members called on Mr. Trump to rescind his invitation to Mr. Erdogan. On Wednesday, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, issued a statement saying that he hoped the meeting would help to restore relations with Turkey. But, he noted, "I share my colleagues' uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored at the White House."
Although Mr. Trump briefly threatened Turkey with crippling economic sanctions after its Oct. 9 invasion of Syria, he had also cleared the way for the incursion by withdrawing American forces after a phone call with Mr. Erdogan. On Wednesday, he returned to a warmer tone, stressing the value of the decades-long strategic relationship between the two countries -- both NATO members, but ones that have drifted apart over the past decade.
During remarks to reporters over the course of a day of diplomacy largely overshadowed by an impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump said he hoped that the United States and Turkey could work out their differences. The president said he wanted to increase trade between the countries by a multiple of four, to about $ 100 billion, "which would be great for Turkey and great for us."
Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that Washington and Ankara could resolve their standoff over Turkey's purchase of the Russian missile system, which leading Republicans in Congress call a clear violation of a 2017 law requiring sanctions on countries that buy military hardware from Moscow. Some members of Congress have suggested the sanctions might be avoided if Turkey does not power up the missile system.
Mr. Trump called five Republican senators to the White House on Wednesday, including some sharp critics of Mr. Erdogan, for an unusual meeting with the visiting Turkish leader.
"I project that we will work something out," Mr. Trump said. Also in the meeting were Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Jim Risch of Idaho, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
Mr. Graham, for one, betrayed a note of amazement over dropping in on a foreign leader's White House visit.
"I've never had an opportunity like this before," Mr. Graham told reporters who were briefly ushered into the room. "I appreciate it. The purpose of this meeting is to have an American civics lesson for our friends in Turkey. And there's a pony in there somewhere if we can find it."
To which Trump quickly replied: "And I think we will."
Mr. Trump repeatedly sounded sympathetic to the Turkish leader, seconding Mr. Erdogan's complaints that European nations have not contributed enough to the cost of caring for more than three million Syrian refugees who have streamed across Turkey's border since their country plunged into civil war more than eight years ago.
Mr. Trump also sided with Mr. Erdogan after the Turkish leader sharply criticized President Emmanuel Macron of France, who last week called Mr. Erdogan's invasion of Syria a dangerous mistake that will empower Iran and Russia.
"I think that bothered the president very much," Mr. Trump told reporters. "I think a lot of other people feel that way, too."
Mr. Macron also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was experiencing "brain death" because of Mr. Trump's policies.
At the end of the day, it was not clear what Mr. Erdogan's visit had actually yielded. A White House statement mentioned no tangible agreements.

Texto completo: Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who was recently chosen to lead an inquiry into clergy abuse in Buffalo, faces an accusation of molesting an altar boy in Jersey City in the 1970s.
Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, the longtime leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, sexually abused an 11-year-old altar boy during his tenure as a young priest in Jersey City in the 1970s, according to a lawyer who helped unleash Boston's priest abuse scandal.
The lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, told Catholic officials in New Jersey this week that he was preparing a lawsuit on behalf of a client who says he was molested by Bishop DiMarzio more than 40 years ago, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press, which reported the accusation.
In the letter, according to The A.P., Mr. Garabedian says that his client, Mark Matzek, 56, claims that as an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School he was repeatedly abused by Bishop DiMarzio and a second priest, Albert Mark. Father Mark is dead, the letter says.
Bishop DiMarzio, who has led the Brooklyn diocese since 2003, denied the accusation unequivocally in a statement to The A.P.
"In my nearly 50-year ministry as a priest, I have never engaged in unlawful or inappropriate behavior and I categorically deny this allegation," he said in the statement. "I am confident I will be fully vindicated."
In a new, longer statement issued by the diocese, which encompasses Brooklyn and Queens, Bishop DiMarzio added, "There will be a legal process now and I will vigorously defend myself against this false allegation."
Maria Margiotta, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Newark, which includes the Jersey City parish where Bishop DiMarzio was assigned when the abuse is alleged to have happened, confirmed that officials there had received Mr. Garabedian's letter.
"The archdiocese has reported the matter to, and is cooperating with, law enforcement," Ms. Margiotta said.
Last month, Pope Francis chose Bishop DiMarzio to investigate the Buffalo, N.Y., diocese, where Bishop Richard J. Malone has come under criticism for his handling of a mushrooming clergy abuse scandal.
Many other Catholic bishops in the United States have found themselves in similar circumstances, but Bishop Malone's approach may have embroiled him in scandal more so than most of them.
He kept a secret binder that listed priests accused of sexual abuse. He was recorded expressing more concern about his own reputation than about removing a priest whom he called a "sick puppy." And some of his own clergy have circulated a letter of no-confidence in him as calls mount for his resignation as leader of one of the Northeast's largest dioceses.
The Brooklyn diocese said on Oct. 31 that Bishop DiMarzio had concluded his investigation into the Buffalo diocese. The inquiry, described as an "apostolic visitation," involved three trips to Buffalo over seven days and interviews with 80 people, including clergy members and parishioners.
Having completed his interviews, the Brooklyn diocese said, Bishop DiMarzio would prepare a report to be delivered at an unspecified date.
Bishop DiMarzio has a long history of dealing with priest abuse scandals as a church leader.
He arrived in Brooklyn after serving as bishop of the Camden, N.J., diocese. One of his first tasks there was to help settle a scandal over the sexual abuse of children by priests that became public a few years into his tenure. He arranged payments totaling $ 880,000 to 23 plaintiffs at one point, and fought lawsuits by plaintiffs who would not settle.
In February, the Brooklyn diocese, one of the country's biggest claiming about 1.5 million adherents, named more than 100 priests that it said had been credibly accused of sexually abusing a child. It was one of the largest disclosures yet in a torrent of lists published by the church as its handling of clergy abuse has drawn the scrutiny of law enforcement officials.
"We know this list will generate many emotions for victims who have suffered terribly," Bishop DiMarzio said at the time.
"For their suffering, I am truly sorry," he added. "I have met with many victims who have told me that more than anything, they want an acknowledgment of what was done to them. This list gives that recognition and I hope it will add another layer of healing for them on their journey toward wholeness."
The release of the list came two years after the diocese publicly identified eight priests who had been defrocked for child sexual abuse offenses, in an effort to protect children who might come into contact with them.
Mr. Garabedian, who gained a measure of fame as a character in the Oscar-winning film "Spotlight," has also represented abuse victims in the Buffalo diocese. He told The A.P. that "the investigation of the diocese of Buffalo by Bishop DiMarzio is tainted because of these allegations."
Mr. Garabedian declined to share a copy of his letter to the Newark diocese with The New York Times. In an email, he elaborated on his comments about Bishop DiMarzio's role in the Buffalo inquiry.
"It is time for the police to investigate the investigator," Mr. Garabedian said. "The investigation should include questioning Pope Francis about his appointment of the bishop as investigator."
Mr. Garabedian also said that Bishop DiMarzio, who, like Bishop Malone, was in Rome this week on a previously scheduled trip, should "be immediately placed on administrative leave pending an investigation."
In his letter to the Newark archdiocese, Mr. Garabedian demanded $ 20 million in damages for Mr. Matzek.
He told The A.P. that he planned to file the lawsuit on Mr. Matzek's behalf next month, when New Jersey opens a so-called look-back window of two years. During that time, victims can sue those they accuse of sexual abuse even if their cases expired under previous statutes of limitations.
The two-year period in New Jersey is set to open on Dec 1. New York State's version of the look-back window opened on Aug. 14 and lasts one year.

Texto completo: This story was updated on Nov. 14.
Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan said Tuesday they had agreed to free American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks in a prisoner exchange with the Afghan government. The two professors at American University of Afghanistan were captured in Kabul in 2016.
But the fate of another captive in the region remains unknown. Paul E. Overby Jr., a 76-year-old author from Western Massachusetts, was abducted in May 2014 in eastern Khost Province as he sought to interview the head of a notorious Taliban faction, the Haqqani network.
Before Overby disappeared, he suggested that he was planning to cross into Pakistan, according to the FBI.
While the Taliban militants released two videos showing the professors begging for their lives, they have released no images of Overby. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Overby is believed to be dead.
Overby's wife, Jane Larson, who lives in Goshen, said Thursday in a statement to the Globe that during the last five and a half years, she had not received any definitive information regarding his status or whereabouts.
“I remain eager for information from his captors or the governments of Afghanistan or Pakistan, where he was traveling at the time of his disappearance," she said.
In a 2017 interview, Larson said her husband had traveled to Afghanistan to write about the country and the continuing war. She told The News International in Islamabad that he had health problems that required medical attention.
Larson said her husband cared deeply about Afghanistan and had studied the Koran. In the late 1980s, he had fought alongside Afghans fighting against invading Soviet forces, she said.
The FBI offered a $1 million reward for information about Overby and King. The State Department did not respond to a question about Overby's kidnapping.
The expected release of King and Weeks is a major step in the Taliban's efforts to restart peace talks with the United States. In September, President Trump announced he was canceling negotiations with the Taliban leadership after a US service member was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul.
Insurgent fighters have been battling international and Afghan government forces since they were toppled in 2001 after their government sheltered 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.
Correction: Because of a reporting error, an earlier version of this story misspelled Jane Larson's name. The Globe regrets the error.

How About A Retirement Community That Comes To You?

Texto completo: Carole Ann Basso had spent years tending to her ailing parents and disabled husband. At one point, all three were receiving hospice care in her home in northern New Jersey.
“It was so incredibly stressful,” recalled Basso, a retired high school history teacher. “I didn’t want to give my children that craziness.”
So when she moved to Lewes, Delaware, in 2012, after the deaths of her parents and husband, her own future weighed on her mind. At 69, Basso had a long-term care insurance policy and a modest pension but scant savings, which had prompted her move to a lower-cost region.
She wondered, “How am I going to take care of myself?”
In Lewes, she heard about another option in long-term care offered by a few pioneering continuing care retirement communities: a CCRC without walls.
Typically, a CCRC operates a complex or campus where residents shift from independent living to assisted living, a memory-care unit or a nursing home if their health and mobility decline.
But in continuing care at-home programs, members essentially spend the independent living years in their own houses.
In 2015, Basso joined Springpoint Choice, a program that allows her to stay in her comfortable ranch house with an also-aging English setter named Princess Leia. Diane Willoughby, her “care navigator,” checks in regularly to monitor her needs.
With luck, Basso, now 76, may remain in her home for years - or for good. If she eventually requires help with bathing, dressing or other activities of daily living, the program will provide home aides.
Moving up in care
If she can no longer live safely at home, Basso can move onto the campus of the Moorings at Lewes, the affiliated continuing care retirement community a few blocks away. Her one-time entrance fee and monthly fees will cover her long-term care costs, at home or on campus, while Medicare and her supplemental insurance pay for medical care.
“It gives you a feeling of security,” Basso said.
Though some at-home programs date to the 1990s, there are still very few. Across the country, nearly 2,000 CCRCs, mostly nonprofits, serve about 745,000 residents. Only 32, in about a dozen states, have added at-home programs.
But more senior living organizations are considering this approach, a possible answer to a perpetual conflict: Older Americans are very likely to need long-term care but often loathe the thought of leaving their homes.
“Most people want to age successfully in place; they don’t want to transition to a community,” said Kevin Ahmadi, who heads Senior Choice at Home, connected to Gulf Coast Village, a CCRC in Cape Coral, Florida. “We believe there’s a strong future for at-home programs.”
To enroll, applicants must provide medical records and financial documents. Progressive neurological diseases, like dementia or Parkinson’s disease, will disqualify applicants.
“We assume they won’t be needing any services for at least five years,” said Cecily Laidman, executive director of Springpoint Choice. But that need could arise in 15 years or the next month.
Such programs work financially, Laidman said, because many members enroll in their 70s, instead of waiting to move to a community in their 80s. They’re paying into the program for a longer period than if they had moved into a facility, allowing the programs to invest for members’ later years, when they’re more apt to need care.
Traditional CCRCs operate under an assortment of contractual arrangements. Some have high buy-in fees, refundable to varying degrees after a resident’s death; others function more like rentals. Depending on luxury and geography, they tend to serve seniors who are financially comfortable.
It’s not cheap
Often, residents sell their houses to pay entrance fees that average $107,000 to $427,000, according to a report from LeadingAge, the trade association representing nonprofit senior care providers. (LeadingAge has rebranded these entities “life plan communities.”) Monthly fees are from $2,100 to $4,200.
“It’s a great solution for people who either have means or good retirement plans, some wealth built up,” said Ruth Katz, senior vice president for public policy and advocacy at LeadingAge.
So far, the at-home programs carry lower prices, though members still pay for housing and other living costs. At Senior Choice at Home in Florida, Ahmadi said, a 75-year-old would probably pay $55,000 to $60,000 in entrance fees and about $525 a month.
At Springpoint Choice, which has about 270 members in New Jersey and Delaware, initial fees run $30,000 to $65,000, with monthly charges of $300 to $500. The fees are tax deductible.
“If in a year they have a life-changing event, they could be paying $400 a month for skilled nursing, which on the East Coast typically costs $13,000 a month,” Laidman said.
Basso joined Springpoint Choice at a bargain rate. Because she has good long-term care insurance, her entrance fee was a discounted $25,790. She paid it with the sale of her New Jersey house and her parents’ condo. Her $128 monthly fee has since increased to $146.
Handling the unexpected
She needed help far sooner than anyone had foreseen. Within months after signing her contract, she had open-heart surgery at Johns Hopkins, followed by two weeks in intensive care.
Basso then spent five weeks in rehab at the Moorings, doing physical therapy twice each day, with daily visits from Willoughby, her care navigator. Finally strong enough to go home, Basso still needed an aide for three weeks to help with shopping, laundry and meals.
“They took total care of me, and I never had to pay one cent beyond my monthly fee,” said Basso, who is now back to her independent life. “I’m not as agile as I was, but my goodness, I’m blessed.”
She’s also discovering another advantage to a CCRC without walls: Members are encouraged to join community trips, participate in activities, use the campus gyms and pools and get to know residents and staff.
“They’re connected,” Ahmadi said of at-home members. In his program, one woman changed her mind and, at 86, left her home to move into Gulf Coast Village with her newfound friends.
Though the number of continuing care retirement communities is once again growing, after taking a hit during the recession, it’s unclear whether at-home options will gain popularity. Some state regulations won’t allow them, so advocates are working to amend the laws, as has happened in Florida.
With an aging population, “the bottom line is, we’re going to need lots and lots of long-term care options,” Katz said. “We need to be experimenting and finding new models, and this is one more.”

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.

Politics &amp; Ideas: The Virginias Move in Opposite Directions

Texto completo: It is a tale of two Virginias -- and a microcosm of America's shifting political landscape.
In 1988 Michael Dukakis lost the national popular vote to George H.W. Bush, 53% to 46%. Bush performed even better in Virginia than he did nationally, taking the Old Dominion by a margin of 60% to 39%. But in West Virginia, the Massachusetts governor -- no one's idea of a populist firebrand -- defeated Bush, 52% to 47%.
The Republican candidate of 1988 exceeded his national average in Virginia by 7 points, while in West Virginia the Democratic candidate surpassed his by 6 points. Twenty-eight years later, in 2016, the Republican presidential candidate lost Virginia by 50% to 44%, 2 points worse than his national performance, while carrying West Virginia by an astounding 43 points, 69% to 26%. As a once comfortably red state turned blue, a traditionally blue state turned deep red.
These changes aren't over. As recently as 2001, Republicans controlled just about everything in Virginia -- both U.S. Senate seats, the top three statewide offices and both chambers of the state legislature. Following last week's legislative elections, which handed Democrats majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, Democrats will control all these offices for the first time in almost half a century.
Two overlapping trends -- immigration and suburbanization -- have driven this transformation. Many middle-class immigrants have settled in the suburbs, fueling Democratic gains, especially in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area.
But demography and geography aren't the whole story. Many immigrants are moderate, business-oriented professionals who would have been open to the kind of candidates Republicans once fielded. But Donald Trump is different. As one immigrant tech worker from Virginia told the New York Times last week, "The way he speaks, you get the feeling you are separate. This is not what we signed up for in America."
In many other states Republicans have long controlled, demographic diversity and suburbanization are gradually shifting the balance of power. Republicans increasingly focus their appeal on rural and small-town voters. In Arizona, the state Republican chairwoman recently opined that rural areas should be given disproportionate voting weight to prevent an emerging metropolitan-based majority from taking power.
Republicans are learning that the populist takeover of their party, which began with the tea-party revolt and culminated in Mr. Trump's nomination, is a double-edged sword. As the GOP's appeal to working-class white voters intensifies, middle-class voters -- native-born as well as immigrant -- are backing away. These voters oppose the administration's harsh immigration policies, protectionism and skepticism about longstanding international alliances. They also reject the hard-edged partisanship that has yielded endless gridlock and recriminations in the nation's capital.
These voters find Mr. Trump's demeanor and conduct deeply troubling. As numerous surveys have shown, college-educated voters -- white and nonwhite -- regard the president as dishonest, impulsive, uncaring and lacking leadership skills. They don't think he shares their values, and they believe he has damaged the dignity of the presidency.
It is these educated suburban voters who returned the Democratic Party to majority status in the U.S. House last year. Their enthusiasm has opened the door to a new national Democratic majority. The question now is whether Democrats will seize this opportunity -- or blow it.
A recent New York Times/Siena College survey of six key swing states offers some clues about their thinking. Sixty-two percent of Democrats in these states prefer a candidate who promises to seek common ground with Republicans over one who promises to fight for a "bold progressive agenda." Fifty-five percent favor a candidate who is more moderate than most Democrats over one who is more liberal. Forty-nine percent want a candidate who promises "to bring politics in Washington back to normal," rather than "to bring fundamental systemic change to American society."
Among Democrats in these six states, there's limited appetite for continuing partisan strife, let alone revolution. Unfortunately for them, none of these states will conduct primary contests in February, and only one -- North Carolina -- will be among the Super Tuesday states that vote March 3. By the time these swing-state voters cast their ballots, the Democratic nomination could be a fait accompli -- and the presumptive nominee may not share their moderate views.
Republicans who are going along with Mr. Trump -- that's most of them -- are betting that enough states will remain enough like West Virginia to allow them to hold the presidency and Senate. Democrats are betting that enough states will become enough like Virginia to allow them to wrest back control.
In the long run, Democrats will win the bet -- if their candidates remain attuned to the beliefs of the new majority.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Pro sports alliance tries to alter politics of gambling

Texto completo: Fifteen months ago, on a hot August evening, the top executives of Atlanta's four professional sports teams - the Braves, the Hawks, the Falcons and Atlanta United - gathered at the War Horse, a private dining club on Northside Drive.
Over steaks and a bit of paperwork, they agreed to band together and attempt a fundamental change in the politics of legalized gambling at the state Capitol.
"At our core, we're all huge sports fans," Steve Koonin, CEO of the Atlanta Hawks, who was one of the diners. "We got ourselves aligned and have worked together really, really well as a unit, because we all want to do the same thing. We all want an illegal activity to be made legal. And we want it to be taxed."
On Monday, a year and change later, the umbrella organization the Big Four will use to make their case was unveiled: The Georgia Professional Sports Integrity Alliance. Signing onto the cause, in addition to Koonin, was Derek Schiller, president and CEO of the Braves; Rich McKay, president and CEO of the Falcons; and Darren Eales, president of Atlanta United.
The quartet is calling for a new state law -- the initial strategy is aimed at avoiding a constitutional amendment -- to legalize wagering on professional sports via mobile phones and the Internet. Betting on the sacred Southern institution of college football would remain illegal, as would wagering on professional minor league teams.
All would be regulated by the Georgia Lottery Commission. State revenue generated would go to the HOPE program.
Right about now, you're wondering how this is different than any other push we've seen over the past decade -- all unsuccessful -- to expand gambling in Georgia beyond the lottery. The answer is twofold.
First, previous conversations have focused on casinos - er, destination resorts - and horse racing facilities. Those would become, critics have argued, physical magnets for unsavory activities. This sports-wagering proposal would be architecturally invisible and thus, one could argue, more politically digestible. Even betting kiosks would be barred from the three metro Atlanta stadiums involved.
The teams say they will not partake of any proceeds from licensed wagering outlets. "We would not book bets, take bets. I imagine they would be advertisers, but that would be about it," Koonin said. "We're not the house. We're not bookies. It's pure opt in, via the phone."
The larger reason to treat this effort as something different is the fact previous gambling expansion efforts have originated with entities located beyond Georgia's borders. The best example may be that day in 2015 when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson parked his limousine on the Mitchell Street side of the state Capitol - so that he could have a chat with a few of the more important people inside.
This would be the first gambling initiative instigated by home-grown institutions, which matters - economically and politically. Also note the four franchises offer a bipartisan balance, which could become important in January.
The Braves' move to Cobb County in 2017 has made the team a GOP favorite. National Football League stats say fans of the Falcons list slightly Republican. The Hawks and Atlanta United, meanwhile, cater to a Democratic demographic, if age and race are any guide.
The timing of the four-sport effort is no coincidence. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal ban on commercial sports betting in most, but not all states.
The New York Times quickly offered up this forecast of the coming revolution: "Placing bets will be done on mobile devices, fueled and endorsed by the lawmakers and sports officials who opposed it for so long. A trip to Las Vegas to wager on March Madness or the Super Bowl could soon seem quaint."
The dinner at the War Horse in Atlanta came three months later.
Possibly, you're baffled by the sports quartet's claim they don't intend to make any direct profit off the bets placed on their players. Although they do want some control over what kind of bets are placed - nothing that can be easily "fixed," like who makes the first foul in a basketball game, or whether the first pitch in an inning is a ball or strike.
And they want control of the statistics that might be used by the betting world - batting averages, completion stats and such.
So why do they want this? All four sports now live in a fractured TV universe with declining viewership. Video streaming is the uncertain future. Koonin said the Atlanta teams are taking a lesson from European soccer on the link between sports betting and fan investment in a team.
"How do you raise a generation that loves going to the games but has the attention span of a goldfish?" Koonin asked. "It's about engagement. The economic benefits go to the state. And an illegal activity becomes legal."
Last spring, the Tennessee state legislature passed a bill to permit sports betting. The governor allowed it to become law without his signature. The Atlanta alliance thinks Georgia could see more than the $50 million a year in state revenue the Tennessee initiative is expected to generate, but they're using that figure as a starting point.
Success in Georgia's Legislature next year could depend on whether backers choose to pursue a simple bill that would require majority approval in both chambers, or a constitutional amendment that would require two-thirds passage - and approval in a November referendum.
Last month, the Office of Legislative Counsel, in an opinion written in response to a request by state Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, a horse racing advocate, noted our state Constitution isn't as clear on the topic of sports betting as it might be.
It forbids casino gambling and pari-mutuel betting, but sports betting falls into neither category. Which allows for the argument "the regulation of other forms of betting and gambling rests with the General Assembly," wrote Stuart Morelli, deputy legislative counsel.
But that's not a sure thing. "Because there are even odds on whether or not the Georgia Constitution currently prohibits sports betting, the only surefire way to avoid years of protracted litigation over the matter would be a constitutional amendment," he advised.

Texto completo: A Star Wars series is on Disney's new streaming service. And an acclaimed directorial debut is available for rental elsewhere.
What's Streaming
THE MANDALORIAN Stream on Disney Plus. A hand on a holster. Animals galloping over parched land. A mysterious, caped figure walking into the sunset. This new Star Wars series from Jon Favreau brings strong echoes of Sergio Leone and John Ford to George Lucas's galaxy far, far over yonder. Part of a slate of programming Disney is using to introduce its new streaming service, "The Mandalorian" casts Pedro Pascal (best known for getting his skull crushed as Oberyn Martell in "Game of Thrones") as a bounty hunter. His story picks up several years after Luke Skywalker and company celebrated victory in "Return of the Jedi," but before the plots of the newer Star Wars episodes of the 2010s. The show's cast also includes Giancarlo Esposito, Carl Weathers, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and Werner Herzog -- but the secret weapon here may be the Swedish musician Ludwig Goransson, who has followed up recent work on "Black Panther" and Childish Gambino's "This is America" by scoring all eight episodes of "The Mandalorian."
THE CHAMBERMAID (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Mexico's entry in the best international feature category at the Academy Awards centers on a maid at a high-rise hotel in Mexico City. The movie follows that maid, Eve (Gabriela Cartol), through her day-to-day life, including a friendship; a romance; and a window into the lives of guests, who leave behind pieces of themselves in the form of books, bloodstains and more. The film was directed by Lila Avilés, and is a "quietly stunning debut feature," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Avilés approaches Eve's inner life with frank and tactful sympathy, and depicts her circumstances with unsentimental clarity," he added. "The film's style is austere -- there are few camera movements and no musical score -- but its visual wit and emotional sensitivity lift it above the minimalist miserablism that drags down so many well-meaning films about modern workers. After you've seen it, the world looks different."
MARADONA IN MEXICO Stream on Netflix. Earlier this year, the famous Argentine footballer Diego Maradona was the subject of an HBO documentary that chronicled his storied career. A different side of Maradona can be found in this docuseries, which follows the athlete during a recent period when he was coaching the Dorados de Sinaloa, a team based in Culiacán, Mexico.
What's on TV
LIFE FROM ABOVE 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). While "The Mandalorian" offers an escape to a galaxy of jedi and starships, this series goes to space to look back at Earth. The previous couple episodes used strikingly detailed satellite imagery to showcase the colors and patterns as seen from above; Wednesday night's episode uses such images to look at the way the planet has changed over the years, and at humans' dramatic impact on the Earth's landscapes.

Texto completo: On Friday, House investigators released the transcript of former National Security Council official Fiona Hill’s testimony from last month. It showed a Republican staff member trying and failing to get Hill to concede that there might be some validity to the conspiracy theories underlying Donald Trump’s demands of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine.
“Are you familiar with the, you know, the allegation about Serhiy Leshchenko?” asked the Republican aide, Steve Castor. He added, “You know, relating to publicizing Manafort’s role in the Ukraine?”
Leshchenko, whom I interviewed in October, is a former member of Parliament in Ukraine and probably the most famous investigative journalist in the country. He helped expose the so-called black ledger that listed $12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, from his client Viktor Yanukovych, the wildly corrupt Russian-aligned oligarch who ruled Ukraine until 2014. Manafort is in federal prison in part for failing to disclose or pay taxes on the millions he sucked out of Ukraine. Nevertheless, to make Trump’s demands of Zelenskiy seem just and rational, some Republicans have started painting Manafort as the victim of Leshchenko’s plotting.
Hill, a Russia expert and co-author of a psychological study of Vladimir Putin, tried to shut down this line of questioning. “The Ukrainian government did not interfere in the U.S. election,” she said, adding, “The Ukrainian Special Services also did not interfere in our election.” As the Republican questions continued, Hill seems to have grown almost indignant. “I’m really worried about these conspiracy theories, and I’m worried that all of you are going to go down a rabbit hole, you know, looking for things that are not going to be at all helpful to the American people or to our future election in 2020,” she said.
She is right to be concerned. This week, as part of its impeachment inquiry, the House begins public hearings into Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine’s president into starting bogus investigations to benefit Trump politically. Republicans have telegraphed several possible defenses of the president.
The Washington Post reported that House Republicans may try to throw hapless Trump lackeys Rudy Giuliani, Mick Mulvaney and Gordon Sondland under the bus, suggesting they “could have acted on their own to influence Ukraine policy.” Other Republicans have settled on calling Trump’s actions “inappropriate” but not impeachable. But the House Republicans who are actually involved in the hearings seem set to go all in on the fantasy of Ukrainian election interference. To exonerate Trump, they are ready to help cover for Russia.
On Saturday, Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, sent the committee’s chairman, Adam Schiff, a list of people Republicans want to call to testify. To understand the significance of some of the names, you’d have to plunge into the very rabbit holes Hill warned of. Luckily, Nunes made his intention clear, writing of Trump’s “documented belief that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election,” which “forms the basis for a reasonable desire for Ukraine to investigate the circumstances surrounding the election.”
The conspiracy theories that undergird the president’s “documented belief” aren’t really coherent, but they don’t have to be to serve their purpose, which is sowing confusion about the well-established fact that Russia assisted Trump’s campaign. They posit not just that Manafort was set up but also that Democrats worked with Ukraine to frame Russia for hacking Democrats’ emails, a dastardly Democratic plot that led to Trump’s election. Naturally, George Soros, perennial scapegoat for the far right, is also involved.
“George Soros was behind it. George Soros’ company was funding it,” Giuliani said on ABC in September, spinning tales of Hillary Clinton’s collusion with Ukraine. Speaking to The Post, Giuliani accused Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, of “working for Soros.” Indeed, Hill in her testimony suggested that a sort of Infowars-era McCarthyism has been loosed on the national security bureaucracy, with “frankly an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Soros” used to “target nonpartisan career officials and also some political appointees as well.”
Some of these lies seem to have originated in Russia; documents from the Mueller investigation recently obtained by BuzzFeed News show that Manafort was blaming Ukraine for the Democratic National Committee hack back in 2016, a story he apparently got from one of his associates, a former Russian intelligence officer named Konstantin Kilimnik. (Hill testified that she’d encountered Kilimnik in a previous job, and “all of my staff thought he was a Russian spy.”)
A few of Trump’s more responsible aides have reportedly tried to disabuse him of Ukraine conspiracy theories, to no avail. Instead it appears that House Republicans, out of slavish fealty to the president, are going to use high-profile hearings to amplify them.
In her testimony, Hill seemed to warn Republicans off their current path. She mentioned the report issued last month by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee about how Russia used online propaganda to boost Trump in 2016. “If we have people running around chasing rabbit holes because Rudy Giuliani or others have been feeding information to The Hill, Politico, we are not going to be prepared as a country to push back on this again,” she said. “The Russians thrive on misinformation and disinformation.” Unfortunately, so do Trump’s defenders.

Texto completo: La compañía Tribune Publishing anunció este martes el cierre del periódico Hoy, que servía a la comunidad hispanohablante del área de Chicago.
El semanario dejará de circular el 13 de diciembre. También se acabará su sitio web.
El periódico fue lanzado en 2003 como reemplazo del semanario Éxito y fue diario por varios años. En 2017 pasó a ser semanario después de un par de años circulando tres días a la semana. Actualmente operaba con cerca de media docena de empleados.
Relacionado: Suspenden operación del New York Times en Español
La publicación era la última de la marca Hoy que quedaba en funcionamiento. Hoy nació en Nueva York en 1998, y se expandió a Chicago y Los Ángeles al ser adquirido por Tribune Co. en 2000 .
Impremedia, propietaria de El Diario y La Opinión, adquirió Hoy Nueva York en 2007, cuando era un diario de distribución gratuita. El medio cerró en 2009.
En agosto pasado, el semanario Hoy Los Ángeles fue cerrado por Los Angeles Times para dar paso a Los Angeles Times en Español, que solamente opera de manera digital.
Tribune Publishing ofreció a los empleados de Hoy Chicago vincularse a plazas abiertas en el Chicago Tribune.
El sindicato del Chicago Tribune lamentó el cierre de Hoy.
“Estamos profundamente decepcionados de que Tribune Publishing esté cerrando Hoy, que ha ido más allá de los estereotipos y ha proporcionado noticias significativas al vasto cuerpo de hispanohablantes en nuestra región. Esto es perjudicial para nuestros periodistas, nuestros lectores y nuestra empresa”, escribió el sindicato en su cuenta de Twitter.
We're deeply disappointed that Tribune Publishing is shutting down Hoy, which has gone beyond stereotypes and provided meaningful news to the vast body of Spanish-speakers in our region. This is a disservice to our journalists, our readers and our company.

The Virginias Move in Opposite Directions; Democrats dominate the Old Dominion, where Dukakis didn't crack 40% in 1988.

Texto completo: It is a tale of two Virginias—and a microcosm of America's shifting political landscape.
In 1988 Michael Dukakis lost the national popular vote to George H.W. Bush, 53% to 46%. Bush performed even better in Virginia than he did nationally, taking the Old Dominion by a margin of 60% to 39%. But in West Virginia, the Massachusetts governor—no one's idea of a populist firebrand—defeated Bush, 52% to 47%.
The Republican candidate of 1988 exceeded his national average in Virginia by 7 points, while in West Virginia the Democratic candidate surpassed his by 6 points. Twenty-eight years later, in 2016, the Republican presidential candidate lost Virginia by 50% to 44%, 2 points worse than his national performance, while carrying West Virginia by an astounding 43 points, 69% to 26%. As a once comfortably red state turned blue, a traditionally blue state turned deep red.
These changes aren't over. As recently as 2001, Republicans controlled just about everything in Virginia—both U.S. Senate seats, the top three statewide offices and both chambers of the state legislature. Following last week's legislative elections, which handed Democrats majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, Democrats will control all these offices for the first time in almost half a century.
Two overlapping trends—immigration and suburbanization—have driven this transformation. Many middle-class immigrants have settled in the suburbs, fueling Democratic gains, especially in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area.
But demography and geography aren't the whole story. Many immigrants are moderate, business-oriented professionals who would have been open to the kind of candidates Republicans once fielded. But Donald Trump is different. As one immigrant tech worker from Virginia told the New York Times last week, "The way he speaks, you get the feeling you are separate. This is not what we signed up for in America."
In many other states Republicans have long controlled, demographic diversity and suburbanization are gradually shifting the balance of power. Republicans increasingly focus their appeal on rural and small-town voters. In Arizona, the state Republican chairwoman recently opined that rural areas should be given disproportionate voting weight to prevent an emerging metropolitan-based majority from taking power.
Republicans are learning that the populist takeover of their party, which began with the tea-party revolt and culminated in Mr. Trump's nomination, is a double-edged sword. As the GOP's appeal to working-class white voters intensifies, middle-class voters—native-born as well as immigrant—are backing away. These voters oppose the administration's harsh immigration policies, protectionism and skepticism about longstanding international alliances. They also reject the hard-edged partisanship that has yielded endless gridlock and recriminations in the nation's capital.
These voters find Mr. Trump's demeanor and conduct deeply troubling. As numerous surveys have shown, college-educated voters—white and nonwhite—regard the president as dishonest, impulsive, uncaring and lacking leadership skills. They don't think he shares their values, and they believe he has damaged the dignity of the presidency.
It is these educated suburban voters who returned the Democratic Party to majority status in the U.S. House last year. Their enthusiasm has opened the door to a new national Democratic majority. The question now is whether Democrats will seize this opportunity—or blow it.
A recent New York Times/Siena College survey of six key swing states offers some clues about their thinking. Sixty-two percent of Democrats in these states prefer a candidate who promises to seek common ground with Republicans over one who promises to fight for a "bold progressive agenda." Fifty-five percent favor a candidate who is more moderate than most Democrats over one who is more liberal. Forty-nine percent want a candidate who promises "to bring politics in Washington back to normal," rather than "to bring fundamental systemic change to American society."
Among Democrats in these six states, there's limited appetite for continuing partisan strife, let alone revolution. Unfortunately for them, none of these states will conduct primary contests in February, and only one—North Carolina—will be among the Super Tuesday states that vote March 3. By the time these swing-state voters cast their ballots, the Democratic nomination could be a fait accompli—and the presumptive nominee may not share their moderate views.
Republicans who are going along with Mr. Trump—that's most of them—are betting that enough states will remain enough like West Virginia to allow them to hold the presidency and Senate. Democrats are betting that enough states will become enough like Virginia to allow them to wrest back control.
In the long run, Democrats will win the bet—if their candidates remain attuned to the beliefs of the new majority.

Report: Walgreens in talks with KKR

Texto completo: Walgreens Boots Alliance is in talks with private equity firm KKR to take the drugstore chain private in what could be one of the largest leveraged buyouts, Bloomberg reported Monday.
New York-based KKR has approached Walgreens about a proposal to potentially buy out shareholders of Walgreens, unnamed sources told Bloomberg, but it is unclear whether the proposal is feasible because of the large amount of financing required. The two companies could decide not to pursue a deal, said people who asked Bloomberg not to be identified.
If a deal were to come to pass, it would reunite Walgreens Chairman Stefano Pessina with KKR. In 2007, they joined forces to take European pharmacy company Alliance Boots private.
Walgreens and KKR declined to comment.
News broke last week that Deerfield-based Walgreens has been exploring a potential deal to take the company private as the pharmacy chain grapples with shifting consumer habits and pressures on its pharmacy business.
The step would remove the company from the public eye and could make it easier to focus more on in-store health services, which could draw in customers and better position Walgreens to compete with CVS Health, analysts said. It would mean the retailer and pharmacy would not have to answer to shareholders for the first time since 1927 as well as not abide by the regulatory reporting requirements of publicly traded firms.
KKR was founded in 1976 by best friends and first cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts. They were joined by their mentor, Jerome Kohlberg, who left the firm in 1987 over differences in buyout strategy. Kravis and Roberts became known for their aggressive, often hostile, takeovers of large conglomerates. Kohlberg, who died in 2015, preferred smaller deals and a more friendly approach, according to his obituary in the New York Times.
The firm is perhaps best known for its $25 billion hostile takeover of food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco in 1986, a deal scrutinized by Congress for allegedly avoiding taxes and contributed to KKR becoming the poster child for Wall Street's buyout-crazy, debt-driven '80s. That same year, the company was behind big deals such as the purchase of Beatrice -- at the time the largest leveraged buyout in history -- and grocery giant Safeway. Other big KKR deals during the 1980s included battery maker Duracell and grocery store Stop & Shop.
In 2007, KKR and other investors, including Pessina, took European pharmacy Alliance Boots private. Five years later, in an effort to to expand its global footprint, Walgreens announced plans to acquire Alliance Boots, which would become Walgreens Boots Alliance. KKR reportedly pocketed $7.3 billion when the two-part deal was completed in 2015.
In September 2010, KKR went public.
Walgreens has a market cap of about $53 billion and $16.8 billion of debt. That means taking it private would top the largest leveraged buyout in history: the 2007 sale of utility TXU Corp. to KKR and TPG, which was worth about $45 billion including debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The news comes weeks after the company laid off employees and said it won't pay annual bonuses this year as it works to increase its cost-cutting goal to $1.8 billion annually. Walgreens also previously announced plans to close 200 of its stores and said it would eliminate health insurance for a number of eligible retirees after this year. Walgreens has more than 18,750 stores worldwide.

Texto completo: Tim Taylor was about to end the mission. His team had scoured the seabed off Japan with autonomous underwater vehicles, which are essentially high-tech drones, without a hit. His ship now needed repairs, and a $7 million drone had just reported an error on its latest dive.
All that remained was to download the data from that drone before heading hundreds of miles back to shore.
That's when they spotted it: an unusual reading on the ocean floor, more than 1,400 feet deep. The next day, another submersible with high-definition cameras went to investigate. The images it beamed back left no doubt about what Taylor's team had found: A hulking ship lay rusting in the pitch-black water. As the camera rounded the bow and panned to the bridge, an eerily preserved plaque came into view: USS Grayback.
"It was amazing. Everyone was excited," Taylor told The Washington Post. "Then you realize there are 80 men buried there, and it's a sobering experience."
Taylor's discovery on June 5 solved an enduring 75-year-old mystery about the fate of the USS Grayback, one of World War II's most effective submarines. The U.S. Navy confirmed Sunday that Taylor's team, part of a group dedicated to finding the 52 American submarines lost in action during World War II, found Grayback's final resting place in the ocean off Okinawa, Japan.
The news brought closure to relatives of the sailors lost that day.
"There's a book I read, and it said these ships are known only to God," Gloria Hurney, whose uncle, Raymond Parks, died on the Grayback, told ABC News. "But now we know where the Grayback is."
The Grayback's final mission started on Jan. 28, 1944, according to the Navy's official history, when it left Pearl Harbor on its 10th combat tour. Commissioned in 1941, the Tambor-class sub had spent the war patrolling the South Pacific and South China Sea, torpedoing numerous enemy vessels and rescuing downed American aviators. The Grayback sank more than a dozen Japanese ships in all, The New York Times reported.
On Feb. 24, 1944, the sub reported sinking two Japanese cargo ships days earlier and was ordered back to replenish its torpedo supply. But it never arrived in Midway.
After the war, the Navy used Japanese military records to try to piece together a history of its lost subs and pinpointed the submarine's final resting place as about 100 miles east-southeast of Okinawa, the Times reported.
But its remains were never found -- until Taylor took on the case.
In 2010, Taylor, an undersea explorer and CEO of a New York-based firm that provides autonomous underwater vehicles, discovered the USS R-12, which sank in an accident off Key West, Florida, in 1943. He set up a privately funded group called the Lost 52 Project, dedicated to using new technology to find long-lost World War II subs. Along with his wife, fellow explorer Christine Dennison, his team found three more vessels before tackling the Grayback.
In this case, he relied on a key discovery by Yutaka Iwasaki, a systems engineer in Kobe, Japan, who works with Taylor's team as a researcher. While poring over original Japanese military documents, he found reports showing that on Feb. 27, 1944, a Japanese aircraft had dropped a 500-pound bomb on the Grayback. The coordinates given in that report suggested the Navy had made a crucial error when translating the coordinates where the sub was attacked.
"It was off by one digit," Taylor said. "That changed the location by more than 100 miles."
Armed with the correct information, his team journeyed in June into the open seas off Japan with a fleet of the latest submersible drones.
"The most compelling moment was when the camera went from the bow up to the bridge and we all saw the plaque," Taylor said. "There was no doubt about it."

Texto completo: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is considering a late entry into the Democratic presidential race, according to two people familiar with Patrick's thinking, potentially adding another name to an already unsettled primary field less than three months before the Iowa caucus.
One person familiar with Patrick's thinking said he is “strongly considering" running and may announce his decision this week. This person also said Patrick had reached out to former vice president Joe Biden to let him know he was weighing the move. A second person said an announcement from Patrick could come Thursday.
The New York Times, which first reported Patrick's deliberations, said the former governor has told Democratic officials that none of the current Democrats running for president has sufficient political momentum.
That's a concern echoed among some party elites, who are hand-wringing behind the scenes about the shakiness ofearly frontrunner Biden and worry that his liberal challengers, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, would run too far to the left to be electable against President Trump. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also worried about the field and weighing a run, his advisers confirmed.
The window for Patrick's decision is rapidly closing. He has already missed the deadline to be on the ballot in Alabama, a Super Tuesday state; the deadline for Arkansas, another such state, is Tuesday; and the deadline to get on the ballot in New Hampshire is this Friday.
Nearly a year ago, Patrick, 63, announced he would not seek the presidency, citing the “cruelty" of the elections process and acknowledging doubts that he could cut through the noise of a crowded and chaotic primary. “It's hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational, or a celebrity — and I'm none of those things and I'm never going to be any of those things," he said then.
One obstacle was Patrick's relatively low national profile, though he spent much of 2018 campaigning widely for Democrats in the midterms, granting national media interviews. He was the subject of lengthy profile in the New Yorker.
Patrick, the first black governor of Massachusetts, served from 2007 to 2015 and is a close friend and ally of former president Barack Obama. Like Obama, Patrick has an inspiring life story — rising from the welfare rolls in Chicago to the top levels of government and the inner sanctums of corporate boardrooms — and is seen as a skilled campaigner and powerful public speaker.
“I don't think I've ever met anybody better at campaigning than Deval Patrick," David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Obama who helped Patrick get elected governor in Massachusetts, told the Globe in April 2018. He said at the time that Patrick could articulate a unifying message that would be a good antidote to Trump's divisiveness.
Indeed, Patrick, who once headed the civil rights division of the Justice Department under President Clinton, had been dusting off his soaring, hopeful rhetoric before audiences last year in key primary states such as South Carolina as he stumped for other candidates. If he runs, Patrick will likely attempt to cut into Biden's strong support among that state's black voters.
“There's lot of buzz about it. He has lots of friends here and I believe could fundamentally reshape the race in South Carolina if he runs," said Tyler Jones, a Democratic strategist in the state.

Patrick's background as a progressive but also pragmatic executive could help him stand out in the current field, argued Joshua Boger, a Democratic donor and founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. “I think he's very solidly in the mainstream of the progressive side of the Democratic Party without being on any extreme," Boger said. “But he's actually practical. A governor has to get things done."
But the hurdles Patrick would face should he decide to run are formidable. He is not as well-known nationally as the Democrats running at the front of the pack. Patrick also doesn't have anything approaching the personal resources of Bloomberg, who is worth a reported $53 billion, to help him make up ground in the fund-raising race. A federal political action committee affiliated with Patrick had no cash on hand as of April.
There's also the matter of time. If he gets in the race this week, there will be roughly 80 days until the Iowa caucuses and 90-some days to the New Hampshire primary. Other candidates have been building organizations for a year or more — and voters in many of these states expect to see candidates multiple times.
Two of his closest former aides are tied up with other candidates. John Walsh, who served as Patrick's 2006 gubernatorialcampaign manager, is leading Senator Edward J. Markey's contested reelection campaign. Doug Rubin, another close former aide who also worked on Warren's 2012 Senate campaign, is working for billionaire candidate Tom Steyer.
“If Deval Patrick decides to run for president, I will not be a part of his campaign," Walsh said in a statement.
Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist, said the only way Patrick could pull off a primary victory is if “the Obama operation from top to bottom — all of it — gets behind him." Even then, she added, “it would be the longest of long shots."
Judy Reardon, an environmental activist and longtime Democratic operative in New Hampshire, also raised doubts that Patrick would be able to threaten the race's top contenders entering this late and without money in the bank. “Where does he think he's going to win? If he can't do exceptionally well in one of the four early states, you have to have just a ton of money," she said.
Patrick also could find himself under attack from his more populist rivals over his Wall Street ties. After he left the governor's office, Patrick went to work as a managing director for Bain Capital, an investment firm that drew attacks from Democrats after its founder and Patrick's predecessor as governor, Mitt Romney, ran for president. His former employers include Texaco, Coca-Cola, and other corporate giants.
“The only thing worse for his chances than working at Bain is waiting this late to enter," Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton, said.
If Patrick does enter the race, he would find himself facing off against fellow Massachusetts politician Warren, who is at the top or near the top of several polls. The two have said they are friends but would operate in very different lanes of the primary, given Warren's populist rhetoric about the excesses of Wall Street and corporate greed.
And although it's true none of the Democratic frontrunners has managed to lock down the race yet, it's still unclear if Democratic voters share the same questions about the field that are driving a wave of late-breaking candidates.
As governor, Patrick was credited with securing reforms in transportation and education and launching initiatives that stimulated the clean energy and biotechnology industries. But he was criticized for severe management failures and the death of children in the state's child welfare system.

Seeking a Path to Trust

Texto completo: "There's an old saying, 'Things move at the speed of trust,"' Brian Chesky, co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, said on Wednesday at The New York Times DealBook conference. "Well, how could you possibly trust something on a platform if you don't even know if it's true?" If there is one singular issue that defines the intersection of business and policy at this moment, it is a deepening trust deficit. That appeared to be the conclusion of some of the most consequential leaders who came together for this year's conference, "Playing for the Long Term." The words "trust" and "responsibility" were peppered throughout more than a dozen conversations as well as what needs to change to regain that trust.
Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, talked about the distrust between the United States and China, and his worries that such mistrust is missing a bigger point.
"If you're so paranoid," he said, "you know, what about the code that's being written by somebody whose grandmother was Chinese, or great-grandmother was Chinese? My God, just think about it. I mean, is there any piece of software in the world that you're willing to trust?"
Hillary Clinton said she was worried about Facebook's decision to allow paid political advertising.
"Information is the bloodstream of a democracy," she said. "And if we are living in a world increasingly where the press -- the historic, traditional press -- is under constant attack, the internet is filled with all kinds of unreliable and often blatantly false information, how do we even begin to judge that?"
Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing -- which is in the midst of a crisis concerning its grounded 737 Max -- talked about trying to regain the public's trust in personal terms.
"It's fair to say I've thought about" resigning, he said. "But to be frank, that's not what's in my character. I don't see running away from a challenge, resigning, is the right solution." He added that the way he grew up, "what I believe in today, and the values I try to share with my team, is when we have challenges we face into them."
But the issue of trust -- or lack of it -- crystallized in the discussion with Mr. Chesky.
"I think many of us in this industry over the last 10 years are going from a hands-off model, where the internet's an immune system, to realizing that's not really enough, that we have to take more responsibility for the stuff on our platform," he said. "And I think this has been a gradual, maybe too gradual, transition for our industry."
Mr. Chesky's comments came in the wake of a shooting that killed five people and injured several others at an Airbnb property on Halloween.
Mr. Chesky said he planned to change the way the company operates -- no longer relying solely on crowdsourced reviews. He plans to verify the properties on his site, often manually. It is a reversal from the way so many tech companies have operated for years, relying on customers to provide star ratings to other customers rather than vet much of what's on their platforms themselves.
"When I came to Silicon Valley 10 years ago, the word 'technology' may as well have been a dictionary definition for the word 'good,"' he said. "We all believed it: Technology equals good. Because technology is progress, and every piece of progress is a step forward for humanity. So therefore if you're in the technology business, you're 'making the world a better place.'
"And I think the problem with that culture is it made us not ask really thoughtful questions about, well, what is the impact of our technology on society?"
That conversation is clearly beginning to happen, both within the world of business leaders and policymakers and beyond. Even Kim Kardashian West jumped in to the trust debate on social media, long her preferred medium. She is particularly concerned about social media's impact on young people.
"I think taking the 'likes' away -- taking that aspect away from it -- would be really beneficial for people" and their mental health, she said.
Businesspeople and policy leaders are scrambling for new ways to engender trust with constituents, including shareholders, employees and regulators. Some are trying to be more transparent. Others are diving into political and social issues that used to be verboten. Perhaps more than anything, they're speaking publicly more about their thinking.
Alex Gorsky, the chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, explained how he had tried to communicate more with his employees.
"It's a little bit like a bank account," he said. "If you have an ongoing conversation, and you're making contributions to that account over time, you're building trust, you're being open, you're being transparent, you're being authentic with them." He said he was giving "them the opportunity to have a debate." He added: "Then I think you're going to build a lot of trust. Because someday you're likely going to need to make a withdrawal."

California makes life even harder for its writers

Texto completo: I never thought the state of California would make it even harder for writers to make a living, but here we are.
To be fair, that's not the Legislature's intention. Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) drafted Assembly Bill 5 to help workers victimized by the gig economy. She consulted with writers' organizations regarding its effect on writers. She deserves a lot of credit for her efforts. But even before AB 5 takes effect on Jan. 1, 2020, the marketplace is making it unworkable for many freelancers.
The new law will require a company to hire as an employee any writer who contributes more than 35 "submissions" a year to that publication. (It applies to editorial cartoonists and photographers as well.)

It's meant to stop media companies from firing full-time staff and replacing them with the work of freelancers, without paying for benefits or payroll taxes.
But it runs into two problems. The first is the changing nature of the writing marketplace; the second is the diversity of writers' careers.
If you're an Uber driver, you can't operate a vehicle from across the continent (not yet, at least). But writing exists in a national marketplace, and most freelance writers can work remotely from wherever they live. Since local stories make up only a small subset of content that is in demand, publishers both in and outside California may well avoid buying work from California-based freelancers. Many freelancers say this is already happening.
AB 5 was written to minimize these effects; for example, multiple stories about the same event may count as a single "submission." But the market doesn't care. Facing ever narrower margins, media companies prefer to avoid the time and cost of parsing the law and any risk of running afoul of it. They can turn to the many good writers who live in the other 49 states.
It's commonly understood that an out-of-state employer must abide by labor laws where the worker resides. It would probably take a court case to settle the jurisdictional issues in AB 5. Would a New York or Washington-based media company risk litigation in order to hire a California freelancer? Unlikely.
The other problem with the law is that it doesn't sufficiently take into account the variety of categories of writers, and how they overlap. The assumption is that we all want a full-time job with an employer.
In some cases, that's true. Gonzalez, a former labor organizer, told the Hollywood Reporter that she was alarmed by the attack on journalists' unions with many reporters having been sacked unwillingly. A lot of freelancers would love to be staff writers.
But writing careers comprise a spectrum. Book authors like myself want to put most of our time into work on our own projects. We retain copyright over our work and the freedom to express our views through our creations.
Of course, only rarely does individual creation pay all the bills. I have two Pulitzer Prizes but no New York Times bestsellers. I, like others, write on a freelance basis as I attempt to put together income from a variety of sources while retaining my independence. Crimping even a minor revenue stream hurts the ability to create.
Many authors I know have had regular gigs writing columns or reviews for daily newspapers. No, they weren't paid enough, but trying to force their papers to hire them wouldn't help.
The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, is not about to create a new position for a full-time reviewer, since it has laid off its book editor.
For many years after I started to write books full time, I supplemented my income by writing catalog and jacket-flap copy for a publisher, often submitting as many as 60 pieces a year.
I don't know if I could have finished my first two books if AB 5 had come along and frightened away that client. Does the new law apply to that kind of marketing work? It might, unless the work "depends primarily on the invention, imagination, or talent of the employee," to quote the text of the law. A hard-pressed manager with a limited budget is unlikely to risk a court case to test this question.
And what if the law worked as intended, and I were offered a job?
No, thank you. I had quit my last job in order to write my own books and I would not want to go back to regular employment in marketing and advertising.
It's a tough time for writers. In a recent member survey, the Authors Guild found that incomes have declined sharply. The digital platform titans of Silicon Valley have remade the creative marketplace for their own profit, slashing pay for artists and writers as they harvest advertising and streaming revenue.
I believe AB 5 is meant to help, but it's not the solution. No matter how precisely drafted, a state-based intervention may simply push our clients to go elsewhere.
Please, revise AB 5 before it hurts writers who are already struggling.

Texto completo: Joe Biden ripped Rudy Giuliani for his role in trying to dig up political dirt on him and his son's dealings in Ukraine while defending Hunter Biden from House Republican calls for him to testify before Congress as part of President Trump's impeachment proceeding.
"There's not been a scintilla of evidence pointing out anything wrong. But there are people around him, like that chump Rudy Giuliani and the thugs that he has working with him," the former vice president said on Monday in Iowa of his family's conduct.
Joe Biden dismissed the suggestion the younger Biden, a 49-year-old lobbyist who earned $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian oligarch-linked energy company while his father spearheaded the Obama administration's foreign policy in the region, should appear on Capitol Hill before impeachment investigators.
“There is zero rationale for that to happen,” Biden said during a town hall televised on CNN. “This is all a diversion. This is classic Trump, classic Trump. Focus on the problem. We have a president who is one of the most corrupt people to serve in that office.”
The television event coincides with the impeachment proceeding's first public hearings, scheduled to start on Wednesday. Investigators are looking into whether Trump improperly leveraged U.S. military aid with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pressure him to examine the Bidens.
Giuliani pushed for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens since at least May, centering on Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company. The former New York mayor-turned-Trump's personal lawyer also wanted an investigation into the elder Biden’s threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans from Ukraine while urging then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
An associate of Giuliani told his lawyer he warned a representative of Zelensky’s government that the Trump administration would stop the flow of security assistance and Vice President Mike Pence would not attend Zelensky's inauguration if the country did not publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens, according to the New York Times this week. Giuliani has denied the allegations. "Categorically, I did not tell him to say that," he told the news outlet.

Joshua Bernstein wants you to drink better beer

Texto completo: Author Joshua M. Bernstein has written five books on craft beer, including “Drink Better Beer," released last month. In addition, Bernstein contributes beer and travel coverage to the New York Times, Men's Journal, and Imbibe.
I recently caught up with Bernstein to discuss his latest book, industry trends, and more.
You write that the release of your last book, in 2013, seems like “sixty-five million years ago." What have been some of the biggest shifts in beer since then? Six years ago, American craft beer was sitting in a hot air balloon that seemed to be soaring ever higher, no end in sight. Bitter IPAs were all the rage, and we bought beer at grocery and liquor stores in bottles, not cans. Now, hazy IPAs that flaunt juicy, tropical aromas and flavors and scant bitterness rule the land, the beers sold in 16-ounce cans directly from taprooms where — why not! — folks might stick around for another round served on site. The biggest shifts are where we buy beer, and where we drink beer.
What are your favorite beer trends right now? I'm psyched to see, slowly and steadily, that brewers are gravitating back toward traditional styles. Look, it's great to make something that tastes like your favorite childhood cereal, a beer to drink once and maybe never again — because it's never brewed again — but I like the trend toward refining pilsners and lagers and other classic styles, served in proper glassware with the right amount of foam on top.
What are your least-favorite trends? There's a beer for everyone, that's for sure. But I'm not the biggest fan of dessert-style stouts that are packed with excess alcohol, sugar, and enough candy bars to stock a corner store. I also have zero sweet tooth, so perhaps this isn't a trend for me, but I don't get excited about beers that I can only sip by the ounce, maybe two. I want to have a full pint and talk to folks, the beer a companion to conversation.
You've got a section on hard seltzer in there. What are your thoughts on that trend? Seltzer, in its booze-free form, is all about bubbly refreshment. It's a guilt-free pleasure. Hard seltzer has borrowed the healthy veneer, offering an of-the-moment mix of low calories, invigorating carbonation, and restrained alcohol content. You can also drink a couple of them, maybe five or six, while sitting at the beach on a sweltering summer day. Will the trend have lasting traction? I don't think we'll be making White Claw memes five years from now. We're always looking for a new flavor of the month. But if you reframe hard seltzer as a premixed, portable vodka soda, then you can see its appeal. If breweries want to make hard seltzer, go for it! It's fermentation. Brewers are good at fermenting things. Brewing is also a business. And as the industry grows more competitive and the taproom model evolves, it's imperative to offer drinks that might tickle everyone's fancy.
I wonder how your own personal beer preferences have changed over the years. When I first dove into beer more than 15 years ago, I used to chase intensities with the best of them, always seeking out flavors that were cranked high. Now, though, I've learned to appreciate beers that speak in whispers and conversational tones, not shouts. I want to get to know a Munich helles lager over several rounds, as well as knock back a couple Czech-style pilsners. Also, I seek out beers with a more moderate ABV. My liver isn't quite as fresh as it once was, and my first-grade daughter wakes up at the same time — 6 a.m. or so — every single day.
You mention London and Brussels as go-to beer destinations. Are there any others that you'd highly recommend? Don't sleep on domestic beer tourism. The great thing about America's brewery boom is that you'll find thriving and compelling scenes anywhere and everywhere. Go to Austin, Texas, and drink your way through the city's pilsners, or travel to Chicago and explore the town's deft integration of beer and food. I was just in Jacksonville, Fla., and I found a bundle of great breweries, many perched in the city's strip malls — the local version of the old abandoned warehouse. From regional flavor preferences to repurposed infrastructure, there's a wealth of amazing beer being made anywhere and everywhere. To experience it, you need to get in a car, plane, or train and drink up the local culture, one pint at a time.
What's the best beer experience you can remember? The day after my daughter was born, I bought a case of Sierra Nevada Celebration, the brewery's annual fresh-hop IPA. I sipped a cold bottle in the hospital while cradling Violet, a touch of bitterness bringing immeasurable joy to that memorable November day.
Bernstein will be at Samuel Adams' Boston brewery for a book event on Nov. 18 from 6 to 8 p.m.

McKinsey Bankruptcy Unit Faces Criminal Probe; Giant consulting firm faces mounting legal and court challenges as it attempts to defend its bankruptcy-advisory business

Texto completo: A McKinsey & Co. unit faces mounting legal and court challenges as the giant consulting firm defends its bankruptcy-advisory business.
Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into whether McKinsey's bankruptcy unit improperly failed to disclose investment interests in companies it was advising in bankruptcy and clients that had ties to those cases, according to people familiar with the matter.
Bankruptcy laws require advisers to troubled companies to be disinterested in the outcomes of chapter 11 cases.
As part of the probe, the people said, prosecutors are examining McKinsey's investing unit, known as MIO Partners. MIO held undisclosed stakes in hedge funds giving it a direct financial interest in the outcome of roughly half of the chapter 11 cases the firm had worked on between 2002 and the end of 2016, according to a 2018 investigation by The Wall Street Journal . In six of the 12 chapter 11 cases in which McKinsey acted as an adviser to the debtors, the Journal found, the firm had a financial interest in the outcome. In 2015, for instance, McKinsey advised Alpha Natural Resources, a troubled coal miner, and didn't disclose its investment in a hedge fund that received valuable Alpha assets in the bankruptcy.
McKinsey's spokesman said Monday that in mid-2018, it received an inquiry from the U.S. attorney's office in New York City. The firm addressed the inquiry and has received no additional requests from the office, the spokesman said.
The chapter 11 bankruptcy process requires advisers to be disinterested advocates for their clients and to disclose all relationships that might give rise to a conflict of interest so that other participants in the cases are aware of them. McKinsey has routinely disclosed far fewer potential conflicts of interest than other bankruptcy professionals over the past decade, the Journal has reported. The McKinsey spokesman said that the firm's disclosures "have always been undertaken in good faith" and have been "entirely lawful and responsive to industry developments." The firm strongly denies that MIO created a conflict of interest with its bankruptcy advisory business, the spokesman said.
The criminal inquiry into McKinsey, first reported in the New York Times, is taking place alongside an investigation into the firm's practices by the U.S. Trustee Program, a unit of the Justice Department charged with protecting the integrity of the bankruptcy system.
Earlier this year, McKinsey agreed to pay $15 million to settle with the U.S. Trustee over three chapter 11 cases it worked on. At the time, the U.S. Trustee said it was continuing to investigate McKinsey and that the settlement didn't foreclose the possibility of criminal charges down the road. The firm did not admit to wrongdoing in connection with the settlement.
The U.S. Trustee has focused on MIO, McKinsey's $12.3 billion investment unit, and in court filings has characterized as inaccurate the firm's sworn testimony that the unit is operated independently from the firm "as a blind trust."
The U.S. Trustee late last year also cited the fact that Jon Garcia, founder of McKinsey's bankruptcy advisory unit, simultaneously sat on the board of MIO Partners for many years and ratified its investment decisions. McKinsey's disclosures about MIO lacked "timely, voluntary, and direct candor," the U.S. Trustee contended.
McKinsey said at the time that its "disclosures in bankruptcy advising fully meet the terms of the U.S. bankruptcy code," adding: "We have been transparent about the connections we were disclosing and the process utilized to identify those connections." Mr. Garcia has declined to comment.
MIO Partners is under scrutiny in the 2018 bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal, another company advised by McKinsey. The U.S. Trustee objected to McKinsey's application to work on the Westmoreland matter, which is being heard in Judge David Jones's Houston courtroom, saying the firm's disclosures were insufficient and at odds with bankruptcy law. McKinsey's spokesman said it is working constructively with the U.S. Trustee in the Westmoreland case.
McKinsey eventually withdrew its first application and submitted another with added disclosures, which the U.S. Trustee says remain "incomplete, inadequate and, in some areas, raise questions."

Scott Hapgood refuses to return to Anguilla amid death threats, possibility of jail

Texto completo: DARIEN — Scott Hapgood did not return to Anguilla Monday for a court appearance, citing safety concerns and the possibility of being sent back to jail.
The 44-year-old Darien man, who is on leave from his job as a UBS trader, has been accused of killing Kenny Mitchel, a hotel worker in April during a violent struggle while on vacation with his family in the Caribbean.
“Despite the unfairness of the charge continuing, Scott has cooperated with the Anguillan legal process and has returned to the island three times for hearings in an effort to clear his name,” said Jamie Diaferia, the Hapgood family spokesman.
“But it has become progressively apparent that Scott would not receive a fair trial in Anguilla. During the process, a toxicology report was suppressed, witnesses altered their accounts and submitted new statements that were false, a revised cause of death was ignored, legal counsel was excluded from the hearing, and numerous other actions that suggested that politics are governing Scott’s case rather than the law and the facts.”

His Monday court appearance was to be a preliminary inquiry and the judge could have revoked Hapgood’s bail, sending him to an Anguilla jail possibly until the case is resolved.
Hapgood was originally held at Her Majesty’s Prison in Anguilla when he was denied bail. But he was later released on bond after his attorney appealed to the High Court, sparking outrage among residents on the island. The judge who denied Hapgood’s bail in April was also scheduled to preside over Monday’s hearing.
“The guarantees of safety are essential for two reasons,” Diaferia said. “First, there is a significant likelihood Scott’s incarceration would be indefinite, as a trial may not happen for many years. Second, there is near certainty the death threats he has received will come to fruition if he were to be held in an Anguillan prison for any length of time.”
A spokesman at the Royal Anguilla Police Force said “the matter has been adjourned” until Tuesday and declined further comment.
The Royal Anguilla Police Force had issued a traffic advisory for the area near the Magistrate Court.
“This adjustment has become necessary in order to facilitate operational commitments by the Royal Anguilla Police Force,” the advisory said.
Though it did not indicate it was related to Hapgood’s court appearance, a Facebook page dedicated to defending Mitchel posted the notice with the comment, “We are preparing for his arrival.”
Another person commented, “Wow, what a beautiful welcoming...”
Diaferia said Anguilla authorities declined to guarantee Hapgood’s safety and also refused to allow him to appear at the hearing by video.
“An inflammatory and false rhetoric has also grown around this case,” Diaferia said. “Scott was accused of perpetrating racial violence.”
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children after Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink. Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
The family has accused Mitchel of pulling a knife, resulting in Hapgood “fighting for his life” and being bitten multiple times, including on the face.
Darien Police respond
“The Darien Police Department has been advised that Scott Hapgood, a Darien resident charged with manslaughter on the island of Anguilla, was scheduled to return to the island today, November 11, 2019, for a court appearance,” Darien Police Chief Donald Anderson said.
“We have been further advised that Mr. Hapgood, in consultation with his legal advisers, has made the decision to not return to Anguilla at this time amid reported concerns for his personal safety,” Anderson said.
The Darien Police Department statement said it had no direct involvement in these ongoing proceedings which have attracted national and international media attention during the year.
“The Darien Police Department, as always, looks to provide an effective public safety response and to ensure that the rights to safety and security, afforded to all residents and guests of the Town of Darien, are protected should our services be required. Our staff is aware of these latest developments in this matter and we will continue to provide reasonable, professional patrol (both general and focused) and effective response to ensure public safety,” Anderson said.
“Going forward, it appears that these ongoing criminal matters will most likely be handled at the United States Department of State level as it involves international criminal charges and a citizen of the United States and the State of Connecticut,” Anderson said.
The Darien Police Department will have no further comment on this matter at this time, they said.
A revised autopsy report, based on recently released toxicology tests, determined Mitchel died from a lethal dose of cocaine and not from injuries he sustained in the fight, according to The New York Times.
“Acute cocaine toxicity could have been a potentially independent cause of death in the known circumstances,” according to Dr. Stephen King, who oversaw the autopsy.
The report described cocaine levels in Mitchel’s bloodstream “twice that commonly accepted to have a fatal outcome,” causing his lungs to fill with blood and suffocating him.
A separate analysis of the new autopsy, conducted at the request of Hapgood’s lawyers by the Chief Medical Examiner for the state of Maryland, led to a similar finding.
The revised report supports the defense’s claim Mitchel was allegedly behaving erratically and aggressively — common side effects for that level of drug use. Hapgood has said Mitchel threatened him with a knife and demanded money. Mitchel’s blood also had alcohol levels at twice the legal limit.
“We understand there will be people in Anguilla who say Scott is running from a trial. That is 100 percent false,” his international lawyer Juliya Arbisman wrote in a statement on Monday. “There is nothing Scott wants more than to clear his name and get his life back. But he cannot clear his name if he is dead, or if the legal process by which he is bound is fundamentally biased and unjust.”
Widespread support
The support for Hapgood has spread beyond Darien with federal lawmakers and even President Donald Trump coming to his defense.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among about 100 people who gathered last month, rallying support for Hapgood outside of Darien Town Hall. Last week, Blumenthal and other federal lawmakers, including Sens. Chris Murphy, and Lindsey Graham, and U.S. Rep Jim Himes, sent a letter to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to express their concerns for Hapgood’s “safety and fair treatment.”
In a statement released Monday, Blumenthal said refusing to return to Anguilla was a “difficult decision” for the Hapgood family.
“This difficult decision was for the family to make, and only the family could fully assess the personal risks and uncertainties,” Blumenthal said. “I worked with Senate colleagues and the State Department in seeking to assure Scott Hapgood’s physical safety and fair, transparent legal proceedings. The State Department had discussions with British and Anguillan authorities. I continue to stand ready to help the Hapgood family in any appropriate way.”
Hapgood’s story was featured last month on Fox & Friends and Trump tweeted afterward that he would look into the case.
“Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla,” Trump tweeted. “Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!”
The family has released statements, thanking the president and federal lawmakers for their support in recent weeks.
Although we are all concerned about Scott’s safety in Anguilla, it is reassuring to have our government behind us in such a public and steadfast way,” the family said in a statement released last week after the letter was sent to Pompeo.

Texto completo: WMFE's space podcast "Are We There Yet?" is exploring a new frontier as a weekly radio series.
Space reporter Brendan Byrne will host the half-hour show at 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays, starting Nov. 12. It will air on 90.7 WMFE and sister station 89.5 WMFV in The Villages.
"For the first show, we'll be talking with retired NASA astronaut Nicole Stott about the milestone, all-female spacewalk," Bryne said. "What does this mean for gender diversity in the astronaut corps?"
On Nov. 19, the show will look at NASA's Voyager 2 mission. "It recently punched through the boundary of interstellar space after more than 40 years of flying through the solar system," Byrne said. "New York Times science reporter Kenneth Chang brings us up to speed on how the science is changing the way we think about our solar system."
The Nov. 26 show features author and SpaceX engineer Andrew Rader, who discusses the history of human exploration. The topic extends from the cavemen to the exploration of other worlds, Byrne said.
The radio show will air first, then be published as a podcast. "Subscribers to the podcast will get extra content like extended interviews from the on-air show and bonus guest interviews," Byrne said.
WMFE debuted "Are We There Yet?" in 2016, and Byrne has interviewed scientists, engineers, leaders and visionaries. The podcast has focused on Space Coast, NASA and private industry companies. It has listeners in 123 countries and about 35,000 episode downloads each month.
Byrne's space reporting has been heard frequently on NPR's "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered."
"There's an appetite for space news here in Central Florida, and the move to the FM dial is a way to feed that appetite of our listeners' curiosity," Byrne said.
The program will feature listener questions in the segment "I'd Like to Know." Each week, Byrne will chat with UCF planetary scientists Josh Colwell, Addie Dove and Jim Cooney. Listeners can submit questions at AreWeThereYet@wmfe.org.
"Are We There Yet?" will air in the former time slot of "Friends Talking Faith." That series went on hiatus after the Rev. Bryan Fulwider, one of the hosts, was arrested last month on charges of sexual battery on a minor. Fulwider later took his life while out on bail.

*"ARE WE THERE YET?" The show will be hosted by space reporter Brendan Byrne. The half-hour show starts at 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays, starting Nov. 12. It will air on 90.7 WMFE and sister station 89.5 WMFV in The Villages.

Texto completo: Says women in politics are likely to be held to 'a different standard'
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.
Klobuchar's comments mark the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fundraising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.
They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden's description last week of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as 'angry' and antagonistic.
In an interview on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Klobuchar, who is serving her third term in the Senate, described herself as 'the one from the Midwest that's actually won in a statewide race over and over again,' adding, 'That's not true of Mayor Pete.'
A New York Times article on Saturday quoted Klobuchar as saying this summer that she doubts people would take any of the female presidential candidates seriously if they were running with the same qualifications as Buttigieg.
Klobuchar also recently declined to say whether she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be president, the Times reported.
Asked Sunday about those comments, Klobuchar clarified that she does believe Buttigieg is qualified but that she is the better candidate.
'The last point I made in that article was that, of the women on the stage " I'm focusing here on my fellow women senators, Senator Harris, Senator Warren and myself " do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard,' Klobuchar said on CNN.
Buttigieg's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the third quarter of the year, Buttigieg raised $19.1 million for his presidential bid, a haul that put him third behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised $25.3-million, and Warren, who raised $24.6 million. Klobuchar raised $4.8 million in the same period.
Recent polls show Buttigieg gaining ground on Biden, Warren and Sanders, particularly in Iowa, whose caucuses in February mark the first nominating contest of the 2020 primary race. Klobuchar has remained in the single digits.
The Minnesota Democrat's remarks come as Warren has also spoken out against what she views as a double standard against women on the campaign trail.
Last week, Biden accused Warren of holding an 'angry, unyielding viewpoint' " language that some decried as sexist.
Warren, who has typically pursued a strategy of ignoring her fellow Democrats' attacks, responded Friday, saying in an email to supporters, 'I'm angry and I own it.'
'Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,' Warren said in the email. 'It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.'

On this date:
In 1775, the U.S. Marines were organized under authority of the Continental Congress.
In 1944, during World War II, the ammunition ship USS Mount Hood (AE-11) exploded while moored at the Manus Naval Base in the Admiralty Islands in the South Pacific, leaving 45 confirmed dead and 327 missing and presumed dead.
In 1954, the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, depicting the raising of the American flag on Iwo Jima in 1945, was dedicated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Arlington, Virginia.
In 1969, the children’s educational program “Sesame Street” made its debut on National Educational Television (later PBS).
In 1975, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution equating Zionism with racism (the world body repealed the resolution in December 1991).
In 1982, the newly finished Vietnam Veterans Memorial was opened to its first visitors in Washington, D.C., three days before its dedication. Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev died at age 75.
In 2017, facing allegations of sexual misconduct, comedian Louis C.K. said the harassment claims by five women that were detailed in a New York Times report “are true,” and he expressed remorse for using his influence “irresponsibly.”
Ten years ago: John Allen Muhammad, mastermind of the 2002 sniper attacks that killed 10 in the Washington, D.C. region, was executed.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama, at the start of a visit to Beijing, announced the United States and China would start granting visas to each other’s citizens valid for up to a decade.
One year ago: President Donald Trump, in France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, canceled a visit to a cemetery east of Paris where Americans killed in that war are buried; rainy weather had grounded the presidential helicopter.

Eliminate The Racism From Health Care Algorithms

Texto completo: Machine learning algorithms have quietly seeped into the world of health care, to the point that automated systems sometimes make life-or-death decisions. The trend seems inevitable as medicine becomes more complex and costly. But there are downsides.
Last month, for example, researchers found a substantial racial bias in an algorithm that decides who needs extra care to avoid costly emergency room visits. This may seem surprising, given that the algorithm didn’t take any racial data into consideration. But it did rely on historical data, and there’s racism embedded in history, as well as fallible human assumptions that inevitably go into the making of algorithms and interpretation of their output.
Government and private insurance programs are increasingly adopting algorithms and artificial intelligence to predict our future health care needs. Last spring, at a conference, Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain compared artificial intelligence to asbestos. “It turns out that it’s all over the place, even though at no point did you explicitly install it,” he said. And by the time we recognize any potential dangers, it’s hard to remove.
In the paper on racial bias, published in the Oct. 25 issue of Science, the researchers wrote that they had access to additional data, including the self-reported race of people in the database. And what they found was that those who identified as black were much less likely to be included in the group targeted for extra care than white patients of similar health status.
The system was created with good intentions, said lead author Ziad Obermeyer, a health policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. It was adopted in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act to direct medical attention to those most in need, thus both avoiding pain and suffering and saving money.
The race problem isn’t rooted in the algorithm itself, but in the way people have used it. The algorithm was predicting not future health status but future health costs, using data on people’s past health costs.
But patients who identify as black have historically received less health care than patients of equal health status who identify as white. The system was therefore less likely to flag black patients as eligible for extra preventive care, simply because less had been spent on their health care in the past. The crux of the problem was in the assumption that health needs were equal to health costs.
This same sort of bias has been found in algorithms used in the criminal justice system. There, the problem also stems from the fact that they don’t predict what people think they predict. Though advertised as predicting future crime, it is more accurate to say they predict future arrests. And yet, there is a growing body of evidence that racial bias affects who gets stopped by police, who gets arrested and whose charges are more likely to be dropped.
Writing a commentary to accompany the health algorithm paper, Princeton African American Studies professor Ruha Benjamin illustrated the problem with a stark hypothetical case involving the real historical figure Henrietta Lacks. In the real story, Lacks came to Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s with symptoms of cervical cancer. She was sent to what was known as the Negro ward, where her care was cheaper. She ultimately died from the disease.
In the hypothetical case, with a machine in charge, the same bias would be encoded, because the algorithm would use cost as a proxy for health, and would misinterpret her past low health care costs. “On the basis of those results, she would be discharged, her health would deteriorate, and by the time she returns, the cancer has spread and she dies.”
Benjamin wrote that she’s concerned that most algorithms used in health care, housing and employment aren’t transparent, and so it could be impossible for researchers to find what might be substantial racial biases. Obermeyer, the lead author of the study, said that the case they researched was unique in that the algorithm was public, along with all the data on the patients, as well as the additional data on race and health conditions.
He was able to fix the algorithm so that it measured health rather than health costs - and as a result, the number of self-identified black patients deemed eligible for additional care doubled.
Getting rid of algorithms altogether isn’t practical, and could cause more harm than good. In a 2017 commentary for the New England Journal of Medicine, Obermeyer wrote that medicine had become far too complex for the human mind to handle without the help of machines.
What we could work to improve is the lack of transparency. The complexity of the human body is nothing compared to the complexity of the health care billing codes, which have spawned an industry of experts in using them to maximize billing. Something as simple as weighing a patient during an office visit, or, more ominously, prescribing opioids, can drive up billing, as physician and former drug executive Mike MaGee writes in his book, “Code Blue: Inside America’s Medical Industrial Complex.”
In 2016, when I wrote about crime algorithms that were already being used in Philadelphia, one of the creators of the system, University of Pennsylvania Professor Richard Berk, worried that people would put too much faith in its predictions. The danger in mixing medicine and algorithms might also lie in the trust that algorithms engender, creating a false picture of simplicity, efficiency and objectivity that papers over a system that’s inherently convoluted, overpriced and unfair.

A PITTSBURGH NATIVE WRITES BOOK ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM (AND ITS DISCONTENTS)

Texto completo: After October 2018's deadly shooting, Bari Weiss wrote several moving pieces about her childhood experiences in the Tree of Life synagogue for The New York Times where she's a writer and editor. She then spent a year writing "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," a slim book in which she defines her opponent as "an ever-morphing conspiracy theory in which Jews play the starring role in spreading evil."
Ms. Weiss argues that growing global inequality poses a risk to Jews, whom populists are eager to blame for economic downturns and crises. In the conclusion, Ms. Weiss provides useful strategies for confronting anti-Semitism. Throughout, Ms. Weiss expertly explains how Jews often "occupy the duplicitous middle"; they appear white yet frustrate white supremacists because they are "slavishly loyal to those at the bottom."
'Slavishly' is a clumsy word choice, but there isn't time to parse adverbs when there are, unfortunately, more pressing problems in this sloppy book about the evil that has quite recently terrorized our city.
I'm uneasy writing that last sentence. I recognize that many readers - particularly younger ones - may find this book to be an important introduction to an overlooked chronology. For Ms. Weiss, the shooting served as a wake-up call, revealing that "I had spent much of my life on a holiday from history."
The problem is that Ms. Weiss is very much on holiday throughout this book. She regularly directs readers elsewhere ("Others far wiser and more knowledgeable than I have written books about .," "Many others can give you chapter and verse ."). A generous interpretation is that she's providing a syllabus, although she infrequently names or quotes from these authors.
The more you read, the more you realize she has an allergy to context. Jeremy Corbyn has transformed the British Labour Party "into a hub of Jew hatred," but Ms. Weiss doesn't explain how. In Oslo, "a rapper asked if there were any Jews in the crowd" before disparaging them, and that's the entirety of the setup: "a rapper." She writes as though she wants her arguments to be un-Google-able.
Let me emphasize: This history is vital. The book is accessible. It wants to be read alongside Ta-Nehisi Coates' "Between the World and Me" and Valeria Luiselli's "Tell Me How it Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions."
But whereas Mr. Coates can lean on his experience as a reporter and memoirist when describing black parenthood, and whereas Ms. Luiselli can rely on her experiences as a novelist and translator when depicting the immigration crisis, Ms. Weiss lacks a go-to move. The result is a book that reads like op-eds stitched together with Wikipedia (consecutive paragraphs start "In 1984.," "In 1999.," "On April 28, 2000."). Structurally, her repeated "Anti-Zionists will say." line starts to sound like a Jeff Foxworthy bit about rednecks.
Worse yet, Ms. Weiss is alarmingly eager to simplify issues rather than explore their complexity. Take this question: Was President Trump culpable for the political atmosphere that produced Robert Bowers, the accused murderer of 11 Jews at Tree of Life last year?
The answer was "yes" for the thousands who marched in Squirrel Hill after the shooting to protest the president's visit. It was "yes" for the tens of thousands who signed an online petition arguing that the violence was "a direct culmination" of the president's influence. Ditto 72% of Jewish respondents in a J Street survey taken a week after the shooting.
It would be reasonable to counter that it's hard to draw a straight line between ideas and actions, between atmosphere and event, particularly with the internet filtering every social transaction.
But Ms. Weiss manages to avoid this debate entirely. She instead explores a literal reading of the president's post-shooting commentary, suggesting that he gave "a full-throated condemnation of the act, which revealed an understanding of anti-Semitism." She entertains the notion that because Mr. Bowers wrote about his displeasure with the president, the president and the political atmosphere he created cannot be considered an influence in his behavior.
Perplexingly, Ms. Weiss writes these paragraphs from the vaguely "imagined" perspective of "Trump-supporting Jews." So: None of those bad takes are technically "hers." It's a mystifying move, all in the name of avoiding extended interaction with a quoted human perspective.
It's worth noting that Jewish writers have published outstanding criticism of this book. I'd advise tracking down reviews from Talia Lavin, Jordan Weissmann and Judith Butler. They all admirably grapple with a tricky paradox: No Jew should ever be labeled as having a "disproportionate" response to anti-Semitism . yet each writer cannot ignore that Ms. Weiss' text regularly invites a form of this critique.

Texto completo: Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com . Include your name and location, even if you want them withheld. Letters may be edited.
Good morning! It's me and I'm here: your new Work Friend, assembled from the frantically selected parts of expired Work Friends. Choire Sicha's blog-hardened heart; Megan Greenwell's Millennial fortitude; Katy Lederer's unorthodox spelling of "Katie" -- all are united in the hideous yet undeniably proportionate form of me, a Millennial former blogger named Caity.
Like the monster of Victor Frankenstein's creation, I have spent years learning to be human by eavesdropping and spying on strangers at work -- and occasionally enumerating all my complaints in dramatic personal confrontations. As the creature beseeched his creator for a mate, so do I know what it is to simultaneously resent and remain beholden to a supervisor. The moment the doctor achieved his objective, he fled from his responsibility; several of my own bosses have lacked formal management training because of the deeply disorganized nature of media promotions.
For the next six months, I will confidently answer your questions without betraying the true depraved depths of my innermost thoughts -- a skill I honed as a fitting-room attendant at Marshalls. I will analyze your co-worker disputes with the panache of one who has made lifelong companions and enemies both in offices and while working from home. I will prise you from the rigor-mortis grip of your anxieties and tell you what time of day to email people. (8:50 a.m. Prewrite the email the day before and schedule a delayed send.) (Contact me if you don't know how.) As Frankenstein's dæmon famously menaced him, I will even "be with you on your wedding-night" -- provided your wedding night is directly relevant to some employment conundrum.
All I ask in return is that you submit questions about your real-life life to workfriend@nytimes.com.
Phantom Dread
I've recently started a contract position with the opportunity for eventual full-time employment. My previous contract consisted of short-term assignments with weeks or months of no work at all, and this new position has minimum quotas for daily production.
I had a panic attack, complete with puking in the lav. How do I relax and do my work in those moments when I think I don't measure up? I believe my work is fine.
-- C.P., Illinois
When I feel anxious, I draw comfort from the high probability that our planet will one day be engulfed by the sun.
But let's analyze your situation through the lens of a biological truth: Humans hate change.
You got so nervous about starting a new job that you threw up. Not ideal, but also not unheard-of. Humans hate change so much that sometimes the sheer fear of it makes our bodies go haywire. This is why we are all unfit for work of any kind.
As for your unease about the future, let's assume the worst: that you are a terrible worker, totally unfit for the job, who should be fired immediately. The odds you will be are low, because humans hate change. Not only would the bosses have to cast about for your replacement, and do that person's new hire paperwork, and process your outgoing paperwork -- they would also have to fire you, which is an unpleasant activity many cowards will go out of their way to avoid.
You say you believe your work is fine, but worry about negative thoughts. Listen to me -- the words you are reading right now? I hate them. I regret my decision to select these specific ones from the rich English lexicon and am embarrassed at the idiotic way I have chosen to arrange them into these sentences. My worst possible fate is being buried alive while also burning to death slowly, and the second worst is hearing someone read these paragraphs back to me aloud. But the fact is, they're probably fine. (By which I mean they're definitely terrible, but the average person will probably think that they're fine, because the only person on Earth who actually understands what is good is me, which is an awful burden to have.)
If you can overcome your self-doubt enough to say you believe your work is fine, there's a good chance it's actually better than fine. If it's not, fine is good enough in most cases. It's not your job to tell yourself you aren't doing well; it's your bosses' job, and they are paid more money than you are to do it.
Snitches Get Kisses
An ex-employee of the company where I work is under consideration for a new job at a wonderful place. He is a perfect fit for the position. The problem is that the hiring manager at the new job is calling around, asking why the ex-employee left in the first place. The actual answer is that someone in management, who subsequently left, simply hated his guts. There is no real way to reveal that without ignoring the informal company norm of simply verifying that he worked here from date X to date Y. What is the ethical thing to do?
-- Anonymous
If the most blisteringly honest thing you can say about someone is that they would be a perfect fit for a wonderful company, you have no ethical obligation to keep this secret from the world. I make it a point to say kind things about people behind their backs. It promotes a feel-good atmosphere and, if word ever gets back to them, I assume I look like a hero and that they can't stop crying.
Whether the call is for basic due diligence or an attempt to dig up dirt (by a wonderful company?), you can reasonably respond to it with something like, "I remember him fondly. He worked here from date X to date Y," and maybe top it off with your observation that this job sounds like a great fit. It's possible to both remain professional and do him a good turn without sharing the plotlines of your workplace's psychological melodramas. These should be emailed directly to me at workfriend@nytimes.com.

Texto completo: A federal judge rejected U.S. Soccer's argument that no discrimination existed. Megan Rapinoe praised the decision as a validation of their campaign.
The judge overseeing the United States women's national soccer team's gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer granted the players class status on Friday, an important victory for the women that appeared to support the claim that they are subjected to unequal working conditions and unequal pay when they played games for their country.
The players had sought class-action status in September by arguing that the working conditions and compensation they were contesting applied not only to the 28 named plaintiffs, but also to any woman who had appeared in a national team camp or game over the multiyear period specified in the suit.
Friday's ruling by the judge, R. Gary Klausner of United States District Court for the Central District of California, drew no conclusions on whether the players' allegations against the federation were true, or whether U.S. Soccer had acted in violation of federal law; it merely noted that the players had sufficiently met the burden to be treated as a class rather than as individuals.
The players have been making their case for equal pay from U.S. Soccer for several years, as the leading edge in a wider fight by female athletes -- not just in soccer -- for equal treatment. In track and field, the Olympians Alysia Montaño, Kara Goucher and Allyson Felix disclosed to The New York Times that they had faced reduced compensation from their shoe sponsors for having children. Their revelations led Nike to adjust some of its policies.
In women's soccer, the world's best player, Ada Hegerberg of Norway, skipped last summer's Women's World Cup in part to protest what she said was her federation's lack of support for the women's program. And just this week, Australia's men's and women's teams reached a landmark deal that guaranteed the teams equal shares of revenue, though not equal compensation over all.
American players initially took on U.S. Soccer through a wage-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and later in their gender-discrimination lawsuit. Friday's ruling was received by the players as the clearing an important legal hurdle and as a validation of their equal-pay campaign, according to Megan Rapinoe, one of the team's captains and a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
"Sometimes it's just nice for someone to say, 'I believe you and I am validating what you've been saying,"' Rapinoe said in a telephone interview. "We have an internal belief in what we're doing. But to have someone, and in this case someone very important in this case, say, 'I believe what you're saying,' is very important."
In granting class status, the judge effectively rejected U.S. Soccer's argument that, because many of the women had earned more than the top-earning men's players over that period, there could be no discrimination under federal law.
"Defendant cites no case law to support this premise," Klausner wrote in his decision.
Klausner went even further, though, writing that agreeing with U.S. Soccer's argument defending the current pay structure could yield an "absurd result" in which a woman could be paid half as much as a man as long as she overcame the disparity by working twice as many hours.
"Nice try," Rapinoe said acidly of the federation's argument. "No one bought it."
U.S. Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the judge's decision. It has argued from the beginning, both publicly and in court filings, that any differences in compensation between the men's and women's national teams are the result of differing pay structures in the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the players on each team.
One immediate result of Friday's ruling is that it could push U.S. Soccer and the players to restart efforts to find an out-of-court resolution to the lawsuit. When federation's president, Carlos Cordeiro, introduced the new coach of the women's national team at a news conference in New York late last month, he strongly hinted that he would be open to such a resolution.
"I'd say we're still very committed to resolving this, and in a fair way," he said, adding, "Give us some more time, but that's where were hopefully headed, in that direction."
In August, Klausner had surprised both sides by setting a May 2020 trial date, an accelerated timeline that could see the team's bid for equal pay become entangled with its preparations for next summer's Tokyo Olympics.
Rapinoe would not say if the players would be open to a new round of mediation after a first attempt failed in August, but she would not rule it out, either.
'We're the only team they can have, they're the only federation we can have," she said, "I mean, everybody's here. If the conversation can move forward, if we get further along in the process, potentially we can get back together. But we're going to need to see quite a bit more."

Texto completo: Several elite runners said they had similar struggles with body shaming and should have done more to support Cain at the Nike Oregon Project under Salazar.
Nike said on Friday it would investigate the "deeply troubling" allegations of emotional and physical abuse made by Mary Cain against its Oregon Project, a distance-running training program.
In a video for The New York Times Opinion, published on Thursday, Cain accused the project's director, the marathon great Alberto Salazar, of repeatedly urging her to lose weight to unhealthy levels.
Salazar was recently suspended for four years for antidoping violations, and the Nike Oregon Project was shut down. Salazar has denied giving athletes performance-enhancing drugs.
Nike also said in a statement that "Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process."
Cain was a high school middle distance phenom from New York, qualifying for the Olympic Trials in 2012 at 16. Later that year, she began training with Salazar and continued to do so until 2015. Her later performances on the track did not match her early promise.
In the video, Cain, 23, accused Salazar of shaming her in front of others on the team when she did not reach the required weight targets. She said that her low weight caused her to miss her period for three years, leading to lower levels of estrogen and five broken bones.
She also said that she had suicidal thoughts and cut herself, but that no one at Nike "really did anything or said anything."
Salazar replied to Cain's video in a statement to The Oregonian: "Neither of her parents, nor Mary, raised any of the issues that she now suggests occurred while I was coaching her. To be clear, I never encouraged her, or worse yet, shamed her, to maintain an unhealthy weight."
In a Twitter message on Friday morning, Cain acknowledged that she had sought to reconnect with Salazar.
"I wanted closure, wanted an apology for never helping me when I was cutting, and in my own, sad, never-fully healed heart, wanted Alberto to still take me back," she wrote. "I still loved him. Because when we let people emotionally break us, we crave more than anything their very approval."
"We quickly fell out of touch this summer," she added, "and that made the rose color glasses finally fall off. He didn't care about me as a person; only as the product, the performer, the athlete."
Cain received support on social media from other runners.
"I had no idea it was this bad," tweeted Shalane Flanagan, the 2017 New York City Marathon winner. "I'm so sorry, @runmarycain that I never reached out to you when I saw you struggling. I made excuses to myself as to why I should mind my own business. We let you down. I will never turn my head again."
Amy Yoder Begley, a former American Olympian, tweeted that she was kicked out of the Oregon Project after finishing sixth in the 10,000 meters at the United States track and field championships.
"I was told I was too fat and 'had the biggest butt on the starting line,"' she wrote, "This brings those painful memories back."
Kara Goucher, another American Olympian who used to train with the Oregon Project, said on Twitter, "I have stories to match all of Mary's claims and so much more."

Texto completo: Thousands of books were here, there and everywhere as Severna Park resident Maggie Cullman and Pasadena residents Stacey Hilder and Cathy Crowley were in the final stages of organizing them for the American Association of University Women's annual book sale on Oct. 30. The sale is AAUW's major fundraiser supporting scholarships for women.
Used book dealers invited from Baltimore, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Georgia had come and gone.
But there was still much to do prior to a reception for AAUW members, family and friends that evening. A three-day sale to the public would follow from Oct. 31 through Sunday.
Cullman, Hilder and Crowley breathed a sigh of relief as they placed the last of the books on shelves in a section marked "Thrillers". Neatly printed signs marked every section and price lists were posted.
Volunteers' work began the morning of Oct. 25, as used books collected over several months were trucked from donated storage spaces in Jeannie Hahn's Severna Park garage and at Easy Storage in Arnold to a donated Festival at Pasadena storefront.
The scene inside the storefront was hectic as AAUW members scrambled to deal with multiple loads. Movers carried in box after box of books, piling them from floor to ceiling in a back room and on the main floor.
Unpacking and arranging them continued every day from 9 am to 7 pm through October 30 with 37 AAUW volunteers and 11 guest helpers taking turns emptying boxes.
"Guest helpers included husbands, brothers and grandsons - anyone fit for heavy lifting," Crowley said. "When finished, we had a backroom full of empty boxes."
Book accumulation activities for 2019 began in July when AAUW members marched in the Severna Park Independence Day Parade and handed out bookmarks advertising collection days at sites in Annapolis, Arnold and Severna Park. They also personally picked up volumes from community residents wishing to donate their collections.
"These days, we're getting more books and people are buying more books so it takes us a full five days to unpack and organize," Cullman said. "A gentleman donated 7,000 books to us this year."
Deciding where to place books was challenging for volunteers. There were sections marked for children, youth, and teens and for science fiction, history, religion and health. There was a huge section for cookbooks.
A separate room boasting floor-to-ceiling shelving units marked "Thrillers" contained hardbacks from New York Times bestselling mystery writers like Robert B. Parker, Michael Connelly, David Baldacci and John Grisham plus action-adventure writers like Tom Clancey.
In addition, tables of paperback versions overflowed onto the floor.
The 6:30 pm reception was meant as a thank you to members who volunteered and as an invitation for 100 plus AAUW members to shop ahead of the official sale days. Hilder's son David and granddaughter Allison, a fourth-grader at St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal School, arrived early. Both were guest helpers. Cullman's husband David turned up as well and said he enjoyed volunteering.
"I find it fascinating to open one of the boxes," he said. "It's like a person's whole history is exposed through the contents of the box...their interests, their religion, their health."
Price lists revealed that, for adults and teens, hardback books were $2, soft/trade books $1.50 and paperbacks $1. Children's large or hardback books were $1 and small books were 50¢.
So kids like Morgan Kokalis, who came with dad Darren, got lots of books. She had an armload when AAUW member Carolyn Kokalis - her grandmother - arrived with her aunt Debbie McKenzie and handed her an 11th book, "Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook for Children".
Amber Kaltz's son Nathan happily chose a book in the teen section called "Wildlife Preserves". Amber, communications coordinator for St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal Church, helped with the book sale for three years before becoming an AAUW member.
"I eventually joined because I so love the sale and what the organization does with the funds raised," she said.
The day after the sale, Crowley reported a high volume of sales with traffic good all week.
"We moved more books than ever," she said. "Proceeds will fund scholarships for girls and women to Anne Arundel Community College and our Women to Women program for individuals returning to the workplace or opening businesses."
Removal Day on Monday saw BIG (Books for International Goodwill) coming to pick up remaining non-fiction books. The rest were bundled by helpers like member Coleen Kane's husband Tom and trucked to used book buyer Wonder Books in Hagerstown, Maryland.

AAUW member Amber Kaltz and son Nathan browsed the "Teen" section where the science and nature-oriented youngster selected the book "Wildlife Preserves." Amber volunteered to work the annual book sale for the past three years.

Trump-style campaign tactics may not work for billionaire Bloomberg

Texto completo: With his expected late entry to the Democratic presidential primary, Michael Bloomberg hopes that he can find success by breaking campaign norms — something that fellow wealthy businessman President Trump proved was possible during his 2016 campaign.
But that may not be so easy for Bloomberg, New York City's mayor for 12 years starting in 2002, and a multi-billionaire through his eponymous financial services information and news company.
While Trump built a new coalition and subverted traditional Republican policy messaging with his combative personality, he entered the race relatively early and spent many months building campaign infrastructure before the first primary contests.
“Trump behaves in an unconventional way and frankly, unacceptable, but he ran a traditional campaign. He competed in a pretty traditional way,” said Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh.
Bloomberg, 77, has the money to build a campaign team before the Feb. 3rd Iowa caucuses but little time to do so. And without 200,000 unique donors, he would not qualify for the December primary debate, a threshold that may increase for future debates. Bloomberg might not accept campaign contributions, according to Axios.
Bloomberg, unlike Trump, also has a conventional political background and history of supporting within liberal advocacy groups.
“He was a mayor for 12 years. He has a long track record of funding and leadership on a variety of public policy issues,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network and New Policy Institute. “He's not an outsider businessman. He's already made the transition to being a politician a long time ago.”

That history could be a liability for liberal activists energized by drastically changing political and economic structures. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls — including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires — have condemned a potential Bloomberg run and accused him of trying to buy the presidency.
Bloomberg, though, appears to be hoping to capture more moderate voters. Last month, he reportedly indicated he would consider a presidential bid if former Vice President Joe Biden appeared unable to win.
A New York Times/Siena College poll of Democrats in six key battleground states released Friday found voters preferred a centrist candidate who could work across the aisle with Republicans. The survey suggests the 2020 Democratic primary field is fertile ground for a Bloomberg-like contender as pundits question the durability of Biden’s campaign.
Bloomberg’s history and influence could provide a boost to his candidacy.
“He is a far more formidable politician than people really understand,” Rosenberg said. “He might surprise people with the amount of support he gets from allied groups and other politicians in the early stages.”
But Marsh said that Bloomberg’s approach of swooping in to pick up support from a faltering Biden and other less liberal candidates like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is “flawed.”
“That's now how the process works. And it's not where the Democratic primary and the party is today,” Marsh said.
Other candidates have spent months appealing to voters in early primary and caucus states, where election results can quickly change the course of the primary. A March Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll found Bloomberg with a negative 11% net favorability rating among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa.
“He is not a great fit for these early states, and he's gonna have a lot of work to do to succeed there,” Rosenberg said.

SAFE Banking Act shouldn't harm children

Texto completo: The marijuana industry is lobbying hard for the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (SAFE) of 2019. Its stated purpose is “to increase public safety by ensuring access to financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses.”
The bill’s supporters say it will increase safety for marijuana businesses that now rely on cash because, while some states have legalized marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law.
No one would argue against supporting the safety of employees at marijuana businesses. What’s been lost in the congressional debate over the bill so far, however, is the safety of children.
We have seen the damage when an industry gets ahead of the regulators. Currently, there are over 2,050 cases of lung injury and 39 deaths in the vaping epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that “most patients report using THC-containing products.” The vaping deaths include a 17-year-old boy, and CNN reported on an 18-year-old who doctors said now has lungs like “a 70-year-old’s."
Passing such an expansive marijuana bill seems premature. Yet, should Congress take this major step towards legitimizing the marijuana industry, as this bill would do, now is the time to build in safeguards to limit marijuana’s known harms to children.
One of the major stories about legal, commercial marijuana is the dramatic increase in the potency of today’s marijuana products — and the implications that has for the health of today’s youth. THC is marijuana’s main psychoactive chemical, and it poses significant risks to youth whose brains are still developing.
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams has warned, “Recent increases in access to marijuana and in its potency, along with misperceptions of safety of marijuana endanger our most precious resource, our nation’s youth.”
In Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, commercial sales launched a THC arms race with exponentially rising potency levels.
THC potency nationally averaged around 2% in the 1980s and about 3.8% in the 1990s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Colorado reports that marijuana concentrates have increased to an average of 68.6% THC, and flower strains can now exceed 34% THC, according to High Times magazine.
The risk of vaping to teens is especially worrisome because the new marijuana products are easily concealed from parents and educators. One high-THC product in Colorado looks like an asthma relief inhaler, and others include powders dissolved in water bottles.
Colorado’s most recent survey of youth found an increase in children using marijuana edibles, vaping, and dabbing, a method of smoking ultra-potent THC resin. The survey shows that, while marijuana stores can’t sell to youth, teens are getting marijuana from an informal network of dealers, friends, and family.
Colorado’s youth health statistics are becoming increasingly worrisome, as well. Colorado youth suicide rates are now nearly double the national average, with THC being the number one substance found in toxicology reports of youth ages 10-19.
Because of the risks of ultra-potent marijuana, as documented by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who ate a marijuana edible and “lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours,” there’s a common recommendation by the marijuana industry to “start low, go slow.”
That sensible approach should also apply as Congress considers banking legislation.
The SAFE Banking Act will help marijuana industry investors make a lot more money. As any negotiator knows, it’s when one party wants something that it is most willing to compromise. In this case, Congress can demand key safeguards for children that the industry has so far resisted.
That should include an amendment that limits the SAFE Banking Act to products that fall below a specific THC potency level and that have complied with adequate testing, labeling, and consumer safety standards. As more research on THC’s impact on the brain becomes available, Congress could revisit the potency limit.
As we’ve learned with the vaping epidemic when the proliferation of radically new products gets ahead of the research and regulations, terrible health consequences result.
As Congress considers the SAFE Banking Act, let’s make sure children have a voice, too. After all, they only have one chance to grow up.
Diane Carlson is Co-Founder and National Policy Director of Smart Colorado, the only nonprofit organization focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of youth as marijuana becomes increasingly available and commercialized.

Joe Biden's early state woes

Texto completo: Joe Biden continues to have a clear lead in national polls for the Democratic nomination. But, as we enter the stage at which early state polling starts to matter, he's in real trouble.
Recent polls have put Biden in fourth place in Iowa and third place in New Hampshire. True, he's ahead in Nevada, which is the third contest, and in South Carolina, where his strong support among black voters has given him a commanding lead. A New York Times/Sienna poll also shows him with a lead in some later states — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. But as we've seen time and again, these primaries do not happen in a vacuum. If he falters in Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll likely see his numbers fall in Nevada and South Carolina, which in turn would hinder his performance in the states that come after that.
To be sure, there's enough of a traffic jam up top right now that it's perfectly conceivable that he can sweep Iowa and New Hampshire and be off to the races. But absent that, what he needs is a decent enough performance in the first two states to still be considered viable by the time the more favorable contests come along.
The next best result to winning the first two races would be an outcome in which Iowa and New Hampshire are won by two different candidates, and he ends up in second place both times. In that scenario, no other candidate would be able to claim clear front-runner status, and while Biden wouldn't have won a race outright, by coming in second, he will have beaten each of the winners one time.
Either way, short of victory, if he can at least ensure there's a jumble coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, then he may be able to build a bridge from the earlier primaries where he's fading to the later ones where he's in better shape.
Of course, his declines in Iowa and New Hampshire, which receive the most attention early in the race, could be a leading indicator of where other polls are going to go once voters elsewhere have had more time to focus on the candidates.

Texto completo: Eddie Murphy's Netflix movie, "Dolemite Is My Name," is not family entertainment. The language is relentlessly vulgar and the real-life 1970s entertainer Rudy Ray Moore portrayed by Mr. Murphy contributed to a coarsening of culture and the promotion of negative stereotypes. Yet in this story of a washed-up, broke singer who wills himself into the movie industry, we have the rare Hollywood product that captures the spirit of entrepreneurial creativity.
Especially in a political and media climate which too often presents market competition as a scheme dominated by cartoonish oligarchs, this is the story of the ambitious small business dreamers who make the economy go.
Calling Mr. Moore a "D.I.Y. comedy pioneer," Reggie Ugwu wrote in the New York Times in September:
Rudy Ray Moore was, if nothing else, self-made. Self-made in the conventional, entrepreneurial sense — born in Arkansas on the eve of the Great Depression, he would traverse the unforgiving worlds of stand-up comedy, blaxploitation film and early hip-hop before his death in 2008. But also self-made in that other, less venerated way, common among certain figures who become legendary in show business: He was a brazen author of his own mythology.
Mr. Moore certainly had to sell himself. No one else would. And aggressive self-promotion was just about all he had. Yet he managed to publish his own comedy records before producing his own film. Recently in the Times, Aisha Harris described Mr. Moore's remarkable ability to ignore all the sensible reasons not to attempt a cinematic career:
Rudy, undeterred by changing tastes or his own lack of filmmaking experience, decides to self-finance and self-produce his movie. And thus "Dolemite" is born, a low-budget production about a pimp/nightclub owner featuring the three key things Rudy wants to see in a movie: nudity, comedy and kung-fu...
Rudy doesn't exactly have the talent or expertise, but he pulls together a cast and crew through his sharp enterprising skills — their soundstage, a rundown former hotel that is now a drug den, is procured for free when Rudy strikes a deal with the owner to remove the addicts camped out in the building. His ability to make something out of nothing proves to be his greatest asset.
Mr. Moore begins sleeping in the former hotel to avoid the necessity of rent payments and uses his comedy recordings as collateral to borrow just enough money to complete the picture.
This compelling story of independent filmmaking will likely resonate with anyone who's ever worked at a start-up of any kind. Perhaps movie producers will now consider telling the stories of creative gumption occurring every day in other industries.

The Climate of Bloomberg
Speaking of socially liberal but relatively fiscally conservative self-made men, Michael Bloomberg may soon be presenting himself as the moderate in the Democratic presidential race. To have a hope of making the sale with voters, he'll need to express that moderation in his economic agenda.
His entry into the race could bring a needed counterweight in Democratic debates lately dominated by anti-market extremism. But it may be pointless if Mr. Bloomberg intends to offer yet another multi-trillion-dollar climate plan premised on a radical overhaul of U.S. industry. In June of this year, Mr. Bloomberg's eponymous news service published an adaptation of his address to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology class of 2019. It didn't sound all that moderate:
We know how to power buildings using the sun and wind; how to power vehicles using batteries charged with renewable energy; how to power factories and industry using hydrogen and fuel cells... Yes, all of those power sources need to be brought to scale — and that will require further scientific innovation. But the question isn't, "How do we tackle climate change?" The question is, "Why the hell are we moving so slowly?"
... Our goal is to move the U.S. toward a 100% clean energy economy as expeditiously as possible, beginning right now...We will push states and utilities to phase out every last U.S. coal-fired power plant by 2030... We will work to stop the construction of new gas plants.
***
Message from Foreign Investors: America First The Trump political style is even less popular overseas than it is in the United States. But the substance of U.S. prosperity in the Trump era has made the country more popular than ever by one very important measure. The Journal's Steven Russolillo reports:
Even with U.S. stocks rallying back to all-time highs, adding to the longest bull market on record, many foreign investors feel they have no choice but to pile in.
... U.S. stocks remain appealing, despite rich valuations, because of brighter domestic growth prospects than other developed economies, a strong labor market and solid consumer spending, global investors say... Foreign private holdings of U.S. stocks hit a record high of $7.7 trillion as of July, the most recent data available, according to Treasury Department figures. The data for foreign funds excludes holdings from sovereign-wealth funds and central banks, meaning overall international holdings are likely substantially higher.

Texto completo: Mary Anne Fidati Eggleston, 76, of Waverly, enjoyed great success in her life as a gifted entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and was a respected businesswoman in Northeast Pennsylvania for decades.
She worked tirelessly as a director/vice president at Pagnotti Enterprises and its subsidiary companies where she played an integral role in re-energizing and revitalizing the businesses that her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., founded in 1934. In addition, her entrepreneurial footprint lives on today in the water filtration industry at both Carbon Sales Inc. and the Unifilt Corp., where she was both a founder and corporate officer.
Born in Scranton on July 29, 1943, she was the daughter of the late F. Robert and Marie Pagnotti Fidati.
Mary Anne graduated from Marywood Seminary and attended Wheeling College, Wheeling, W.Va.
Mary Anne passed away Oct. 5 at Allied Skilled Nursing following a courageous battle with cancer.
Mary Anne was involved in a number of local organizations, sat on numerous boards and participated in philanthropic efforts throughout her life. A true pioneer, she was one of the first women to be admitted to the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre, and was a founding board member at the Luzerne Foundation. Mary Anne was a board member at King’s College, where she was instrumental in the formation of the King’s College Family Business Forum and also sat on the board at Friendship House. She was an original Everhart Museum board member when the community board was formed, played a significant part in the restoration of the mineral exhibit at the museum and was recognized as the honoree in 2015 at the Everhart Museum Summer Solstice event.
Mary Anne is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Bubba and Tracy Eggleston, and her two grandchildren, Elle and Brett, around whom her world revolved. She is also survived by her sister, Judy Fidati Haudenschield, and Jeff Haudenschield and their two sons, David and Christopher. Judy truly considered Mary Anne to be both a sister and mother to her, as David and Christopher fondly thought of her more as their grandmother than as their aunt. They were her closest relatives living locally and were a primary reason she fought so hard to survive.
Even during her time at Allied, she still always looked forward to being a part of as many milestones as possible in the lives of her family and her businesses. She cherished her friends from near and far, and always loved sharing stories about the fun times she had enjoyed throughout her life with her cousins.
Strongly influenced by her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., and his larger than life personality, she was a dynamic woman who was determined in business, yet even incredibly more caring and sensitive in her family life. She had a realistic way of looking at the world and her intuitive ability to quickly judge people’s characters was truly amazing and always spot-on. Some of her greatest pleasures were her time with family, gourmet cooking, reading the Sunday edition of The New York Times and watching college and professional football. She was an avid Penn State fan.
We appreciate the superior efforts of the staff at Allied Services and of her caregivers, Kathy, Keith and Melissa, who offered personal attention, compassion and love to Mary Anne over the last few years.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary Anne’s honor to Project Koru at https://secure.givelively
.org/donate/project-koru/mary-anne-eggleston
-memorial, the Everhart Museum, The Fund for Luzerne County at The Luzerne Foundation, or a charity of your choice.
Please join us in a celebration of Mary Anne’s life to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Glenmaura National Golf Club, 100 Glenmaura National Blvd., Moosic.
Arrangements have been entrusted to Lawrence E. Young Funeral Home and Cremation Services Inc.

Texto completo: The freedom to read and access information and ideas from diverse viewpoints are essential to creating a society of informed citizens. Public libraries play a vital role in this effort to ensure that all people have access to a wide range of information, perspectives and ideas in a variety of formats so they can make informed decisions that impact their lives.
On behalf of the Florida Library Association, representing more than 1,050 members and 60 public and academic institutions, we oppose the recent position taken by the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners in its denial of the library's electronic subscription to the New York Times. We firmly believe that all residents and library visitors should be allowed access to varying viewpoints as promised by their First Amendment rights.
The American Library Association (of which the Florida Library Association is a chapter) maintains the Library Bill of Rights and ALA Code of Ethics to guide libraries in collecting and providing access to a diverse set of materials that do not discriminate on the basis of background or beliefs.
Specifically, the Library Bill of Rights states, "Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all viewpoints on current and historical issues."
Further, libraries and librarians ensure the criteria used to select materials do not discriminate on the basis of factors such as political or religious viewpoint or the background, identity, gender, or beliefs of the publisher or author.
Decisions about which materials are added to a library collection should never be made on the basis of personal or political viewpoints. Selections should be made based on the availability of funds, the needs and interests of library patrons, and in consideration of the library's mission to provide balanced coverage of important topics so that members of the community can educate themselves, draw their own conclusions and participate fully in society.
By restricting access to a specific resource based on personal political beliefs, Citrus County commissioners are denying their constituents the ability to seek and receive information from a wide range of viewpoints and formats. They are overriding the recommendation of library professionals, not due to budgetary or public safety concerns but because the viewpoint of that publication does not match their own.
We expect our civic leaders to review information from all sides of an issue before making a decision that will represent the best interests of the community. We would not want them to make decisions based on incomplete information. We want the same for all members of the public.
As articulated in a recent statement by the American Library Association:
"Public libraries are government agencies subject to the First Amendment. Rejecting or censoring a publication based upon its political viewpoint represents both content and viewpoint discrimination that is contrary to the spirit of the First Amendment's promise of freedom of speech and freedom of belief."
In order to uphold Americans' First Amendment rights, governments at any level should not withhold funding or reject proposals to provide library patrons access to any information on the basis of political or personal viewpoints.
The members of the Florida Library Association urge the members of the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners to reconsider the recommendation of library staff and allow the members of the public to decide for themselves which news sources they choose to follow.
Heather Snapp is the first year experience and outreach librarian at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, and serves as the chair of the Florida Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee.

National, state polls on Trump don't match

Texto completo: "Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive. Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his reelection bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% – or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance – such as the economy – and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election – on a knife's edge.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive. Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations.
The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Mr. Steyer's Iowa campaign, aren't illegal - though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There's no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Mr. Steyer's campaign as compensation for their backing.
But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Mr. Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Mr. Steyer's campaign would think he could purchase their support.
Pence dismisses claim
WASHINGTON - Senior White House officials were certain Vice President Mike Pence would back an effort to have President Donald Trump removed from office over concerns about his mental state, the "Anonymous" administration official plans to claim in their forthcoming book, a source close to the book process confirms to CNN's Jake Tapper.
The book doesn't say Mr. Pence actually said he would support such a move, according to a summary of an excerpt first reported by HuffPost, which the source described as accurate.
The vice president dismissed the report Thursday and called on the book's author - who has been described as a senior Trump administration official who previously alleged there's an internal administration resistance to Trump in a 2018 New York Times op-ed - to resign.
Trump denies Barr report
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday denied a report that he wanted Attorney General William Barr to hold a press conference to declare he broke no laws during a July phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democrats.
Mr. Trump tweeted just after midnight that the story, first reported by The Washington Post, "is totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don't exist."
The Post reported that Mr. Barr rebuffed the request, which came in September around the time the White House released a rough transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call at the center of the House impeachment probe. House Democrats are investigating Mr. Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals as aid money was being withheld from the Eastern European country.
Sessions to run for Senate
WASHINGTON - Jeff Sessions said he'll run for the Alabama Senate seat that he vacated in 2017 to became President Donald Trump's first U.S. attorney general..
Mr. Sessions, 72, a former top Republican on the Senate Judiciary and Budget panels, easily held onto his seat for two decades, and his entry shakes up the race to defeat Democratic incumbent Doug Jones.
Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, won a surprise December 2017 special election over Republican Roy Moore, a former Alabama chief justice who became mired in allegations of sexual assault and misconduct that he denied.

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is taking steps to enter the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, one of his advisers said, months after the former New York City mayor said he wouldn't run.
Mr. Bloomberg is preparing a possible bid out of concern that the current candidates might not be able to defeat President Trump, his adviser Howard Wolfson said.
"Mike believes that Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to our nation," Mr. Wolfson said.
"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Mr. Wolfson said.
Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Bloomberg was making preparations to appear on Alabama's primary ballot. The filing deadline is Friday, and Alabama is one of 14 states holding contests on March 3, known as "Super Tuesday."
People familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's plans said he hasn't made a final decision about whether to run. His entry would add a new dimension to an already crowded field and offer a well-financed alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden for voters seeking a more centrist candidate to challenge the president.
Two leading progressive candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, cheered the potential of another billionaire joining Tom Steyer in the 16-person race. Ms. Warren, who has made her wealth tax a signature part of her agenda, welcomed Mr. Bloomberg and referred him to her campaign's "calculator for the billionaires."
Mr. Sanders tweeted, "The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."
Mr. Bloomberg, 77 years old, would add to the septuagenarians in the field, joining Messrs. Sanders, Biden and Ms. Warren, against Mr. Trump, 73.
Mr. Bloomberg's move toward running comes as some in the party -- especially wealthy donors -- grumble about the leftward lurch of the party, with Ms. Warren on the rise and Mr. Biden faltering in early states.
Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran of presidential politics, said Mr. Bloomberg's potential entry could serve as a "big disruption" in the race. "There's plenty of obstacles, but the fact is, he's got the resources to compete," Mr. Trippi said. He said Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers were unlikely to be "entertaining this unless they saw a path."
But he would enter the field with fewer than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses and months after most top candidates have plowed millions of dollars into organizing in early states. The filing deadline for New Hampshire, the second nominating contest, is next week.
Most Democrats are satisfied with their choices for presidential nominee, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found late last month. Some 85% of the party's primary voters said they were satisfied with the candidates, including 31% who said they were "very satisfied." By contrast, 13% said they were unsatisfied.
Mr. Bloomberg's public image nationally remains something of a blank slate, Journal/NBC News polling has found. In a 2016 survey, the most recent one testing Mr. Bloomberg, about one-third of voters said they had a neutral view of him, and about one-quarter said they were unsure of their impression or didn't know his name. Some 16% of voters in the poll said they had a positive impression of Mr. Bloomberg, and 27% said they had a negative one.
The New York Times reported on Mr. Bloomberg's plans Thursday.
Mr. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, flirted with the idea of running late last year.
He had invested tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections and made several stops in December 2018 in Iowa, where the nomination season begins with the Feb. 3 caucuses.
Mr. Bloomberg had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the Republican Party ahead of his run for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP and became unaffiliated with any party when he contemplated running for president in 2008. He re-registered as a Democrat last year.
A person familiar with his plans said he didn't fully close the door to a 2020 campaign when he made public his decision not to run earlier this year. Mr. Bloomberg's team had an internal deadline of about a year before Election Day, which will be Nov. 3, 2020, to decide, the person said. Members of his team recently spoke to Democratic strategists, another person familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Bloomberg spoke Thursday to former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, a longtime power broker in the early-voting state, and discussed the possibility of running, a spokesman for Mr. Reid confirmed. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an email that Mr. Bloomberg left him a phone message on Thursday.
Michael John Gray, chairman of the Democratic Party in Arkansas -- another state with a coming filing deadline -- said his office received a call from a Washington, D.C., firm inquiring about the filing process. The representatives from the firm declined to name the candidate, "but the word 'mystery' was used," a spokesman for the party said.

Progressives, Centrists and Europhobia

Texto completo: Who's out of touch with reality, again?
Will the Democratic presidential nomination go to a centrist or a progressive? Which choice would give the party the best chance in next year's election? Honestly, I have no idea.
One thing I can say, however, is that neither centrism nor progressivism is what it used to be.
There was a time when arguments between centrists and progressives were framed as debates between realism and idealism. These days, however, it often seems as if the centrists, not the progressives, are out of touch with reality. Indeed, sometimes it feels as if centrists are Rip Van Winkles who spent the last 20 years in a cave and missed everything that has happened to America and the world since the 1990s.
You can see this in politics, where Joe Biden has repeatedly declared that Republicans will have an "epiphany" once Donald Trump is gone, and once again become reasonable people Democrats can deal with. Given the G.O.P.'s scorched-earth politics during the Obama years, that's a bizarre claim.
You can also see it in economics. There are many reasonable criticisms you could offer of Elizabeth Warren's economic proposals. But the one I keep seeing is that Warren would turn America into (cue scary music) Europe, maybe even (cue even scarier music) France. And you have to wonder whether people who say such things have paid any attention to either Europe or America over the past few decades.
Just to be clear, Europe does have big economic problems. But they're not the ones such people seem to imagine.
When people say such things, they seem to have in mind a picture of the U.S.-Europe comparison that did seem to have some validity in the 1990s. In that picture, nations with large social spending and extensive government regulation of markets suffered from "Eurosclerosis," persistent lack of jobs.
Employers, the story went, were reluctant to expand both because of high taxes and because they feared not being able to fire workers once hired. At the same time, workers had little incentive to accept jobs because they could live off generous social programs.
Europe also seemed to be lagging in the adoption of new technology: For a while, the U.S. surged ahead in making use of the internet and information technology in general, leading to arguments that Europe's high taxes and regulation were discouraging innovation.
But all of that was a long time ago. The jobs gap has largely vanished; adults in their prime working years are actually more likely to be employed in Europe, France included, than they are in America.
Any gap in the adoption of information technology has also long since vanished; households in much of Europe are as or more likely to have broadband than their U.S. counterparts, partly because the U.S. failure to limit providers' monopoly power has led to much higher prices for internet access.
It's true that European nations have lower G.D.P. per capita than we do, but that's largely because, unlike most Americans, most Europeans actually have significant vacation time and hence work fewer hours per year. This sounds like a choice about work-life balance, not an economic problem.
And on that most fundamental of indicators, life expectancy, the U.S. has fallen far behind: French residents can expect, on average, to live more than four years longer than Americans. Why? Universal health care and policies that mitigate extreme inequality are the most likely explanations.
Now, I don't want this to sound like praise of all things European. The nations on the euro remain terribly vulnerable to financial crises, because they've adopted a shared currency without a shared banking safety net; only the heroic leadership of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, avoided a catastrophic collapse of the euro in 2012.
Europe also suffers from persistent weakness in demand because key players, Germany in particular, have an obsessive fear of deficits, even when the European economy desperately needs stimulus.
These are big problems, severe enough that I wouldn't be surprised if Europe is the epicenter of the next global crisis. But the problem with Europe is not that its social programs are too generous and its governments too intrusive. If anything, it's almost the opposite: Europe's economy is vulnerable because a combination of political fragmentation and ideological rigidity has left its politicians unwilling to be Keynesian enough.
The point is that centrists who point to Europe as an illustration of the bad things that happen when you're too enthusiastic about pursuing social justice are stuck decades in the past. Modern European experience actually vindicates progressive claims that we can do a lot to make America fairer without destroying incentives. And even Europe's problems make the case for more government intervention, not less.
By all means, let's talk about whether "Medicare for all," wealth taxes and other progressive proposals are actually good ideas. But trying to shoot them down by going on about how terrible things are in France is a sure sign that you have no idea what you're talking about.

Mr. Bloomberg is preparing a possible bid out of concern that the current candidates may not be able to defeat President Trump, his adviser Howard Wolfson said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you think Michael Bloomberg could bring to the 2020 presidential race? What would you want to ask him? Join the conversation below.
"Mike believes that Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to our nation," Mr. Wolfson said.
"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated—but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Mr. Wolfson said.
Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Bloomberg was making preparations to appear on Alabama's primary ballot. The filing deadline is Friday, and Alabama is one of 14 states holding contests on March 3, known as "Super Tuesday."

Mr. Sanders tweeted, "The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."
Mr. Bloomberg, 77 years old, would add to the septuagenarians in the field, joining Messrs. Sanders, Biden and Ms. Warren, against President Trump, 73.
Mr. Bloomberg's move toward running comes as some in the party—especially wealthy donors—grumble about the leftward lurch of the party, with Ms. Warren on the rise and Mr. Biden faltering in early states.
Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran of presidential politics, said Mr. Bloomberg's potential entry could serve as a "big disruption" in the race. "There's plenty of obstacles, but the fact is, he's got the resources to compete," Mr. Trippi said. He said Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers were unlikely to be "entertaining this unless they saw a path."
But he would enter the field with fewer than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses and months after most top candidates have plowed millions of dollars into organizing in early states. The filing deadline for New Hampshire, the second nominating contest, is Friday Nov. 15.
Democrats are satisfied with their choices for presidential nominee, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found late last month. Some 85% of the party's primary voters said they were satisfied with the candidates, including 31% who said they were "very satisfied.'' By contrast, 13% said they were unsatisfied.
Mr. Bloomberg's public image nationally remains something of a blank slate, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling has found. In a 2016 survey, the most recent one testing Mr. Bloomberg, about one-third of voters said they had a neutral view of him, and about one-quarter said they were unsure of their impression or didn't know his name.
Some 16% of voters in the poll said they had a positive impression of Mr. Bloomberg, and 27% said they had a negative one.
The New York Times reported on Mr. Bloomberg's plans Thursday.
Mr. Bloomberg's possible entry comes as a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found the majority of those surveyed—74%—were satisfied with the current field; 16% said they wanted another candidate.
Mr. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, flirted with the idea of running late last year.
He had invested tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections and made several stops in December 2018 in Iowa, where the nomination season begins with the Feb. 3 caucuses.
Mr. Bloomberg had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the Republican Party ahead of his run for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP and became unaffiliated with any party when he flirted with running for president in 2008. He re-registered as a Democrat last year.
Mr. Bloomberg announced in March he wouldn't run for president because of the difficulty in winning the Democratic Party's nomination.
"I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election," Mr. Bloomberg wrote . "But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field."
He didn't fully close the door to running, however, a person familiar with his plans said. Mr. Bloomberg's team had an internal deadline of about a year before Election Day, which will be Nov. 3, 2020, to decide, the person added. Members of his team recently spoke to Democratic strategists, another person familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Bloomberg spoke Thursday to former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, a longtime power broker in the early voting state, and discussed the possibility of running, a spokesman for Mr. Reid confirmed.
Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an email that Mr. Bloomberg left him a phone message on Thursday.

* Who's Running in the 2020 Race
Michael John Gray, chairman of the Democratic Party in Arkansas—another state with a coming filing deadline—said his office received a call from a Washington, D.C., firm around Thursday noon inquiring about the filing process. The representatives from the firm declined to name the candidate, "but the word 'mystery' was used," a spokesman for the party said.
In August at a gun-control event that he helped finance in Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg criticized Ms. Warren for her aggressive tone toward corporations and Wall Street.
"I just said to Sen. Warren on the way out, 'Senator, congratulations, it was a nice talk, but just let me remind you if my company hadn't been successful, we wouldn't be here today,' so enough with this stuff," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg has been a frequent critic of President Trump. "Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business? God help us," Mr. Bloomberg said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where he endorsed Hillary Clinton. "I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one."
A person familiar with Bloomberg LP said no decisions have yet been made as to whether the company will be put into a blind trust should Mr. Bloomberg win the presidency.
A spokeswoman for Bloomberg News had no immediate comment on how Bloomberg's reporters will cover Mr. Bloomberg if he chooses to run. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg News did cover news reports that Mr. Bloomberg is again contemplating a race for president in 2020.

Texto completo: Kanye West’s improbable and dramatic turn to traditional Christianity has stunned many of us. It also appears to have cultural legs. His new “Jesus Is King” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart this week. All 11 songs are among the top 100 in the nation, an astonishing feat for an album that is also ranked on the Christian and gospel charts.
The popular reaction has ranged from deeply skeptical, to genuinely confused, to overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Indeed, Google already has seen a massive rise in “faith-based searches” after the release of “Jesus Is King.” Some are even openly discussing the possibility of it sparking a new “Christian revival.”
Kanye has used this intense public interest, however, to elaborate on some of the themes of his conversion and of the music it has produced.
Like all of us, Kanye is on his own search for truth and meaning. But we have an opportunity to learn from a man who has experienced the searing highs and lows that life has to offer — from international fame and fortune to the death of his beloved mother.
Here are five things we have learned in recent days about what Kayne knows.
Jesus Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords
In the final track — titled “Jesus Is Lord” — Kanye simply writes and sings the following:
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord
In an age of equivocation, relativism and general desire not to offend others, Kanye is saying what he knows to be objectively true. His monotheistic claims are not the mealy-mouthed banalities of someone doing the equivalent of sharing a favorite lentil soup recipe. They are the powerful proclamations of someone who has been seized by the truth.
Not “a” truth or “my” truth. The Truth.
Accepting the lordship of Jesus has implications. Kanye recently preached a sermon in Atlanta calling for “radical obedience” to Christ. In one of many references to sacred Scripture, his new music exhorts “everything that hath breath praise the Lord.”
About the time Kanye’s conversion was lighting up social media, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat published a piece arguing that the demise of traditional Christianity in the U.S. has been greatly exaggerated. He cited a recent Pew Research Center survey that showed that the losses in Christian affiliation in the U.S. have come from “lukewarm” believers, not core adherents. Kanye’s new music is aimed at the latter.
“Freedom” as promised to us by the world is an addiction or slavery
Nobody has known our consumerist culture’s version of success better than Kanye. It nearly destroyed him, as it has destroyed so many others.
In an interview with James Corden, Kanye noted that God is using his story of triumph over this pain and suffering so those in a similar situation could better relate to his story. He knows from personal experience just how hard it is to reach people caught in our cultural trap: “People who don’t believe are walking dead. They are asleep and this is the awakening.”
He sings, “No more livin’ for the culture, we nobody’s slave.” While admitting that “the devil had my soul, I can’t lie,” he insists that “there is freedom from addiction.”
One addiction he’s discussed is his obsession with pornography. He’s not alone. Russell Brand, Chris Rock and Cameron Diaz are just a few public figures who have been open about how porn has devastated their lives.
In a clear call for resistance to a culture that has harmed so many, Kanye asked those collaborating with him on “Jesus Is King” to refrain from sex outside of marriage. He has witnessed to the fact that a culture that promotes extramarital sex brings slavery, not authentic liberation.
There are deep problems with our disconnected secular (sub)urban lifestyles
Kanye’s music career has had a global impact that has taken him to all corners of the earth. But his recent focus on rebuilding communities from the ground up — instead of top down — couldn’t be more timely.
In an interview with the radio personality and record producer Zane Lowe, Kanye went full Christian localism, a movement that works to counteract globalism by working to better our communities. He noted that our consumerist culture is seemingly designed to make others a great deal of money.
As an alternative, he proposes a living arrangement in which the things that really matter are intentionally put at the ideological — and sometimes literal — center of our lives. The “best form” of “gathering together” is family, says Kanye. We need to “keep our families close.”
The best way to do this? “To think of communities of where the church is at the center of the community, the school, the cafeteria, sustainable gardens and then the homes,” he told Lowe.
Abortion has taken a heavy toll on African American communities
In 2013, Kanye released a song titled “Blood on the Leaves” that some observers took to be clearly in support of abortion, while others thought the opposite.
Kanye has now left that ambiguity behind. In an interview about “Jesus Is King,” he railed against those who are “making us abort our children” as a key part of what African American communities have often had to endure as a social expectation from those in power.
He is in good company. African American leaders like Alveda King (niece of Martin Luther King Jr.), Ryan Bomberger (director of the pro-life Radiance Foundation), Jason Riley (columnist for The Wall Street Journal) and Christina Bennett (National Black Pro-Life Coalition) have used similar language to describe how abortion has hurt African Americans.
Kanye also makes clear, in a time when some people argue that climate change is a reason not to have children, that children are to be welcomed as a gift from God.
When asked by Corden about having more kids, his eyes lit up with excitement in saying that he wanted more than the four he already had. How many more? “Seven,” said Kanye. “The richest thing you can do is have as many children as possible.”
Conversion is only the beginning of our journey, which will be difficult
Kanye, like the rest of us, is not perfect. He is growing into his relationship with Christ and the church and, like the rest of us, he still has a way to go before being perfected by Christ’s redeeming grace. For instance, he recently seemed to say that God had something to do with giving him a large tax refund. Let us hope that Kanye dives into Scripture and tradition in ways that impress upon him the problems with dangerous idols like the prosperity gospel.
If someone like Kanye truly lives the kind of Christian life “Jesus Is King” indicates, it could be a cultural game changer.
It won’t be easy. Those who benefit from our culture’s status quo are already starting to resist this move. Indeed, as actress Patricia Heaton (herself a very public Christian) recently observed, they are “really going to scrutinize everything he does to catch him falling down.”
Let us join Heaton in praying for Kanye. Both for his own good and for the good of a culture that desperately needs to know what he knows.

Farhad Manjoo: Instead of a generational culture war, let’s fight the rich

Texto completo: Generations are pretty bogus. The labels we use to casually slice up society — boomer, millennial, Gen X, Gen Z — are a nearly useless way of thinking about politics, culture or business in the U.S. The very idea that tens of millions of people across different classes and races and geographies might hold similar views on a range of subjects just because they happened to be born during the same 20-year span of U.S. history — the whole thing sounds a bit too much like astrology, doesn’t it?
In fact, demographers, whose profession came up with these labels, constantly stress the limitations and complications of generational analysis. Generations can be useful for observing broad-scale changes in attitudes over long periods of time, but they break down into clichés and stereotypes when they are used to make specific observations about the world.
Marketers and much of the media tend to be quite careless in how we wield generational labels. We invest these categories with too much meaning, often ascribing to generational ideology what is more likely a product of age, wealth and a variety of other factors. Consider, for instance, the absurd parade of stories about how millennials are “killing” various industries, from golf to wedding rings. They collectively paint young people as being somehow philosophically deficient as consumers rather than simply not very wealthy.
Of course, I would dismiss generations: I’m a Gen Xer, and our whole thing is rejecting labels.
On the other hand, I might be a boomer, because lately I’ve been nursing a crazy conspiracy theory about generational analysis: I think it’s a plot by The Man to keep us from changing the world. Focusing on generational differences distracts the masses from going after more salient differences in society — especially the power held by the wealthy, whatever their age.
All of this explains why I’m not really OK with “ok boomer,” the latest rallying cry in the permanent war between the Young and the Old. As Taylor Lorenz reported in The New York Times last week, “ok boomer” is a meme started by teenagers to shred older people who express a broad range of antiquated ideas about the world. (The grammar snoot in me — and my copy editor — would prefer the meme rendered as “O.K., boomer,” with periods and a comma, but of course that’s not how teenagers write.)
At first glance, the phrase — which, since Lorenz’s report, has been co-opted and repeated into cringing ubiquity by just about every other generation — is the perfect response to your racist grandpa on Facebook and your liberal uncle on Wall Street who is very worried about Medicare for All. It’s knowing, cutting, dismissive and almost impossible to gracefully recover from “ok boomer” and you’re done.
At the risk of sounding like a patronizing Old, I’ll concede that “ok boomer” means well, and I don’t begrudge teenagers their anger. They are certainly right that over several generations and across political ideologies, the holders of political and economic power in the U.S. totally screwed things up for the future. Boomer leaders (and their forebears) underinvested in long-term infrastructure and safety nets and economic and environmental rules. They overindulged in wars and tax cuts and systemic deregulation. They long overlooked racial and gender bias, sexual harassment and just about every other form of systemic discrimination. They brought the country and the world to the sorry place we’re in now.
Yet it’s a mistake to blame all boomers for the sins of the most powerful among them. As a taunt, “ok boomer” overlooks the vast differences within the postwar generation; there are rich boomers and poor boomers, far-left boomers and far-right ones, boomers who are fighting for right and those who are hopelessly stuck in yesteryear. And “ok boomer” lets other generations off the hook, neglecting the facts that millennials keep gaining greater economic and political power and that some of them are starting to act and sound like archetypal boomers.
Teenagers themselves seem to recognize this: “boomer is state of mind,” Lorenz writes of how the young think of the term. On the phone, she pointed to further evidence of the flexibility of “boomer” as a taunt. On Twitter, she notes, Pete Buttigieg, the youngest of the 2020 Democratic candidates, is frequently dismissed as radiating big boomer energy. Even though he’s a millennial, there’s something about his rhetorical style that feels antiquated. And Buttigieg’s boomerishness only underlines the hollowness of the whole idea of generational stereotyping. It suggests a more profitable political path for young people: Instead of canceling an entire generation, why not set your sights on a smaller, more specific group, one that bears more direct complicity in America’s widening dystopia?
Not to go full Chapo Trap House on you, but yes, I’m talking about the wealthy. Instead of “ok boomer,” how about “ok billionaire”?
I’ve been preoccupied with billionaires for much of the year. In February, I argued that we should “abolish” billionaires and wannabe billionaires because they exert outsize control over America’s resources. Insofar as they highlight the unforgivable ways that wealthy people have rigged the political system, billionaires are both a convenient and an appropriate political target of the moment.
On just about any important issue of the day, from climate change to mass incarceration to defeating President Donald Trump, meaningful political change will come about only through cross-generational coordination. It will require concerned people of all ages to band together to alter the status quo. One reason this is difficult in the U.S. is, we’ve been conditioned to think that people who are much older or younger than we are might be completely alien beings: Every millennial is an avocado-eating virtue signaler who won’t listen to opposing views; all boomers are white, affluent, selfish racists who can’t recognize their privilege; and the two sides will never see eye to eye on anything.
But that is plainly false. Last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who’s 30, endorsed 78-year-old Bernie Sanders for president — not despite his age, but because Sanders’ “decades of work” on progressive causes was a sign of his fidelity to the movement. In the summer, Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who has scolded older people for ignoring the issue. Among other things, the pair discussed how age was simply a mindset. “You can be much older and still part of a youth movement if you refuse to do things just because that’s the way they’ve always been done,” Ocasio-Cortez told Thunberg.
This is the sort of coalition we need to build a better future — not Gen Z fighting boomers, but a coalition of 16-year-olds and 30-year-olds and 78-year-olds joining together to demolish the rich who run the world today. The stakes are too great; we can’t afford to have any generation sit this one out.

Bret Stephens: Mexico is on a path to becoming a failed state

Texto completo: Mexico City • On a working visit here, I have dinner with one of the country’s elder statesmen and listen to him describe its greatest challenges. He names three: “Rule of law. Rule of law. And rule of law.”
The truth of the observation is underscored a few days later, when gunmen kill nine members of the LeBarón family along a back-country road in the northern state of Sonora. The motive for the massacre is unclear, but its barbarity is not: three women and six children, including infant twins, shot at close range and burned alive in their cars.
The episode has gained major attention in the U.S. largely because the LeBaróns are part of a long-standing American Mormon presence in northern Mexico. (George Romney, the late Michigan governor and Mitt’s father, was born in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua in 1907, which he was forced to flee as a child during the Mexican Revolution.)
But the reason the killings really matter is that they are yet another reminder that Mexico is on a fast track toward becoming a failed state.
For this, blame a combination of managerial incompetence and ideological inanity from Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In 2015, I asked then-candidate Trump whether he feared that his protectionist policies would hurt Mexico in ways that ultimately would hurt the United States as well. His reply: “I don’t care about Mexico, honestly. I really don’t care about Mexico.”
Since then, Trump has forced a dubious renegotiation of NAFTA but has yet to get the new trade agreement ratified in Congress, causing business uncertainties that have brought the Mexican economy to the edge of recession. It took the administration more than a year to replace its ambassador in Mexico, after the last one resigned in disgust. And Trump’s insistence that Mexico militarize its southern border with Guatemala has drained its army of the manpower it needs to fight the drug cartels.
Last month, in the northwestern city of Culiacán, Mexican security forces found themselves quickly outnumbered and outgunned when they tried to arrest the son of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the jailed drug lord. The soldiers capitulated and the son was promptly freed.
If Trump’s actions have been damaging, López Obrador’s have been disastrous.
His slogan in the face of cartel violence is “hugs, not bullets.” His strategy has been to increase spending on social programs while urging gangsters to think of their mothers. He has claimed, preposterously, that crime is under control and still insists he has no intention of rethinking his approach. In the Culiacán fiasco, he praised the decision to release El Chapo’s son while ordering the disclosure of the officer’s name who had ordered the operation, endangering the man’s life. Much of the army officer corps now openly reviles their commander in chief.
A parody of a policy has produced a predictable result: 2019 is on course to become Mexico’s most violent year in decades, with about 17,000 killings between January and June. In sheer numbers, that’s a figure that exceeds the civilian death toll in Iraq at the height of war in 2006.
So what could work? A conversation with a former senior U.S. intelligence official suggests a bracing analogy.
“What has always been required,” the former official says, “is to construct a comprehensive, integrated civil-military campaign, where ‘military’ includes all security services , similar to a counterinsurgency campaign such as the one pursued in the surge in Iraq.”
But hasn’t that been tried before?
Not quite. Under President Felipe Calderón (2006-2012), Mexico pursued a “kingpin” strategy of taking down cartel leaders. But decapitation strikes never work when your enemy is a Hydra. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, believed that economic prosperity and political reform would be an antidote to criminality. But that turned out to be another mirage as growth lagged and corruption surged.
“When Mexican presidents have looked at this, it’s such a daunting task,” the former official notes. “It’s very manpower intensive, and it’s not just security forces to clear, hold, and build. They have to be supported by strong judicial authorities, which in turn have to be supported by strong prison authorities. Those are the three legs of the rule-of-law stool, and if any of them are weak, it can cause the whole enterprise to topple.”
In Mexico, all the legs of the stool are cracked. Prisons are out of control. Municipal authorities cower before the cartels. The “impunity rate” — that is, the likelihood that crimes will not be punished — is just shy of 99%.
This is not business as usual for Mexico. Either the country is going to get a grip on its crisis of institutions and its deficits in leadership or it is going to increasingly resemble Iraq before the surge, albeit with drug money taking the place of religious fanaticism. Donald Trump might not care about Mexico, but you should. Even if we build a wall, no crisis will ever respect a border.

Texto completo: Mary Anne Fidati Eggleston, 76, of Waverly, enjoyed great success in her life as a gifted entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and was a respected businesswoman in Northeast Pennsylvania for decades.
She worked tirelessly as a director/vice president at Pagnotti Enterprises and its subsidiary companies where she played an integral role in re-energizing and revitalizing the businesses that her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., founded in 1934. In addition, her entrepreneurial footprint lives on today in the water filtration industry at both Carbon Sales Inc. and the Unifilt Corp., where she was both a founder and corporate officer.
Born in Scranton on July 29, 1943, she was the daughter of the late F. Robert and Marie Pagnotti Fidati.
Mary Anne graduated from Marywood Seminary and attended Wheeling College, Wheeling, W.Va.
Mary Anne passed away Oct. 5 at Allied Skilled Nursing following a courageous battle with cancer.
Mary Anne was involved in a number of local organizations, sat on numerous boards and participated in philanthropic efforts throughout her life. A true pioneer, she was one of the first women to be admitted to the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre, and was a founding board member at the Luzerne Foundation. Mary Anne was a board member at King’s College, where she was instrumental in the formation of the King’s College Family Business Forum and also sat on the board at Friendship House. She was an original Everhart Museum board member when the community board was formed, played a significant part in the restoration of the mineral exhibit at the museum and was recognized as the honoree in 2015 at the Everhart Museum Summer Solstice event.
Mary Anne is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Bubba and Tracy Eggleston, and her two grandchildren, Elle and Brett, around whom her world revolved. She is also survived by her sister, Judy Fidati Haudenschield, and Jeff Haudenschield and their two sons, David and Christopher. Judy truly considered Mary Anne to be both a sister and mother to her, as David and Christopher fondly thought of her more as their grandmother than as their aunt. They were her closest relatives living locally and were a primary reason she fought so hard to survive.
Even during her time at Allied, she still always looked forward to being a part of as many milestones as possible in the lives of her family and her businesses. She cherished her friends from near and far, and always loved sharing stories about the fun times she had enjoyed throughout her life with her cousins.
Strongly influenced by her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., and his larger than life personality, she was a dynamic woman who was determined in business, yet even incredibly more caring and sensitive in her family life. She had a realistic way of looking at the world and her intuitive ability to quickly judge people’s characters was truly amazing and always spot-on. Some of her greatest pleasures were her time with family, gourmet cooking, reading the Sunday edition of The New York Times and watching college and professional football. She was an avid Penn State fan.
We appreciate the superior efforts of the staff at Allied Services and of her caregivers, Kathy, Keith and Melissa, who offered personal attention, compassion and love to Mary Anne over the last few years.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary Anne’s honor to Project Koru at https://secure.givelively.org/donate/project-koru/mary-anne-eggleston-memorial, the Everhart Museum, The Fund for Luzerne County at The Luzerne Foundation, or a charity of your choice.
Please join us in a celebration of Mary Anne’s life to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Glenmaura National Golf Club, 100 Glenmaura National Blvd., Moosic.
Arrangements have been entrusted to Lawrence E. Young Funeral Home and Cremation Services Inc.

Texto completo: MILWAUKEE — With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump’s worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn’t add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don’t always capture what’s happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn’t deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump’s average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
“I think the battleground polls are more meaningful” than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
“There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we’re seeing in the national polling. I don’t know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he’s only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can’t be true,” said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
“In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average,” said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette’s polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
“Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they’re close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states,” Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump’s approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state’s most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump‘s ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president’s approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump’s true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn’t changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump’s job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president’s approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent’s share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
“Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number,” ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will “overperform” his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
“It’s going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are,” said Goeas, who doesn’t think Trump’s approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
“His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him,” he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests “the president’s job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats. ”
The Marquette pollster said, “it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close,” with Trump still facing an “uphill” battle due to his negative ratings.
“Everyone’s obsession with Wisconsin isn’t just hype. It’s truly competitive,” Goldstein said. “Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it’s going to be a choice. ”
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said “We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be,” meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife’s edge.

Florida officials call New York Times 'fake'

Texto completo: Regular readers may know I usually avoid writing about Donald Trump.
That's for two simple reasons:
1) I care more about state and local issues, where I think I can make a difference, and,
2) Nobody cares what I think about Donald Trump.
Still, Trumpian politics sometimes bleed into Florida politics, making it harder to ignore.
That's the case in Citrus County, where commissioners recently blocked the library's plans to buy a digital subscription to The New York Times, calling it "fake news."
The library carries printed copies of the Times and a few other papers. But the library's director and advisory board wanted to also provide shared digital access to the most Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper in America - as many libraries already do. (I'll show you how to access Orange County's free newspaper-subscription service in a moment.)
But Citrus County commissioners said no.
"I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county," Commissioner Scott Carnahan said at last month's meeting. "I don't like 'em. It's fake news. And I'm voting no."
Asked Commissioner Jimmie T. Smith: "Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?"
Maybe, commissioner, because you want people to be informed.
Or maybe you don't.
As it turns out, the Citrus County Library System has a grand total of zero digital newspaper subscriptions for its 70,000 card holders, according to the Citrus County Chronicle.
Commissioners seem fine with that.
And that's the real issue here - a public library system that isn't fulfilling its own stated mission to "promote the pursuit of knowledge and deliver quality education to the community ... "
Before anyone gets worked into a lather, thinking this column is just a love letter to the Times, it's not.
The Times does outstanding journalism, but this is about something more - providing citizens with as much reliable information as possible. It's also about people who are scared of information that might challenge their preexisting opinions.
It may be mind-numbingly comfortable to bathe in the warm waters of bias confirmation. But it's not good for society's soul.
Local leaders shouldn't try to keep the Times out. They should try to bring the Wall Street Journal in. And The Washington Post. And the Citrus County Chronicle. And yeah, The New York Times.
Local information. National information. Analysis from the left and the right.
Print copies alone don't cut it anymore. All publishers know that. Cyber-delivery is the fastest-growing segment of newspapers and libraries alike.
It's about meeting consumers where they are - and also, as Commissioner Brian Coleman briefly acknowledged, serving an older or disabled population that might not be able to trek down to the library every day.
But none of that made a lick of difference to most Citrus County commissioners.
"Some of us support the president of the United States," Commissioner Ronald Kitchen said at a followup meeting this week. "I'm not backing off one inch."
Think about that comment for a moment. This is a man who equates supporting the president with denying his own library chief's request to share information with the people they both serve.
Some Citrus County residents showed up at Tuesday night's meeting to object.
"Access to information is at the heart of the library," one said. "You're elected to serve all of us, whether we're Republicans or Democrats," said another.
A retired school teacher wagged her finger at the board and barked: "This isn't the first time I've told young scalawags to stop talking and do your job!"
But commissioners had already made it clear they didn't want digital newspaper subscriptions infiltrating their library system.
"I don't feel like the county is obligated to subscribe to every major newspaper or every point of view," Commission Chairman Jeff Kinnard had said at the first meeting. "At some point you draw the line."
Apparently, Citrus County draws that line at zero.
The commission is scheduled to revisit this issue in two weeks.
And there's a solution ... if commissioners want it, anyway.
Instead of buying access to one paper (the Times) Citrus County could do what Orange County does - subscribe to distribution services that provide access to hundreds of papers.
They're not as user-friendly as individual subscriptions. Stories are just presented in list form. But in Orange County, anyone with a library card number and PIN can go to www.ocls.info/learning-research/articles-and-databases.
There, they can look for the link to "National Newspapers Core" to access the Wall Street Journal (with its right-leaning editorials), the New York Times (with its left-leaning ones) and several others.
The library spends $2,000 a month to offer that service to everyone in the county.
Why share so much information with so many people?
"We want people to use their library cards to learn, grow and connect to the world around them," said Orange library spokeswoman Erin Sullivan, "so we do our best to offer high-quality resources that offer people a chance to dig deeper and be more informed about current events, viewpoints and issues of local, national and global significance."
That concept seems pretty darn basic.
Especially for a library.

When I Faced Adam Schiff

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff recently revealed that, before he entered politics, he wanted to be a screenwriter. He even penned scripts for a courtroom drama and an action-filled spy thriller. Mr. Schiff, now leading the Democratic push to impeach President Trump, hasn't lost his theatrical flair.
He insisted for months that there was "ample evidence of collusion in plain sight" before the Mueller report blew that claim to hell. Then there was Mr. Schiff's opening statement for the impeachment proceedings, in which he reimagined Mr. Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, presenting an alternate script. It was largely panned as a B-movie "Godfather" rip-off.
Now the would-be dramatist is staging a new production: "Impeaching the President." His script features secret sessions in the Capitol basement, anonymous whistleblowers, constant and selective leaks of testimony, and, of course, a brilliant performance by the heroic lead.
Count me as a skeptic, and not only because we know how this drama is likely to end: with an almost straight party-line vote by the House to impeach Mr. Trump and a near-straight party-line vote by the Senate not to remove him from office.
I'm also skeptical because I was cast in an earlier Schiff production, following my September 2007 departure as deputy White House chief of staff. On May 22, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed me to answer questions regarding the Bush administration's removal of nine U.S. attorneys starting in 2006 and the prosecution of Don Siegelman, a former Democratic governor of Alabama, who was convicted in 2006 of bribery and fraud and sentenced to seven years.
A New York Times editorial supported the Judiciary Committee's demand, speculating that I "may have been directly involved" in the "possibly illegal firings" of the U.S. attorneys and claiming Mr. Siegelman's prosecution "appears to have been politically motivated." Never mind that U.S. attorneys serve at the president's pleasure, that all nine were removed for cause, and that a career deputy U.S. attorney with an impeccable reputation led Mr. Siegelman's prosecution.
An Alabama lawyer named Dana Jill Simpson stoked Mr. Siegelman's complaints that I had railroaded him. On "60 Minutes" and MSNBC, she alleged I recruited her as an opposition researcher to take down Mr. Siegelman because he threatened the GOP's hold on the White House. This was absurd: I never met Ms. Simpson, the governor was never going to be president, and her claims on TV sounded unhinged because they were.
None of this mattered. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers explained, "We're closing in on Rove. Someone's got to kick his ass."
The subpoena raised issues of executive privilege and was stalemated until the Obama administration intervened to broker a compromise. So on July 7, 2009, I met with Judiciary Committee staff for a day of questioning. On July 30, I appeared for nearly 10 hours before Mr. Schiff, the committee's designated interrogator.
He hadn't even prepared. His staff gave him a large notebook full of questions, which he was evidently seeing for the first time. There were long pauses as he reviewed questions before asking them. He was repetitive, leading my lawyer to object frequently that I had already answered a question several times. Mr. Schiff barely touched the Siegelman issue and never raised Ms. Simpson's accusations. His staffers later admitted to me that they found her a completely unreliable witness.
Following my appearance, in the interest of transparency, I gave my emails and other documents to reporters. I didn't want to wait for Messrs. Schiff and Conyers to spin the information and "kick my ass." Predictably, they accused me of sidestepping an agreement not to discuss my testimony. I'd never made any such agreement.
Soon Mr. Schiff wrote a Huffington Post article to get in his shots. He claimed his interviews of former White House counsel Harriet Miers and me revealed that "the White House brought an unprecedented level of partisan pressure to bear" in the decision to fire the U.S. attorneys, and raised the question of "whether criminal charges are warranted."
No criminal charges were ever filed by the special prosecutor who investigated the matter, but Mr. Schiff enjoyed his moment in the cable-news sun, even though the Siegelman issue somehow disappeared.
Now Mr. Schiff probably hopes the public impeachment hearings will allow him to reprise Tom Cruise's role in "A Few Good Men" as Lt. Daniel Kaffee -- "I want the truth!" But I know from experience that Mr. Schiff isn't much interested in the truth. He's more interested in drama, fiction and fame. His calm demeanor masks the heart of a fierce, untrustworthy partisan.

Texto completo: Southerners have a special affinity for their cast-iron skillets. Many are heirlooms with slick patinas seasoned with decades of chicken-frying and cornbread-baking. Others are modern adaptions designed to tap into our memory banks just like Grandma's did.
I know this sentiment well, and so does Anne Byrn, my longtime friend and former colleague at the AJC where we both once held the title of food editor. Even now, with more than a dozen cookbooks to her credit -- including the New York Times bestseller "The Cake Mix Doctor" and its sequels -- her tool of choice for everyday meals in Nashville is still the 12-inch Griswold skillet she bought decades ago at an Atlanta estate sale.
Yet much as she appreciated the way it seared salmon steaks on busy weeknights and griddled pancakes on Saturday mornings, she didn't think much about its potential beyond that until she poured her favorite pound cake batter into it on a whim. She was astounded by the result.
"The cake rose to a glorious height. The crust on top was golden and crackly, and the interior was even and smooth," she writes in the introduction to her newest cookbook. "In that instant, I fell in love. Yes, in love with my skillet."
In "Skillet Love: From Steak to Cake: More Than 150 Recipes in One Cast-Iron Pan" (Grand Central Publishing, $30), Byrn helps us understand why food cooked in cast iron tastes so good, and how we can capitalize on its capabilities. She walks us through 10 great techniques for using our skillets, from dry-roasting nuts to caramelizing onions, before moving on to the recipes -- all tested with one 12-inch skillet, with tips for adapting to a smaller one if that's all you've got.
Mixed in with classics like Country-Fried Steak and Georgia Burnt Caramel Cake are more contemporary creations such the ones I made for two terrific healthy dinners: Skillet-Seared Shrimp with Lemon-Basil Potlikker, and Picadillo Stuffed Peppers with Quinoa. I'd make either again, and save room for that skillet-sized Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie heaped with ice cream beckoning me in the Sweets chapter.
I thought my own trusty cast-iron skillet and I knew each other well. Clearly our relationship has just begun.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON >> Nancy Pelosi is issuing a pointed message to Democrats running for president in 2020: Those liberal ideas that fire up the party's base are a big loser when it comes to beating President Donald Trump.
Proposals pushed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders like Medicare for All and a wealth tax play well in liberal enclaves like her own district in San Francisco but won't sell in the Midwestern states that sent Trump to the White House in 2016, she said.
"What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan," Pelosi said at a roundtable of Bloomberg News reporters and editors on Friday. "What works in Michigan works in San Francisco talking about workers' rights and sharing prosperity."
"Remember November," she said. "You must win the Electoral College."
Pelosi was careful not to back any one candidate in the party's contentious presidential contest, but didn't hold back when asked about which ideas should and shouldn't form the party's case to American voters. Or about her fears that candidates like Warren and Sanders are going down the wrong track by courting only fellow progressives  and not the middle-of-the-road voters Democrats need to win back from Trump.
This is familiar ground for Pelosi, who has spent the year tussling with the "Squad," a vanguard of liberal newcomers to the House led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
"As a left-wing San Francisco liberal I can say to these people: What are you thinking?" Pelosi said. "You can ask the left they're unhappy with me for not being a socialist."
Her call for caution is backed by the authority she carries as a giant of Democratic politics who rose from the left wing of the party to become the first female speaker of the House and has earned grudging praise from her foes for her skill as a legislator.
She spoke as polls show a significant tightening of the race with Warren edging up on Joe Biden at the top of the field. A New York Times/Siena College survey of Iowa Democrats released Friday showed the top four candidates Warren, Sanders, Biden and Pete Buttigieg all bunched up in a five-point spread at the top of the field.
The speaker's concerns reflect those of many Democratic leaders and donors who believe that left-wing policies will alienate swing voters and lead to defeat.
Warren and Sanders are betting on a different theory that voters who float between parties are less ideological and can be inspired to vote for candidates who represent bold new change in Washington.
Pelosi said Democrats should seek to build on President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act instead of pushing ahead with the more sweeping Medicare for All plan favored by Warren and Sanders that would create a government-run health care system and abolish private insurance.
"Protect the Affordable Care Act I think that's the path to health care for all Americans. Medicare For All has its complications," Pelosi said, adding that "the Affordable Care Act is a better benefit than Medicare."
Warren has been under pressure from Biden and other candidates to demonstrate that her plan wouldn't require tax increases on middle-class Americans.
On Friday, her campaign said it would cost $20.5 trillion and would be funded by raising taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, cracking down on tax evasion, reducing defense spending and putting newly legalized immigrants on the tax rolls. The Biden campaign called that plan "mathematical gymnastics" intended to hide the fact that it would result in higher taxes for the middle class.
Warren swatted back at the criticism, accusing Biden of "running in the wrong presidential primary."
"Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points," the Massachusetts senator said in Des Moines, Iowa. "So, if Biden doesn't like that, I'm just not sure where he's going."
Pelosi also expressed worries about voters' reactions to the Green New Deal, which Sanders and Warren also support, that calls for radical, rapid reductions in carbon emissions. "There's very strong opposition on the labor side to the Green New Deal because it's like 10 years, no more fossil fuel. Really?" she said.
Pelosi said Democrats must stick with pay-as-you-go rules to avoid adding to the debt, a point of contention with left-leaning figures who want to permit more deficit spending for ambitious liberal priorities.
"We cannot just keep increasing the debt," she said.
Pelosi added that she doesn't understand the race to the left among some candidates, because "Bernie and Elizabeth own the left, right? Is anybody going to out-left them?"
She stopped short of endorsing a tax on wealth, an idea that Warren and Sanders have embraced as a means to reduce income inequality and expand the safety net. The speaker said she wants "bipartisan" tax changes that lower the debt and fix the "dumb" Republican tax cuts of 2017.
She also steered clear of backing a cap on pay for chief executive officers.
The speaker, who recently led the House to formally vote on an impeachment inquiry into Trump, said the most critical question candidates should be answering for voters is why they should be president.
"Show them what's in your heart, your hopes and dreams," she said. "It's not about you. It's about them."

EARLY ORGANIZING KEY TO RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN 2020; COMMENTARY

Texto completo: This past weekend, I knocked on strangers' doors in La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Portage to talk about the 2020 elections. And I wasn't alone. Thousands of volunteers knocked on more than 50,000 doors last weekend one year out from the 2020 election. It was a wave of organizing unprecedented in scope this far from an election.
Never have so many done so much, so early. Why do it? Three reasons: because Wisconsin is the pivotal state to defeat Trump; because good organizing takes time; and because, if we're serious about not taking anyone for granted or writing anyone off, we can't just show up a few weeks before the election.
Wisconsin is the state that could decide it all. As data wizard Nate Cohn wrote in the New York Times, "Wisconsin was the tipping-point state in 2016, and it seems to hold that distinction now." All the states where Trump is more popular than he is in Wisconsin don't add up to enough Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Neither do all the states where Trump is less popular than he is in Wisconsin. So, if the Electoral College vote is close, Wisconsin is the most likely state to tip the balance.
Wisconsin was the closest state in the country in the 2004 presidential election. In 2000, the vote was even closer just a 5,708-vote margin. Trump's under-1% margin of victory in 2016 was a return to form.
After the 2016 loss, my predecessor chair at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, Martha Laning, took a long look at what had worked in organizing for 2008 and 2012 and what hadn't worked in 2016. The lesson: start early, and build from the bottom up.
Since the spring of 2017, our party has been applying that lesson, running a field organizing program year-round that is focused on building neighborhood teams in which volunteers are empowered to organize their own communities. In 2018, the neighborhood team model earned its stripes, mobilizing volunteers to knock on nearly twice as many doors as the 2016 presidential campaign, at half the cost. Those same teams powered our massive One Year to Win canvass this past weekend.
The stakes are simply too high to do anything else. Every issue we care about is on the line in 2020. Meeting people where they are, and taking their concerns seriously, is the essence of democracy. We want to be a Democratic Party that lives up to our name. And if we do, we can help restore and renew democracy itself to our state, and to our country.

Masacró a una familia y ahora decidió cambiarse de sexo en prisión

Texto completo: Steven J. Hayes, quien cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por una masacre familiar en Connecticut, está recibiendo terapia hormonal en prisión como parte de una transición de género.
El recluso discutió su plan de cambio de sexo durante una serie de entrevistas telefónicas recientes con Joe Tomaso para el podcast “15 Minutes With…”, informó The New York Times.
Hayes, de 56 años, se encuentra en la prisión estatal Greene en Waynesburg, Pensilvania, después de ser transferido en 2016 como parte de un acuerdo interestatal.
Cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por los asesinatos de Jennifer Hawke-Petit (48) y sus dos hijas, Michaela (11) y Hayley (17), cometidos el 23 de julio de 2007.
“Hay muchos problemas con (mi) presentación como mujer”, dijo Hayes en el podcast. “Mucha gente lo acepta, pero en esta instalación, hay muchos racistas y fanáticos en el personal y no están contentos con eso. Hay dos de nosotros aquí que somos femeninas”.
Hayes todavía usaba el nombre Steven en el podcast, y no dijo cómo prefería ser llamado.
Afirmó tener un diagnóstico médico de disforia de género, en el que la apariencia externa de una persona no se alinea con su estado mental y emocional, y un problema recurrente de drogas.
“Soy transgénero”, dijo Hayes. “Me diagnosticaron a los 16 años con trastorno de identidad sexual. Mi familia nunca lo reconoció y nunca fui tratado”.
Maria Finn, portavoz del Departamento de Correcciones de Pensilvania , dijo que no podía comentar sobre un preso específico, pero comentó que había 222 personas transgénero en instituciones penales estatales.
Finn dijo que el sistema penitenciario estatal no paga las cirugías de afirmación de género, pero gasta $60 mil dólares al año en total y hasta $600 por interno en medicamentos para tratar a quienes tienen disforia de género. Los costos anuales de atención médica promedian $5,582 por recluso, según la vocera.
Además de la terapia hormonal, Hayes habló en el podcast de tratar de obtener “otras cosas” como parte del proceso de transición de género, pero no dio más detalles.
Originalmente Hayes recibió la pena de muerte por la invasión del hogar de Hawke-Petit, junto con un cómplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, cuya apelación de condena será juzgada por la Corte Suprema de Connecticut.
Ambos fueron condenados a cadena perpetua después de que Connecticut abolió la pena de muerte en 2012, enojando a los partidarios de la pena capital y a los defensores de las víctimas, quienes dijeron que la derogación tenía la intención de ser prospectiva y no aplicable a los reclusos que ya estaban en el corredor de la muerte.
En el ínterin, Hayes se convirtió en judío ortodoxo en la cárcel.
Durante el podcast, expresó su remordimiento por los asesinatos y criticó la apelación de Komisarjevsky.
“No hay defensa para lo que hicimos”, dijo. “No quiero formar parte de este juicio. La familia ya no merece pasar por esto”.
Hayes y Komisarjevsky rastrearon a Hawke-Petit y sus dos hijas desde un supermercado cercano hasta su casa en Cheshire (Connecticut), donde las víctimas fueron retenidas como rehenes, agredidas sexualmente y rociadas con gasolina antes de que su casa fuera incendiada.
Antes de matarlas, Hayes obligó Hawke-Petit a ir a un banco local, donde retiró $15 mil dólares, mientras Komisarjevsky esperaba en la casa de la familia con las dos hijas, de 11 y 17 años.
El único sobreviviente del ataque, el Dr. William Petit Jr., un endocrinólogo que era el esposo y el padre de las víctimas, fue brutalmente golpeado con un bate de béisbol durante la invasión. En 2016 fue elegido miembro de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, por el Partido Republicano.
Hayes habló de haber tenido una recaída de drogas y estar en dificultades financieras en el momento de la invasión de la casa. “No era un monstruo”, afirmó sobre el triple homicidio.

Texto completo: More rich and diverse offerings are happening at SOMOS Salon & Bookstore for this year's Prose Month.
Opening act
On Saturday (Nov. 2), SOMOS hosted the first of many readings this month. In anticipation of the 7 p.m. reading by Mirabai Starr, Rabbi Judith HaLevy and Debora Seidman, the audience began to hush itself at five minutes before the hour. Members of the eager ensemble of listeners seemed to know that a special evening was in store for them, and they lowered their voices to whispers of their own accord.
Curator Johanna DeBiase introduced the trio, joking about the unintentional creation of a "Jewish Ladies Night" of readers. The unplanned harmony continued with the reading itself; all three readers chose selections about their mothers.
The reading began with a re-creation of Shabbat in miniature: two candles, a cup, a loaf of challah set on a cloth, all on a brass tray. "On the last night of my mother's life, my sister-in-law Anita brings Shabbat into the hospital," Seidman read from her memoir in progress, "Lost and Found in My Mother's Kitchen." Seidman created an intimate portrait of a complicated relationship through the objects, actions and feelings that fill our daily lives: casserole dishes, soup bowls, caregiving and forgiveness.
The theme of the importance of objects that fill our minds and days continued in the humorous reflections of HaLevy, who claimed, "It's all about the shoes," while offering incisive reflections on what it means to honor our mothers (and fathers) and on wise aging. "The first step to wise aging is a ruthless inventory of the shoeboxes clogging your closet," Rabbi Judith read, itemizing her own four-inch spikes, thigh-high boots and the like. After earnest reflection, she decides that, rather than give them to her daughter-in-law, the garbage is the most suitable place for the "painfully tight family traumas.
"At the end of this curve, it's just too much weight to carry."
DeBiase acknowledged that the final reader of the evening, Mirabai Starr, likely needed little introduction, and Starr opened with appreciation for the two readings before her, and for her brother, Roy, who was there with her, selling books.
Starr then shared her freshest writing, written that very evening - a moving draft of a forward to a collection of writings by her dear friend Elaine Sutton, who passed away in 2017. She ended with an essay about her own mother published this year on Mother's Day in The New York Times . "She modeled for me what it looks like to shatter and mend," Starr read, and to be "open to the amazement in the face of life's small beauties."
Insights into process from Mirabai Starr
Every writer develops her own process, and Starr generously shared some of hers with the Taos News . As she is usually writing on deadline, Starr has learned to write at any time. In a typical writing session, in a space of total solitude and silence, she begins with timed free writing from a Natalie Goldberg prompt and writes "without any filter." Then, with raw material to work with, she sets to refining it, guided by sculptor and painter Michelangelo's reflection: "I saw an angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."
Coming up this week
Curator DeBiase said she wishes to "represent a variety of different types of prose for audiences to get a feel for all the possibilities," and this week's offerings reflect that intention. From fiction in progress today to playwriting Friday evening and during Saturday's workshop, humor on Saturday evening and memoir on Sunday evening.
Today (Nov. 7) at 5 p.m. listeners will be offered the opportunity to hear fiction in progress. Members of Taos' No Coast Writers group, Christine Autumn, Krystal Cretecos and Lauren Bjorkman, will share from their latest projects. Autumn is well-known in Taos for her singing, art and teaching and is completing a book of fiction. Cretecos, who focused mostly on poetry in the past, is working on "a blend of a magical realism memoir and cyber-punk-esque sci-fi novel." Bjorkman is the author of two young adult novels, "My Invented Life" and "Miss Fortune Cookie."
Friday (Nov. 8) at 7 p.m., Ned Dougherty presents Playwright Night, where playwrights will read their own work, offering an uncommon view of both their inspiration and the subject matters of their work. "This event was very successful last year," DeBiase said. "Many people told me they had been wanting to see something like this." Two Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico fellows, Erick Forrest Jackson and Kim Merrill, "are well-established playwrights, doing amazing things in their field," DiBiase said. She invited them both. Jackson and Merrill are award-winning dramatists who works have been produced widely.
For those who would like to learn more about playwriting and how these techniques can enrich their own writing, host Ned Dougherty will be teaching a workshop "Playwriting Fun01: Exploring the Building Blocks of a Scene" Saturday (Nov. 9) from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m.
Saturday (Nov. 9) at 7 p.m. will be a reading by humorists Eddie Tafoya from Albuquerque and Robert Wilder of Santa Fe. DiBiase said, "If you want a good laugh, come to this reading." Tafoya is a stand-up comedian and professor of creative writing at New Mexico Highlands University. His most recent book, "The Marxist Revolution," will be released next year, and he has appeared on several television shows, including "The After After Party."
For close to a decade, Wilder contributed a monthly column, "Daddy Needs a Drink," to the Santa Fe Reporter , and he has published a book of essays by the same title, as well as one titled "Tales from the Teachers' Lounge." He has appeared on numerous radio programs and published his essays widely, as well as written a well-reviewed debut novel, "Nickel."
Sunday (Nov. 10) at 5 p.m., "well-loved local writers and partners" Jim Levy and Phaedra Greenwood will individually present their work. Both have published widely. Most recently, they published, "Those Were the Days: Life and Love in 1970s Northern New Mexico," a joint memoir.
Continuing throughout the month
Anyone who would like two hours of scheduled, uninterrupted writing is invited to attend the weekly write-ins to take place at SOMOS on Wednesdays from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 2 p.m.
All events take place at SOMOS Salon & Bookstore at 108B Civic Plaza Drive, Taos. They are $8; $5 for members. For more information, contact SOMOS at (575) 758-0081 or somos@somostaos.org or visit somostaos.org.

Texto completo: I've been feeling this strange sensation.
It started on Wednesday morning, and it is not at all unpleasant. I feel warmth for my fellow citizens to the south. And, weirdly, less dread about the future of the entire country. In place of leaden despair, there is something lighter.
Wait. Could this be . . . hope?
It's been a while, but still, I'm pretty sure this is what it used to feel like: The sense that every single thing is not, in fact, going to hell. That, at least sometimes, basic standards of decency will prevail. That, even in the unlikeliest places, enough voters still exist to reject those who say and do awful things.
Can we start with Kentucky? In that deep red state, voters delivered a spectacular, if narrow, victory to Democrat Andy Beshear over incumbent governor and Donald Trump fanboy Matt Bevin on Tuesday. Bevin isn't likely to concede any time soon, and it looks like Republican lawmakers will try to keep him in the corner office by whatever means they can conjure. But his loss has got to smart if you're a Trump cultist in that part of the world.
The president, who won the state by 30 points in 2016, begged voters at a Monday rally to reelect Bevin, who had said and done so many offensive and nutty things that it was easy to see why he and Trump were buds.
“If you lose, they're going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world," Trump told rally-goers. “You can't let that happen to me!"
Oof! They let it happen to him. Like being booed at a baseball game and at an UFC fight, that has got to sting. You have to think that Bevin's loss — especially among suburban voters — will sow a little fear in Trumpland: Why, perhaps even soulless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell — also of Kentucky — is rethinking his blind fealty to his president, or at least losing a little sleep.
Then again, nah. Mitch is a man without honor, and Bevin's loss was mostly about Bevin.
For heartening change that will stick, look to Virginia, where voters delivered Democratic majorities in both chambers of state government, revealing a commonwealth that is now reliably blue, and good with women candidates, who made many of the gains.
With Democratic majorities, Virginia can now make serious progress: Legislators can undo Republican gerrymandering (imagine, the party that wins a majority of votes winning a majority of seats!), raise the minimum wage, enact gun safety laws, and even force a national discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine equal protections for women in the US Constitution. Delightful!
Closer to home, where we're spoiled for good news, there was plenty of it on Tuesday night. Jasiel Correia is leaving the mayor's office in Fall River: It seems that enough voters there finally see that he didn't have their best interests at heart. A truckload of federal indictments for fraud and corruption might have been the tip-off there.
And in Boston, voters elected a City Council dominated by women, progressives, and people of color — many of them big thinkers with powerful ambitions for themselves and the city. It's no less than residents of this majority-minority city — and its pressing problems — deserve.
Such progress warms the heart. Why, it almost makes one optimistic about the future.
Until reality intrudes to crush the election's sugar rush. Nobody with my inbox could stay hopeful for long, anyway. After all, Trump is still president, the man and his cruel policies enabled by a GOP that appears determined to look the other way, even as evidence piles up of impeachable offenses.
Worse, as a New York Times poll earlier this week revealed, he might yet win reelection because, though he trails in national polls, Trump is still formidable in the battleground states that carried him to Electoral College victory in 2016. And, worse still, there remain plenty of voters — even among those inclined to choose a Democrat for president — who are turned off by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren solely because she's a woman. Female presidential candidates are “super unlikable," one respondent said. In 2019.
Ah, there is that familiar leaden thing again.
Hello darkness, my old friend.

Texto completo: New York Times Co. reported strong digital-subscription growth in the third quarter, but earnings suffered from a drop in advertising revenue, which the company said would accelerate in the following quarter.
The Times reported net income of $16.4 million, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter, down 34% from $25 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis to exclude severance and some retirement costs, the company reported earnings per share of 12 cents.
Revenue rose 2.7% to $428.5 million from $417.3 million in the third quarter last year, driven by a 3.7% increase in subscription revenue and a 26% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from the Times's new television program, "The Weekly."
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast adjusted earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $429.1 million.
Advertising revenue fell 6.7% to $113.5 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 5.4% to $54.7 million, while print advertising revenue dropped 7.9% to $58.9 million.
The company forecast that both total advertising revenue and digital advertising revenue would fall in the fourth quarter by midteen percent from the year-earlier period.
"Like other publishers, we're seeing continued turbulence in the digital advertising space," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said in a statement. "We expect a fairly challenging fourth quarter."
Times shares were 4% lower in morning trading in New York. The stock remains up more than 35% so far this year.
Operating costs for the quarter rose 5.4% to $401.5 million, driven by the cost of an expanding newsroom and product development team—and increased costs related to the paper's new television series, "The Weekly." The company says it now employs 1,700 newsroom staffers, an all-time high.
Marketing expenses, which had been rising in recent quarters as part of an effort to boost digital subscriptions, declined in the third quarter to $38.4 million from $40.4 million a year earlier.
The company expects operating costs to increase in the fourth quarter by low-single digit percent and even higher in 2020.
Digital-subscription growth continued with 273,000 additional customers in the quarter. Of those, 209,000 signed up to the paper's core news offering and 64,000 for its lower-cost cooking and crossword apps.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 4.1 million paid digital subscribers—3.2 million for core news and 0.9 million for the cooking and crossword apps. About half a million subscribers came from international markets. Including print subscribers, the Times had 4.9 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
"We are clearly seeing acceleration of our digital subscription model," said Mr. Thompson said later Wednesday during a call with analysts. "The weight and complexity of the stories—impeachment, Brexit, Boeing and so on—plays to the strength of Times journalism."
He said the company was confident that it would reach its goal of 10 million total subscriptions by 2025, and projected that two million of those will come from international markets.
Subscription revenue rose to $267.3 million from $257.8 million a year earlier. That was driven by an increase in revenue from digital subscriptions, which rose 14.5% on the year to $115.9 million.
The company forecast low-to-mid-single digit growth in the subscription revenue for the fourth quarter with digital-only subscription revenue rising by midteen percent.
Other revenue rose to $47.7 million in the quarter from $37.9 million the year before and was expected to increase further in the next quarter due to revenue from a licensing deal the Times has signed with Facebook Inc. to contribute content to the social-media platform's recently launched news product.
"This is the first time that a Silicon Valley major has recognized the value of Times journalism to its platform and has agreed to pay a substantial fee for it," Mr. Thompson said. The company didn't disclose the terms of the deal.
Facebook has reached licensing deals with numerous news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal's parent company, News Corp, to participate in its news product. In all, the product will include news from some 200 publications, although many aren't being paid licensing fees.

Reports: US launches review of China-owned video app TikTok

Texto completo: Multiple published reports say that the U.S. government has launched a national-security review of the China-owned video app TikTok, popular with millions of U.S. teens and young adults.
The reports Friday from Reuters,The New York Times and others said that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions by foreign firms, has opened an inquiry into TikTok owner ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a predecessor app, Musical.ly.
Several senators have recently noted concerns about censorship and data collection on TikTok.
The Treasury Department, which houses CFIUS, said it does not comment on specific cases because the agency by law cannot disclose to the public information filed to it.
TikTok said it cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes. But it said it "has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so."
After acquiring Musical.ly, Beijing-based ByteDance merged it into TikTok. Musical.ly, popular in the U.S. and Europe, had operated out of offices in Shanghai and California.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last month sent a letter to Treasury requesting a CFIUS review of the national-security implications of the Musical.ly deal, saying there is "ample and growing evidence" that TikTok is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government. In the letter, he said there had been questions about why the app had so few videos of the recent protests in Hong Kong.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) later in October asked for the U.S. intelligence community to assess national-security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned content platforms in the U.S. They said that while TikTok says it stores U.S. user data in the U.S., the company must still adhere to Chinese law on supplying information to the government. Such accusations have also been leveled against other Chinese companies, including Huawei.
The senators also said that TikTok is a potential target of foreign influence campaigns similar to Russia's attempts to undermine the 2016 U.S. election on Facebook.
TikTok has said its data is not subject to Chinese law and that it does not remove content based on "sensitivities related to China."
On the app, people share short videos, often set to music. They lip-sync and dance to songs, do silly pranks and share other bits of their lives. It's searchable by user names, songs and hashtags, like "thisishalloween" or "tiktokcats."
The government has stepped in several times over the past few years to block or break up Chinese deals. A Chinese company that owns the gay dating app Grindr reportedly agreed to sell it earlier this year after a CFIUS review. Broadcom, based in Singapore, was stopped from going after U.S. chip maker Qualcomm because of U.S. national-security concerns over losing dominance in the race to for leadership in "5G" wireless, particularly to China. Qualcomm is a major telecom supplier.

Why the media resists naming whistleblower

Texto completo: President Trump and his allies say there's a gaping hole in the middle of the biggest news story in years: the name of the federal whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry that now threatens Trump's presidency.
They've called on news organizations to reveal the name of the CIA officer who first raised concerns about Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine. Yet despite apparent knowledge of the individual's identity among people in Washington, his name hasn't been widely reported.
One online publication, Real Clear Investigations, offered a lengthy, if unconfirmed, account about the whistleblower's identity last week. But its reporting was largely ignored. Outside of a few conservative news sources such as RedState.com and Breitbart and personalities such as Rush Limbaugh, the story didn't get much traction.
How come?
The answer appears to lie in several factors: concerns that revealing the name could jeopardize the whistleblower's safety; legal questions about whether the whistleblower's identity is protected by federal law; and potential adverse public reaction to such a disclosure. There's also a question about whether the person identified in news accounts and bandied about the Internet so far actually is the whistleblower.
Trump has repeatedly said he deserves to know the identity of his accuser. His allies have made similar calls; at a Trump reelection rally in Kentucky Monday night, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) demanded the news media disclose it. "Do your job and print his name," he said.
Some in the media say the whistleblower's identity is less newsworthy now that multiple federal officials have corroborated elements of his or her complaint that Trump allegedly strong-armed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call, insisting that his government investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic rival, and his son, Hunter.
"I'm not convinced his identity is important at this point, or at least important enough to put him at any risk, or to unmask someone who doesn't want to be identified," said Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times. "Pretty much everything has now been discussed or confirmed on the record, multiple times, by others in the administration. So I'm not sure I see the point of unmasking someone who wants to remain anonymous."
The Washington Post, the Times and the Associated Press have reported that the whistleblower is a male CIA officer, but none has identified the individual.
Both Baquet and AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said the intelligence community connection was an important part of the story because - at least at that point several weeks ago - readers had very little information by which to assess the value or veracity of the whistleblower's complaint.
Easton said Tuesday that the AP has continued to keep the name under wraps because "AP typically refrains from identifying whistleblowers." She did not explain why.
Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti said The Post wasn't naming an individual because it "has long respected the right of whistleblowers to report wrongdoing in confidence, which protects them against retaliation."
She added, "We also withhold identities or other facts when we believe that publication would put an individual at risk. Both of those considerations apply in this case."
Other news organizations didn't respond to requests for comment, or were terse in reply. The Wall Street Journal and Fox News declined to explain their approach. NBC News said it wasn't naming the individual "until or unless they identify themselves publicly." It also did not say why.
CNN had no response.
On Monday, Fox News host Sean Hannity suggested on his program that he knew the name of the whistleblower but was withholding it because of alleged legal threats. "I actually have multiple confirmations of who the whistleblower is," he said on the air. "But you know what? I'll play the game for a little bit, and I'll take the lawyers' threats that they're going to sue me." Such a lawsuit, he said, "wouldn't go anywhere."
Reporters frequently withhold names of sources. They also don't reveal the names of victims of certain crimes, such as rape. But neither of those circumstances apply to a whistleblower.
The mainstream media's silence is puzzling to Tom Kuntz, the editor of Real Clear Investigations (RCI), which published its whistleblower investigation last week.
"The silence has been deafening," he said. "It's almost like there's a code of omerta [the Mafia vow of silence] about what media organizations can report. . . . There's a herd mentality and a reluctance to cut against the grain."
RCI is an offshoot of Real Clear Media, a digital company best known for Real Clear Politics, a site that aggregates a wide spectrum of political reporting and commentary and produces original work. RCI is funded by a nonprofit foundation associated with the for-profit company.
Kuntz says journalists should identify newsworthy sources whenever they can, so that readers or viewers can judge their credibility for themselves. In the case of someone asserting that a crime had been committed, he argued that it's also a question of fairness and due process. That is, Trump should be able to face his accuser, as Trump himself has argued.
However, the whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, has said that revealing the whistleblower's name could subject him to physical or professional reprisals and could discourage future whistleblowers from coming forward. Zaid has said he would never confirm or deny the identity of his client.
But both Kuntz and Baquet disputed the notion, advanced by Hannity, that a news organization would face legal consequences by publishing the name.
In nearly a week since publishing its story, RCI hasn't received any legal threats, Kuntz said. Baquet said he didn't foresee any such penalty, either, "especially if there was a truly compelling journalistic reason" for disclosing the name.

Texto completo: People on social media blasted the New York Times for a Twitter headline that seemingly minimized the deaths of nine members of an American family in Mexico and implied their religion was to blame.
The headline on Twitter read, “Brutal Killings Spotlight Small Religious Sect in Mexico,” with a description that said, “The brutal killing of 9 members of an American family in northern Mexico on Monday highlights the long history of religious fundamentalist settlers in the region. Our religion reporter, Elizabeth Dias, details their history back to the early 20th century.”
Tweet
The article, penned by a religion reporter, has the headline, “Murder in Mexico: Mormon Families Have a Long History There,” and goes in-depth about a fundamentalist offshoot of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and how they settled in the region decades ago after splintering off from the Mormons.
On social media, some said the tweet was tone deaf in light of the six children and three women who were slaughtered by gunmen on Monday.
Tweet TweetTweetTweet
Some drew parallels between the tweet and when the Washington Post briefly changed the headline of its obituary for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi to refer to him as an “austere religious scholar.”
Tweet Tweet Tweet
The women and children killed Monday were part of the LeBarón family. The assailants, who have not been identified, shot and killed several of the victims, while others were trapped inside a burning vehicle.

Texto completo: President Trump offered U.S. military support to Mexico after a Mormon family with U.S. citizenship was massacred.
At least six American children and three women were killed when they were ambushed in northern Mexico on Monday, members of the LeBarón family said.
Trump tweeted Tuesday that the family “got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other.”
“If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted.
“This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!” he said.
Tweet Tweet
Julian LeBarón, a cousin of the three women who were driving the vehicles, told the New York Times that one of the women, Rhonita, was on her way to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning home to celebrate their wedding anniversary when her car broke down.
The gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car,” he said. The woman, a 9-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy, and twins less than a year old were killed, he said.
When the rest of the group returned to the first car, they were also ambushed.
“Six little kids were killed, and seven made it out alive,” LeBarón said.
The LeBarón family settled in Mexico decades ago after disagreeing with the central church over polygamy.
Kenny LeBarón, another cousin of the women, said much of his family now lives in North Dakota, but they regularly travel to Mexico for holidays and vacations.

Bret Stephens: The NeverTrumpers are vindicated

Texto completo: Even by Donald Trump’s standards, his tweet of Oct. 23 — the one that called NeverTrumpers “human scum” — plumbed new depths in the debasement of presidential speech.
But what else has changed? If Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic, were given the job of finding Trump’s moral bottom, he’d fail.
Far more revealing in Trump’s tweet was its first sentence. “The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats,” the president wrote, before warning of their scummy natures.
Think that one over. If the few remaining NeverTrump conservatives can still be that dangerous while we’re on respirators, we must be powerful indeed. Somewhere in eternity’s permanent exile, Leon Trotsky is smiling.
Yet Trump’s tweet is basically right on both counts. As a movement, NeverTrumpism is on life support. And the president has greater reasons than ever to fear it.
Three years ago, on the eve of the election, the NeverTrump coalition was a wide one, ranging from hard-core conservatives like Erick Erickson and Ted Cruz to somewhat squishier ones like Michael Gerson, John Podhoretz and, well, me.
Then Trump won. The guy who was supposed to lead his party to a catastrophic defeat became the man who, in the eyes of the right, uniquely figured out how to save the country from Hillary Clinton. The coarseness of speech and crudeness of character that were supposed to be his central flaws became evidence of his gutsy indifference to liberal reproach.
There were also those conservative policy and political victories. Regulatory rollback. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and all the lower court judges. Increased military spending. The tax cut. Withdrawal from the Iran deal. An expanded GOP majority in the Senate. The Mueller fizzle.
The NeverTrumpers scattered. Some became ex-conservatives. Others, full-on Trumpers. Still others, anti-anti-Trumpers — which only meant they were smart enough to see the president for what he is and churlish enough to be angry at those who wouldn’t join them in capitulating to it.
Yet the NeverTrumpers never scattered entirely, and thank heavens for that. Every political system will always have a conservative faction, and every healthy democracy needs that faction to be rooted in some combination of classical liberalism and moral traditionalism. Trump’s GOP, whatever its political fortunes, is the opposite: a nativist party led by a libertine.
At some level, conservatives know this. Trump knows they know it. Which explains why he has turned his sights on NeverTrumpers: What despots and demagogues fear most is their followers developing a conscience.
No wonder the president chose to lambaste Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as a “Never Trumper.” The combat veteran had the simple decency of being scandalized by what he heard from the president on the Ukraine phone call, and by what he knew of the discrepancies between what he heard on the call and the account of it released by the White House.
The decency of being scandalized is what being NeverTrump is centrally about, and why the movement remains important. It’s the opposite of the opportunism required to go along with the president because you might get something out of him.
It’s the same sense of scandal that led to the first significant GOP revolt against Trump since John McCain turned his thumb down on Obamacare repeal in 2017: the suppurating disgust even pliant conservatives like Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham feel at Trump’s cavalier betrayal of the Kurds. It could motivate John Bolton (a born-again NeverTrumper, along with John Kelly, Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, Anthony Scaramucci and everyone else who made the mistake of working for this president) to deliver what may yet be the most devastating insider’s indictment of the president’s shameless shadow foreign policy.
And it helps explain why the president’s support with his base is slipping at last. A new poll finds Trump’s support among Republicans at 74% — an 8-point decline since September and the lowest since he was elected. Nearly 1 in 5 Republicans support impeachment and removal. So do 47% of independents. These numbers will not move in Trump’s favor if the truth about his drug deals (to borrow Bolton’s phrase) continues to come to light.
I doubt any of this will be sufficient to get at least 20 Republican senators to vote for Trump’s removal from office. But Trump knows that the number needed to spell his moral defeat on impeachment is four. If Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and one other Republican join the Democrats to convict, the political humiliation will be thunderous. And, as my colleague David Leonhardt has convinced me, it could devastate his re-election chances. If the administration thinks impeachment is such a political winner, they wouldn’t be fighting it this hard.
In the meantime, someone ought to print “Human Scum” on a limited-edition T-shirt. Given who said it about whom, it turns out to be a badge of honor.

Paul Krugman: Elizabeth Warren and the Wrath of the Wall Street Snowflakes

Texto completo: Given all the recent focus on health policy, you might think that the medical-industrial complex would be heavily involved in the Democratic primary race, going all out to block Elizabeth Warren. And a coalition of drug companies, insurers and hospitals is indeed running ads attacking “Medicare for All.”
But the health industry’s political role has been relatively muted so far. Partly this may reflect realism: Even if Warren becomes president, the chances of getting Medicare for All through Congress are small. It may also reflect the surprising openness of doctors to reform. While the American Medical Association still officially opposes single-payer, at a recent meeting, 47% of the delegates voted to drop that opposition.
No, the really intense backlash against Warren and progressive Democrats in general is coming from Wall Street. And while that opposition partly reflects self-interest, Wall Street’s Warren hatred has a level of virulence, sometimes crossing into hysteria, that goes beyond normal political calculation.
What’s behind that virulence?
First, let’s talk about the rational reasons Wall Street is worried about Warren. She is, of course, calling for major tax increases on the very wealthy, those with wealth exceeding $50 million, and the financial industry is strongly represented in that elite club. And since raising taxes on the wealthy is highly popular, it’s an idea a progressive president might actually be able to turn into real policy.
Warren is also a big believer in stricter financial regulation; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was highly effective until the Trump administration set about gutting it, was her brainchild.
So if you are a Wall Street billionaire, rational self-interest might well induce you to oppose Warren. Rationality does not, however, explain why a money manager like Leon Cooperman — who just two years ago settled a suit over insider trading for $5 million, although without admitting wrongdoing — would circulate an embarrassing, self-pitying open letter denouncing Warren for her failure to appreciate all the wonderful things billionaires like him do for society.
Nor does it explain why Cliff Asness, another money manager, would fly into a rage at Warren adviser Gabriel Zucman for using the term “revenue maximizing” — a standard piece of economic jargon — describing it as “disgustingly immoral.”
The real tell here, I think, is that much of the Wall Street vitriol now being directed at Warren was previously directed at, of all people, President Barack Obama.
Objectively, Obama treated Wall Street with kid gloves. In the aftermath of a devastating financial crisis, his administration bailed out collapsing institutions on favorable terms. He and Democrats in Congress did impose some new regulations, but they were very mild compared with the regulations put in place after the banking crisis of the 1930s.
He did, however, refer on a few occasions to “fat cat” bankers and suggested that financial-industry excesses were responsible for the 2008 crisis because, well, they were. And the result, quite early in his administration, was that Wall Street became consumed with “Obama rage,” and the financial industry went all in for Mitt Romney in 2012.
I wonder, by the way, if this history helps explain an odd aspect of fundraising in the current primary campaign. It’s not surprising that Warren is getting very little money from the financial sector. It is, however, surprising that the top recipient isn’t Joe Biden but Pete Buttigieg, who’s running a fairly distant fourth in the polls. Is Biden suffering from the lingering effects of that old-time Obama rage?
In any case, the point is that Wall Street billionaires, even more than billionaires in general, seem to be snowflakes, emotionally unable to handle criticism.
I’m not sure why that should be the case, but it may be that in their hearts they suspect that the critics have a point.
What, after all, does modern finance actually do for the economy? Unlike the robber barons of yore, today’s Wall Street tycoons don’t build anything tangible. They don’t even direct money to the people who actually are building the industries of the future. The vast expansion of credit in America after around 1980 basically involved a surge in consumer debt rather than new money for business investment.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that when the financial sector gets too big it actually acts as a drag on the economy — and America is well past that point.
Now, human nature being what it is, people who secretly wonder whether they really deserve their wealth get especially angry when others express these doubts publicly. So it’s not surprising that people who couldn’t handle Obama’s mild, polite criticism are completely losing it over Warren.
What this means is that you should beware of Wall Street claims that progressive policies would have dire effects. Such claims don’t reflect deep economic wisdom; to a large extent they’re coming from people with vast wealth but fragile egos, whose rants should be discounted appropriately.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday.
Trump – who has a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58% – trails by sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%); Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%).
Each of those Democratic candidates performed well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and all of them expanded those leads in this week's survey.
Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances.
Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that "the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020" won't start coming out until after the holiday season.
'I have the real polls': Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment
"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states," Johnson said. "But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points. "
MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there "literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national more than a year out from the election. "
"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident," he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College.
A recent poll from The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona.
More: Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds
According to the Post-ABC poll, most Americans share negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say they don't think the president is "honest and trustworthy," 62% say he lacks presidential temperament, 60% say he does not understand their problems, 55% say he is not good at making political deals and 54% say he is not a strong leader.
Fifty-four percent say the United States is less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable.
Forty-nine percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill Clinton's impeachment at 27% to 41% in 1998.
Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U. S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did something wrong – though 8% say they don't think it was a serious matter.
Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and 30% say they would prefer someone else.

Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
When asked who has the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say Biden, 17% say Warren and 16% say Sanders.
The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 using a random sample of 1,003 adults, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 5%.

Texto completo: She was also nominated for a Tony for her performance in the title role of "Anna Karenina" and was a member of the original cast of "Les Misérables."
Ann Crumb, the actress and singer who starred in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Aspects of Love" in both London and New York, died on Thursday at her parents' home in Media, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 69.
Kevin McAnarney, her publicist, said the cause was ovarian cancer, which was diagnosed in 2015.
Ms. Crumb starred in "Aspects of Love" when it opened in London in 1989. It was said that she was the first American cast in a lead role in an original production of a Lloyd Webber musical. She reprised the role in the Broadway production, which opened the next year.
The musical's story, a three-generational European saga, focused on a French actress, Rose Vibert, and her sexual attraction to her husband, her husband's young nephew and her husband's mistress.
It was Ms Crumb's most visible role, but not her most lauded.
Her most honored Broadway appearance was the title role in a 1992 musical adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina." Although Mel Gussow of The New York Times found Ms. Crumb too strident for the character, who throws away her reputation for the sake of a grand passion, Tony Awards insiders disagreed and nominated Ms. Crumb for best lead actress in a musical.
Elizabeth Ann Crumb was born in Charleston, W.Va., on May 25, 1950, the daughter of the composer George Crumb, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for music in 1968, and Elizabeth May (Brown) Crumb, a violinist.
Ann studied violin and hoped for a concert career, but that plan was derailed when, in her teens, she injured her right arm in a fall from a horse. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in music and theater at the University of Michigan but began a career in clinical medicine instead, doing some acting and singing on the side.
While working as a clinician in Philadelphia, she appeared to have a change of heart and was soon off on the national tour of "El Grande de Coca-Cola," a musical farce about a Mexican cabaret.
Ms. Crumb was about to turn 37 when she made her Broadway debut, in the original cast of "Les Misérables" (1987). She was an ensemble member whose characters were listed in Playbill as Factory Girl/Whore/Other Drinker/Young Prostitute. In 1988 she joined the ensemble of "Chess."
In the London production of "Aspects of Love," an onstage accident on a moving walkway severely damaged her foot. Doctors questioned whether she would walk again. She did, but despite numerous operations and specially designed shoes for the New York run, the injury caused her pain the rest of her life.
After "Anna Karenina," her last Broadway appearance, Ms. Crumb pursued her theater career outside New York. In 1992 she starred with Jonathan Pryce and Elaine Page in a concert performance of "Nine," recording a double CD at the Royal Concert Hall in London. She starred in London in a musical version of the movie "The Goodbye Girl." She headlined a concert tour devoted to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. And she starred opposite John Cullum in the 1995 national tour of "Man of La Mancha."
In 2010 she played Norma Desmond, the former silent screen star sinking into madness, in "Sunset Boulevard" at the Arvada Center near Denver; it was one of the first regional productions of that Lloyd Webber show. Back in Philadelphia, Ms. Crumb appeared in the Polly Pen musical "Bed and Sofa" (1999), played Maria Callas in Terrence McNally's "Master Class" (2010) and portrayed the sardonic aunt in Jon Robin Baitz's "Other Desert Cities" (2014).
She is survived by her parents and two brothers, David Crumb, a composer, and Peter Crumb.
An animal activist, Ms. Crumb was a founder of the Rescue Express, a nonprofit organization that transports and helps find foster homes for dogs and cats.
"I've always had a special love for dogs," she said in a 2010 interview. "I think I was a dachshund in a past life."

‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ QUESTIONS TURN TO JOBS: Democratic presidential candidates faced questions this weekend about what would happen to the jobs of people who work in the health insurance industry, just shortly after Elizabeth Warren put out a funding plan for “Medicare for all.”
It was an unexpected line of questioning. The industry itself isn’t terribly popular with the public. That’s one of the reasons why candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders aren’t afraid to go after them on a regular basis when they advocate for “Medicare for all,” while at the same time avoiding talk about taking on high costs in the hospital and drug industries, which people view more favorably even though their costs to the system are significantly higher than those of insurers or even drug companies. All of those industries, too, would face tremendous disruption under “Medicare for all.”
Warren had already acknowledged her plan would eliminate 2 million jobs in health insurance, both among people who work directly in the industry and among administrators in hospitals who negotiate with insurers about price. This weekend, she said those laid off workers could switch over to the auto and life insurance industries.
But Sanders had a different answer, saying those people would transition into providing healthcare, and that if elected he would “do everything we can” to provide training and support. He noted that more generous coverage that left no one uninsured would create a shortage of healthcare workers, so there would actually be a need for more jobs on net.
“We will transition those workers from sitting behind a desk arguing with you about whether or not you’re entitled to the coverage you thought you were into a more productive area of providing real healthcare,” Sanders said.
Cory Booker, who supports the Medicare for All Act but also has promised to sign any bill into law that moves in that direction, called job losses “fearmongering,” though he appeared to misunderstand that the question focused specifically on the private health insurance industry, which would be abolished under the bill. Colorado’s Michael Bennet, who supports a public option and has been critical of “Medicare for all,” said he wasn’t worried about what would happen to the health insurance industry. “We’re trying to get to universal healthcare as fast as we can,” he said.

COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM FORCING IMMIGRANTS TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE: Federal Judge Michael Simon of the Federal District Court in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out a policy that will require immigrants to show they can get health insurance before getting a visa.
OBAMACARE OPEN ENROLLMENT OFF TO A ROCKY START: On the first day of open enrollment for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, widespread technical glitches on HealthCare.gov made signing up for insurance difficult and even impossible in many cases, according to the Associated Press. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they were aware that people were having issues signing up and receiving error messages on the site, and promised its highest priority is to remedy the problem. Americans have until Dec. 15 to enroll in a plan through the site.
PELOSI NOT A ‘BIG FAN’ OF ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: Speaker Nancy Pelosi tamped down expectations for ‘Medicare for all’ Friday, the same day that Warren released her funding plan for the government-financed healthcare system. "I'm not a big fan of 'Medicare for all,’” Pelosi told Bloomberg Friday.
"But it is expensive. Who pays is very important. What are the benefits that come in there?” she asked. “I would think that, hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be more 'healthcare for all Americans.'"
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVERSES OBAMA-ERA ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS: Organizations that receive at least $500 billion in grants from Health and Human Services, including those that provide healthcare services and foster care, will no longer be required to show they won’t discriminate against gay or transgender people, as they were under Obama administration rules published in 2016. Gay and transgender-rights groups were quick to respond. Lambda Legal tweeted: "This rule will openly encourage discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, AND religion in *all* HHS programs. This is taxpayer-funded discrimination. Religion is NOT a #LicenseToDiscriminate.”
Religious organizations, like the Catholic Association Foundation, applauded the decision having fought for years against the Obama policy, which they said violated freedom of speech and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. "The proposed HHS rule frees faith-based adoption and foster care groups participating in programs that receive federal grants from the prior administration’s demand they include sexual orientation as a protected trait under anti-discrimination protections," said Andrea Picciotti-Bayer, a legal adviser for the foundation.
TRUMP NOMINATES CANCER SPECIALIST TO HEAD THE FDA: Dr. Stephen Hahn, chief medical executive at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was tapped for the top position at the Food and Drug Administration Friday. If confirmed, he will replace fellow oncologist Dr. Ned Sharpless. While Hahn doesn’t have experience running a government agency, he’ll have to hit the ground running as the FDA is currently entangled in debates about banning e-cigarette flavors and methods of remedying the opioid crisis.
Trump’s nomination came just under the wire. His deadline was Friday, because the Federal Vacancies Reform Act bars people from serving in an "acting" capacity for more than 210 days — in this case, Sharpless. Hahn will face the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for questioning, followed by the full Senate for a vote.

Nicholas Kristof: Will Great Britain become Little England?

Texto completo: London • Over the centuries, Great Britain spawned the Industrial Revolution and nurtured representative democracy. It ruled the waves and created common law. It nurtured the first anti-slavery movement and stood up to Hitler.
And now Britain has gone nuts.
To paraphrase Churchill, if the nation should last for 1,000 years, people may look back and say: This was their saddest hour. Actually, never mind: Brexit may cause the United Kingdom to fragment, so that the country might not last a decade more, let alone last a millennium.
The U.K. is headed for a new election on Dec. 12, at a time when both its major parties are headed by people who should never be trusted anywhere near Downing Street. What’s more serious is the likelihood that Prime Minister Boris Johnson may eventually manage to drag a wearied Britain out of the European Union.
It’s baffling for friends of Britain to see Johnson leading in the polls as he recklessly pursues a path that is damaging his country economically and risks dismembering it. Those of us sentimental about the U.K. — Shakespeare! Cream tea! The Beatles! The Famous Five! — feel as if we’re watching a dear friend quaff a few pints of bitter and hurtle toward a cliff.
Economists largely agree that Brexit will cause both trade and GDP to suffer. One study estimates that Britain may already be 3% poorer simply because of planning for Brexit. Another puts the long-term decline at 3.5%; a different one estimates a 6% drop in the medium term. As The Economist magazine noted, Johnson’s Brexit plan would be even worse for the U.K. economy than that of his predecessor, Theresa May.
Johnson’s Brexit would leave Northern Ireland more integrated with Ireland than with the rest of Britain. And as religion becomes less important on both sides of the border, pressure for Irish unification will grow. One recent poll found a small majority in Northern Ireland in favor of leaving the U.K. and merging with Ireland — although the brakes may come from an Ireland wary of inheriting the weaker Northern Ireland economy.
“Paradoxically, Mr. Johnson and Brexit may have done more for a United Ireland than the IRA ever did,” Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair, wrote in The Financial Times. Powell warned that Johnson’s plan may “mark the end of the union, leaving a Little Englander government ruling a Little England.”
In Scotland as well, a poll shows a plurality now in favor of independence, and there are already calls for a new referendum on independence.
“The best future for Scotland is one as an equal, independent European nation,” said Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. “That is a choice I’m determined to ensure is given to the people of Scotland.”
Pragmatism may restrain Scots in the end, for Scotland presumably would then be out of the EU and would find itself creating a border with England as well. It’s far from clear that the EU would welcome Scotland back, for fear of encouraging separatists in places like Catalonia.
Even Wales seems fed up. One survey found that 41% of people in Wales would favor separation if they could remain in the EU.
A fractured Great Britain would no longer be great; ultimately, all that would be left might be England. A mighty union that had lasted hundreds of years, running from the Orkneys to Cornwall, from Belfast to Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, would have been torn asunder by the demagoguery of politicians like Johnson who can’t manage even their personal lives, let alone a nation.
London is a tribute to the great man theory of history, with statues and street names and monuments underscoring how leaders change history. Yes, they do — and if the U.K. fragments and Britain’s economy continues to decline, it will be because of the foolhardy and mendacious campaign by Johnson and his enablers. He would be remembered perhaps as the 21st-century version of Guy Fawkes.
This election reflects sordid calculations all around: Johnson hoping that he can win a majority, the Scottish National Party wanting the balloting over before it is discredited by a sexual assault trial next year involving its former leader. If no party wins a majority, it’s possible that we’ll be back where we started, or that Labour will cobble together a government with the Liberal Democrats and hold another referendum on Brexit. I hope so.
One of my British ancestors was Ralph the Wrecker, a pirate from Hunmanby in Yorkshire who set lights on the coast to fool ships so that they would crash on the rocks. He was finally arrested and sentenced to hang. As he stood on the gallows, the noose ready, a messenger galloped up with a pardon. Otherwise I might not be here.
So I know that the British are capable of a change of heart — and we friends of England are hoping for another so that Britain can remain Great.

SS. Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic Church donated truckloads of goods to two local nonprofit organizations.
Following its annual rummage sale in September and a follow-up sale last month, the church filled four pickup beds and two cars with boxes last week, delivering them to United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania, said Lauren Telep, chairwoman of the rummage sales.
The church also filled a truck bed with boxes, delivering it to Catholic Social Services, she said.
“We would rather pay it forward,” she said.
This was the fifth year they donated to UNC and the second year they donated items to CSS, Telep said, explaining the church asks its congregation to suggest nonprofit organizations that need help.
Items included Christmas decorations, dishes, glasses, sheets, towels, lamps, suitcases, backpacks, tote bags and small figurines, she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's approval rating may be underwater, and about half of the country may want him impeached, but he still has shot to win in the half-dozen battleground states that could secure his reelection next year, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College.
The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters.
'I have the real polls': Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment
USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field
The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan.
Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election.
The Times said the results of the poll "suggest that the president’s advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole remains intact or has even grown since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could – for the third time in the past six elections – win the presidency while losing the popular vote. "
And The Times said the results showed "little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016. "
Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42% – his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018 – and his disapproval at 57%.
And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%. Forty-nine percent of registered voters said they thought he should be impeached and convicted in the Senate in Sunday's Fox News poll.

Texto completo: Here are six potentially armchair-worthy new paperback releases.
“Blowing the Bloody Doors Off” by Michael Caine (Hachette, $16.99): Sir Michael is among the most charming of men — which I can say with some authority, because I interviewed him on the phone once and nearly passed out from the delightfulness of it all. This memoir/how-to book for actors, filled with anecdotes from his career, is like that phone conversation in book length; reading it, as I did last year, feels like a down-to-earth, kindhearted ramble from your
nice British great-uncle, who has led a fascinating and glamorous life but never forgot his humble roots.
“Little” by Edward Carey (Penguin Random House, $17): Set in 1760s Paris, this novel tells of the adventures of a tiny orphan named Marie, who has a remarkable gift for sculpting wax — and whose destiny, against the backdrop of the French Revolution, is to become the famous Madame Tussaud. A review in The Guardian called it “a visceral, vivid and moving novel about finding and honoring one’s talent; about searching out where one belongs and who one loves, however strange and politically fraught the result might be.”
“The Infinite Blacktop” by Sara Gran (Washington Square Press, $16.99): The third in Gran’s series of mysteries featuring private detective Claire DeWitt, “The Infinite Blacktop” combines three intertwining stories: Claire’s present in Oakland and Las Vegas, in which someone seems to be trying to kill her; her early years as a young detective in Brooklyn, when her best friend disappeared; and her first Los Angeles case, involving an artist’s unexplained death. The author “has an engagingly sardonic voice and a sure grip of storytelling basics,” wrote a New York Times reviewer, praising the book as a “completely original hybrid of mystery, thriller, contemporary noir, dark comedy and postmodern meditation about what it means to be a detective.”
“Killing Commendatore” by Haruki Murakami (Vintage, $17): Murakami, the acclaimed Japanese author whose works have been translated into more than 50 languages, has said that this novel is his homage to his favorite book, “The Great Gatsby.” A New York Times critic wrote that the book “is hard to describe — it is so expansive and intricate — but it touches on many of the themes familiar in Mr. Murakami’s novels: the mystery of romantic love, the weight of history, the transcendence of art, the search for elusive things just outside our grasp.”
“An Orchestra of Minorities” by Chigozie Obioma (Little, Brown, $16.99): Obioma’s second novel (his first, “The Fisherman,” was a finalist for the Booker Prize) recounts the life story of a modest chicken farmer in southeastern Nigeria, told from the point of view of his guardian spirit. Seattle Times reviewer David Takami called it “a rare treasure: a book that deepens the mystery of the human experience” and noted that its “acknowledgment of life’s mystery — and a willingness to embrace it — makes ‘An Orchestra of Minorities’ a transcendent read.”
“Family Trust” by Kathy Wang (HarperCollins, $16.99): Wang’s debut is a whirling family saga featuring the Huangs: a dying patriarch, his ex-wife and his two adult children, all of whom live and work in California’s Silicon Valley. An NPR critic called it “addictive” and “captivating,” describing it as “a story about families and what connects everyone to one another, about the ties that bind and the comfort that financial security can bring to people inside the hamster wheel of American consumerism.”

BUTTIGIEG PANS WARREN 'MATH' FOR MEDICAID

Texto completo: Surging presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg criticized Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's $20 trillion plus plan to fund "Medicare for All."
Warren on Friday said she would find a way to fund Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance plan that would eliminate private insurance without raising taxes on the middle class. Warren said her proposal relies on cuts to government spending and steep taxes for the wealthy, among other measures.
How to reform the nation's health care system - and how achievable the reforms are - have emerged as a top issue in the Democratic primary.
Buttigieg told "This Week" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, "the math is certainly controversial."
"What is just not true is that hers is the only solution," he said of Warren. "This my way or the highway idea, that either you're for kicking everybody off their private plans in four years or you're for business as usual."
He said he's "proposing Medicare for all who want it."
"Not everyone wants to go" off their private plans, Buttigieg said.
He said he does not support kicking Americans off their private plans and said his plan would be funded in 10 years through rolling back corporate tax rate cuts and allowing Medicare to negotiate rates.
Buttigieg said Medicare for All "could very well be the long-run destination, but I think there's got to be some humility in our policy here. Let's put this out there and see if it's really the best plan for everybody."
"If it's the right plan," he continued "then everybody will move to it until it is the single payer. And if it's not the right plan for everybody, then we're going to be really glad we didn't kick some Americans off their private plans."
Buttigieg's poll numbers have been rising nationally and among likely Iowa caucus goers.
Buttigieg overtook former Vice President Joseph Biden in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, garnering 18% of support behind Sanders, with 19, and Warren, with 22%.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday showed Biden in first place in national polling, with 28% support. He was followed by Warren, with 23%, and Sanders, with 17%. Buttigieg, with 9%, was in fourth place, showing a five-point jump since September.
Buttigieg appeared to say on Showtime's "The Circus" that he sees a possibility in which the race could narrow down to just him and Warren - "it's coming down to the two of us."
Buttigieg said, "Not yet, no. Look, there is a - a tremendous amount of energy for a range of candidates who are extremely capable." Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' "Face The Nation" that it is "naive for him to think that at this point, that the fate of this election has been determined. Just look at history." 
Harris, who let go of most of her New Hampshire staff last week, said she was "all in" in Iowa. Harris said in an interview Saturday that she had not read the details of Warren's plan, but said, "I'm not taking choice from people."

Life &amp; Arts: The Fires, Seen Through Their Lenses --- The photographers who risk their lives to document California's disaster

Texto completo: Geyserville, Calif. -- For 12 hours the night the Kincade fire started, photographer Noah Berger kept his Nissan Xterra running. In the fire zone, Mr. Berger never turns it off. There might not be enough oxygen to start it again.
Mr. Berger drove through blood-orange smoke banks and flame-lined country roads in Northern California wine country, snapping photos for the Associated Press. In the back seat, cameras sat on a packed fire shelter -- essentially an aluminum foil coffin the freelancer could climb into as a last resort attempt to survive a burn over.
Stories like this come standard for this group of shooters who deliver the most dramatic shots of California's escalating wildfires. They race to the far corners of the state from June to November to capture the first -- and often most consequential -- hours of a fire.
"I got hooked on the experience of being out here," Mr. Berger says. "It strips off the mundane layers of life."
When multiple fires break out around the state, they skip from one to the next. Their photos appear in the world's largest newspapers and magazines and have won top photography awards.
In reality, the craft requires Mr. Berger and other freelancers to slog through months of monotonous but better-paying work for corporate clients. (Their day rates for the news assignments are often between $250 and $600.) It also strains family life at home. Much of those months off, Mr. Berger says, are spent anticipating the next season.
Mr. Berger already had a sense of what was ahead back in May. "It's coming; I felt a dry leaf crinkle under my foot this morning when walking the dog," he said then.
Five months later, northerly winds whipped across the ridges above Sonoma County's Alexander Valley the night the Kincade fire broke out. Winds have fanned the fire into one of the state's most destructive blazes of the season.
With bags already packed, Mr. Berger left his home in Alameda, an island in San Francisco Bay, within 20 minutes of receiving an alert on his phone about a new fire.
By midnight, Mr. Berger drove up a winding rural road in wine country mountains. He met up with usual fire-shooting partners, Josh Edelson, a freelancer for Agence France-Presse, and Justin Sullivan, a staff photographer with Getty Images.
The fire gained steam. A scanner picking up radio chatter between nearby firefighters crackled: houses on fire down the mountain. The crew, with this reporter following, began a perilous drive around curves obscured by smoke while flaming stumps framed the road. Heat from flames could be felt inside the car. Fire burst out of a manhole.
Mr. Berger jumped out to photograph the first moments a home with a bench press in the yard caught fire. He retreated when the home's propane tank shot ignited gas into the air like a blow torch.
He ran down the street and snapped photos of a burning house, an image that would run on the front page of The Wall Street Journal a day later.
"You push deeper [into the fire zone] and realize it's not as dangerous as you thought. So you push further and further," Mr. Berger said about his evolution into high-stakes fire photography.
As the sun rose over Sonoma County, Mr. Berger jogged through rows of grapevines. From behind a trellis, he photographed a sprawling estate burning to the ground. Tall flames rained ash into a swimming pool and a bocce court smoldered.
In the six years Mr. Berger has shot wildfires, he has become a recognizable figure at wildfires and known affectionately to some as Big Man. At 6-foot-6, he sports a custom-made, extra-long yellow fire jacket. Two cameras dangle from his shoulders. He smokes cigarettes almost nonstop at fires.
This year, Mr. Berger and two other photographers were Pulitzer Prize finalists for breaking news photography. Their photos of the 2018 fire season included a shot by Mr. Berger of five men carrying a body bag through haze in the destroyed town of Paradise.
Mr. Berger, 45, has a way of maintaining a sense of humor even when witnessing something awful. In an evacuated neighborhood near the Kincade fire, a firefighter wheeled trash bins to the curb to clear a path for a hose crew.
"Big Man!" the firefighter said when he saw Mr. Berger standing on the lawn.
"You taking out the trash?" Mr. Berger bantered.
"Like a normal day, man," the firefighter said before rushing off.
As news coverage of wildfires intensifies and more news crews flock to fire zones, Mr. Berger sometimes winces at the spectacle he acknowledges he's a part of.
"It feels a little more icky than it did a few years ago, like it's an attraction now," Mr. Berger said. Most of all, he worries that rookie photojournalists and television news crews covering this story don't get the importance of staying out of firefighters' way.
At the Kincade fire, the morning weather calmed the blaze and Mr. Berger and his colleagues regrouped along a country road. Stephen Lam, there on assignment for Thomson Reuters and a regular in Mr. Berger's crew, showed up after hours of radio silence, which had been worrying Mr. Berger.
Mr. Edelson, the AFP photographer, agonized about having to leave to shoot executive headshots for San Francisco software company Salesforce.com.
"I emailed the client and said 'I'm literally surrounded by fire,' " Mr. Edelson said. He estimates corporate work pays 10 times what working a fire does. "I only do that work so I can be out here."
Mr. Edelson's photos from the night ran in the Journal, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
Obsessively chasing wildfires for six months each year has become a point of contention back at home for Messrs. Berger and Edelson. The Kincade fire's flare-up on Oct. 27 came the day before Mr. Edelson's wedding anniversary. Torn between the fire and a trip to Santa Catalina Island with his wife, Mr. Edelson pulled an all nighter in the fire zone before flying to Southern California to board a boat the same day.
Mr. Berger worries his lifestyle is contributing to his 9-year-old son's anxiety issues.
Still, the shooters' passion for the craft is only deepening. To improve, they study others' bodies of work. For instance, Santa Rosa Press Democrat staffer Kent Porter's expertise in reading weather and topography puts him in perfect locations, Mr. Berger says.
Stuart Palley is a Newport Beach, Calif.-based photographer and buddy of Mr. Berger's who has also covered this story. (His work has also been used by the Journal.)
"There's an element of time being suspended. I feel in the moment," Mr. Palley said at the Saddleridge fire near Los Angeles in early October.
Mr. Berger spent about a week at the Kincade fire -- eating, sleeping, editing photos and socializing with other photographers, all from his car.
When new fires erupted near L.A., Mr. Berger drove across the state to them. Mr. Edelson and his wife cut their anniversary trip short and he joined Mr. Berger.
But soon, when the rains return and firefighters contain the last of the state's fires, the men will call fire season quits. That's sometimes the hard part. "You come back and hear people talking about their prosaic lives," Mr. Berger says. "But your mind is still out there."

DES MOINES, Iowa—Joe Biden is facing a narrower path to win the first presidential-nominating contest, as a strengthening Pete Buttigieg threatens to cut into his support among centrist Democrats while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders solidify their hold on the party's left wing.
A weekend of events in Iowa, capped by a raucous party fundraising dinner before 13,000 activists, offered evidence of a scrambled race for the 2020 nomination. Recent surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, the second state in the nominating process, show the former vice president slipping even as he holds a lead in national polls.
More From the Late October Poll
* Impeachment Increasingly Divides Americans by Political Party
* Poll results
Three months before the start of voting, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed Mr. Biden with 27% support among Democratic primary voters nationally, followed by Ms. Warren at 23%, Mr. Sanders at 19% and Mr. Buttigieg at 6%.
But the picture looks different in the state with the first contest, which at times has been an outlier but where the results can serve as a burst of momentum for a candidate at the start of voting. During a four-day swing across Iowa, Mr. Biden said he was the candidate best-positioned to challenge President Trump next November. He made his appeal before crowds numbering in the hundreds and meeting in intimate venues, a contrast to the larger rallies held by Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg.
During Friday night's Liberty and Justice Celebration , a section of seats near the top of the arena that had been assigned to Mr. Biden's campaign was largely vacant.
A spokesman for Mr. Biden said some of the campaign's supporters were unable to use their tickets and were spread around the arena. The campaign estimated it had 1,200 ticketed supporters at the venue, comparable to other campaigns.
Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has seen growing crowds at his events and rising support in polls that has coincided with Mr. Biden's struggles. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed Ms. Warren at 22% in the state, Mr. Sanders at 19%, Mr. Buttigieg at 18% and Mr. Biden at 17%. Many polls earlier in the fall and summer that showed Mr. Biden leading in Iowa had Mr. Buttigieg in the single digits or low teens.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How important is Iowa to Joe Biden's path to the Democratic presidential nomination? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Buttigieg, traveling with reporters aboard his campaign bus, said Sunday, "we all know that it's a fluid race, that it's a competitive race and that anything can happen."
Mr. Biden, in a brief interview, described the race as a "dog fight" and said he would not "take anything for granted. I've got to work like hell out here."
The Biden team is playing down his prospects in Iowa, noting that his broad support among black voters in particular will help him in places like South Carolina, which votes at the end of February.
"I think we're the only ones who don't have to win Iowa, honestly, because our strength is the fact that we have a broad and diverse coalition," said Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager.
Mr. Schultz said the Iowa caucuses could "have three or four or five candidates all within a couple of percentage points. Does anybody win? Technically, yes, maybe. But does that give you clarity on where the heart of the Democratic Party is? I would say, 'no.' "
Mr. Biden's team released new advertising in Iowa as part of a $4 million buy that will air through the Feb. 3 caucuses. They also noted that Mr. Biden raised $5.3 million online in October, his best month to date, after Mr. Trump tore into the former vice president over his son's overseas work in Ukraine, which has led to the Trump impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Biden's team also said he could pick up support among voters who don't view him as their first choice in Iowa, given the 15% threshold needed to qualify for delegates in individual caucus meetings. National polling, however, suggests Ms. Warren might benefit should other candidates not meet the threshold: In the new Journal/NBC News poll, 24% of voters named her when asked their second choice, while 15% backed Mr. Biden and 14% favored Mr. Sanders.
Meanwhile, Mr. Biden is being pressed from the left, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, senators from Massachusetts and Vermont, respectively, questioning his progressive bona fides.
When Ms. Warren last week released her plan for covering the $20.5 trillion cost of her Medicare for All proposal, Mr. Biden pointed to the nearly $9 trillion in taxes to be placed on U.S. employers over a decade—in line with health premiums they would no longer pay.
Ms. Warren, in turn, suggested that Mr. Biden was defending high profits for insurance and pharmaceutical companies and was "running in the wrong presidential primary." That prompted Mr. Biden to respond in a fundraising email that he had been "a card-carrying Democrat since I was 27." (Ms. Warren was a registered Republican in the 1990s).
Mr. Biden's team views Medicare for All as a liability in Iowa.
"The plan put forward by Bernie and Elizabeth, even out here, is not embraced by a majority of the people," Mr. Biden said in the Journal interview. "And so I think what people are going to start to focus on, at least I hope, is a little bit of, sort of, truth in advertising."
That approach resonated with Susan Reighard, a substitute teacher from DeWitt, Iowa, who signed a pledge card for Mr. Biden after initially considering Ms. Warren.
"I like that his health-care plan isn't restarting everything from square one. I like that his plan is doable," she said.
Mr. Sanders has seized upon the recent decision by supporters of Mr. Biden to form a super PAC to push back against millions of dollars in anti-Biden advertising by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Biden, who had said he would oppose the formation of any outside groups that back his candidacy, has said he has no control over outside expenditures. Another could come from the International Association of Fire Fighters, which is planning an independent expenditure soon on Mr. Biden's behalf.
Tom Avenarius, a United Auto Workers retiree who surveyed some of the 2020 candidates at an event in Cedar Rapids, said he was leaning toward Mr. Biden but that the former vice president hadn't been "forceful enough."
Mr. Avenarius, who is active with the Iowa Democratic Veterans' Caucus, said he was interested in the 37-year-old Mr. Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy Reserves.
"I think that's what this country is looking for, which is a young president just to change some ideas and rattle some cages," Mr. Avenarius said.

Texto completo: In the Oval Office, an annoyed President Trump ended an argument he was having with his aides. He reached into a drawer, took out his iPhone and threw it on top of the historic Resolute Desk:
"Do you want me to settle this right now?"
There was no missing Mr. Trump's threat that day in early 2017, the aides recalled. With a tweet, he could fling a directive to the world, and there was nothing they could do about it.
When Mr. Trump entered office, Twitter was a political tool that had helped get him elected and a digital howitzer that he relished firing. In the years since, he has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration, reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power.
After Turkey invaded northern Syria this past month, he crafted his response not only in White House meetings but also in a series of contradictory tweets. This summer, he announced increased tariffs on $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods, using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries. And in March, Mr. Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy, tweeting his recognition of Israel's sovereignty in the Golan Heights. He openly delighted in the reaction he provoked.
"Boom. I press it," Mr. Trump recalled months later at a White House conference attended by conservative social media personalities, "and, within two seconds, 'We have breaking news."'
Early on, top aides wanted to restrain the president's Twitter habit, even considering asking the company to impose a 15-minute delay on Mr. Trump's messages. But 11,390 presidential tweets later, many administration officials and lawmakers embrace his Twitter obsession, flocking to his social media chief with suggestions. Policy meetings are hijacked when Mr. Trump gets an idea for a tweet, drawing in cabinet members and others for wordsmithing. And as a president often at war with his own bureaucracy, he deploys Twitter to break through logjams, overrule or humiliate recalcitrant advisers and pre-empt his staff.
"He needs to tweet like we need to eat," Kellyanne Conway, his White House counselor, said in an interview.
In a presidency unlike any other, where Mr. Trump wakes to Twitter, goes to bed with it and is comforted by how much it revolves around him, the person he most often singled out for praise was himself -- more than 2,000 times, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
The Times examined Mr. Trump's use of Twitter since taking office, reviewing all his tweets, retweets and followers, and interviewing nearly 50 current and former administration officials, lawmakers and Twitter executives and employees. What has emerged is a rich account, with new analysis, previously unreported episodes and fresh details of how the president exploits the platform to exert power.
It is often by brute repetition. He has taken to Twitter to demand action 1,159 times on immigration and his border wall, a top priority, and 521 times on tariffs, another key agenda item. Twitter is an instrument of his foreign policy: He has praised dictators more than a hundred times, while complaining nearly twice as much about America's traditional allies. Twitter is the Trump administration's de facto personnel office: The chief executive has announced the departures of more than two dozen top officials, some fired by tweet.
More than half of the president's posts -- 5,889 -- have been attacks; no other category even comes close. His targets include the Russia investigation, a Federal Reserve that won't bow to his whims, previous administrations, entire cities that are led by Democrats, and adversaries from outspoken athletes to chief executives who displease him. Like no other modern president, Mr. Trump has publicly harangued businesses to advance his political goals and silence criticism, often with talk of government intervention. Using Twitter, he threatened "Saturday Night Live" with an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and accused Amazon, led by Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, of cheating the United States Postal Service.
As much as anything, Twitter is the broadcast network for Mr. Trump's parallel political reality -- the "alternative facts" he has used to spread conspiracy theories, fake information and extremist content, including material that energizes some of his base.
Mr. Trump's use of Twitter has accelerated sharply since the end of the special counsel's Russia investigation and reached a new high as Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry, the analysis shows. He tweeted more than 500 times during the first two weeks of October, a pace that put him on track to triple his monthly average. (The Times analyzed Mr. Trump's tweets through Oct. 15. The total by the end of the month reached 11,887.)
His more than 66 million Twitter followers have become his private polling service, offering what he sees as validation for his performance in office. But fewer than one-fifth of his followers are voting-age Americans, according to a Times analysis of Pew Research national surveys of adults who use Twitter.
The White House press office declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. Now, as Mr. Trump anticipates a bitter re-election battle and faces an impeachment inquiry by Democrats, the stakes are higher than ever before, and Twitter even more central to his presidency.
His top campaign aides are embracing the outrage that Mr. Trump stirs with his tweets to reinforce his anti-establishment brand and strengthen his bond with the fiercely loyal supporters who propelled him into office. And as public backing for impeachment grows, the president is using the platform to build a defensive echo chamber.
While people around Mr. Trump acknowledge that his tweets can cause political damage, the president is confident in his mastery of Twitter.
This past week, as he announced that American Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, Mr. Trump noted the terror group's digital prowess. "They use the internet better than almost anybody in the world," he said. "Perhaps other than Donald Trump."
Policy via Twitter
With a single tweet last fall, Mr. Trump sent his administration into a tailspin. "I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught," he wrote in October 2018, angry about a caravan of migrants from Central America. "If unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"
Mr. Trump's aides had tried for weeks to talk him out of shutting down the border -- the logistics would be impossible and the economic pain extreme. The tweet prompted an emergency meeting down the hall from the Oval Office as aides scrambled to head off Mr. Trump's impulse, according to people familiar with the frantic scene. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the president.
The aides succeeded in temporarily holding him off, but the tweet crystallized for cautious bureaucrats exactly what he wanted: to stop people from coming into the country. In the months that followed, Mr. Trump's threat helped to set off an effort inside the government to find ever more restrictive ways to block immigrants. Nearly six months later, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was still trying to prevent a border shutdown when the president brought her resistance to an end.
"Kirstjen Nielsen," he tweeted, "will be leaving her position."
This is governing in the Trump era. For President Barack Obama, a tweet about a presidential proposal might mark the conclusion of a long, deliberative process. For Mr. Trump, Twitter is often the beginning of how policy is made.
"Suddenly there's a tweet, and everything gets upended and you spent the week trying to defend something else," said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. "This person thrives on chaos. What we may find disconcerting or upsetting or whatever, it is actually what keeps him going."
In October 2017, Rex W. Tillerson, the president's first secretary of state, was in China with a team of diplomats negotiating sanctions on Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, when Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter. Mr. Tillerson was "wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man," he wrote. "Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"
Two months later, a Reuters headline blared that Mick Mulvaney, who then was Mr. Trump's new pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had decided to put "on ice" sanctions against Wells Fargo for consumer abuses. It was little surprise: Mr. Mulvaney was an ally of the financial industry. But Mr. Trump had other ideas.
"Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased," he tweeted.
Political appointees at the bureau wanted to affirm Mr. Trump's desire publicly, despite longstanding policies against commenting on active investigations, according to former officials there. A spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney issued a statement saying only that he "shares the president's firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers."
According to two people with direct knowledge of the Wells Fargo inquiry, career bureau officials took Mr. Trump's outburst as a green light to pursue aggressive negotiations with the bank, even as Mr. Mulvaney's team prepared to dial back penalties in other cases or shelve them. Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to a billion-dollar federal settlement, the bureau's largest-ever civil penalty.
Over time, Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a means of presidential communication as vital as a statement from the White House press secretary or an Oval Office address. The press secretary has not held a daily on-camera press briefing -- a decades-long ritual of presidential messaging -- since March. Instead, Mr. Trump's Twitter activity drives the day.
And Mr. Trump has removed any doubt that his tweets carry the weight once reserved for more formal pronouncements.
In summer 2018, his aides repeatedly tried to reassure Republican lawmakers that the president backed their hard-line immigration bill, despite his remarks suggesting otherwise. But privately, Mr. Trump told several senators that there was only one certain sign of his support.
"If I don't tweet it," he said, according to two former senior advisers, "don't listen to my staff."
Adapting a Platform
When Mr. Trump entered office, aides were determined to rein in his itchy Twitter fingers.
In a series of informal conversations in early 2017, top White House officials discussed the possibility of a 15-minute delay on the president's account, a technical change not unlike the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks. But, one former senior official said, they quickly abandoned the idea after recognizing the political peril if it leaked to the press -- or to their boss.
Several weeks later, a trio of close advisers presented Mr. Trump with another idea. Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser; Hope Hicks, the president's director of strategic communications; and Rob Porter, his staff secretary, argued that they should see the tweets before he sent them out.
Mr. Trump was skeptical, worrying that delayed tweets would be irrelevant, according to a former White House official. But he agreed to a weeklong trial. Within 72 hours, the president had resumed tweeting from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.
Three thousand miles away, in Silicon Valley, similar conversations were unfolding at Twitter's offices, where executives faced the same dilemma as Mr. Trump's inner circle: whether, and how, to restrain him.
At the time, Twitter lagged far behind larger competitors like Facebook. While popular among politicians and journalists, it was struggling financially. But the president's incessant tweeting gave the company more currency.
His Twitter account often drove more "impressions" -- a key company metric -- than any other in the world. But some of his messages seemed to violate the company's policies against abuse and incitement.
On a now-defunct internal company message board known as Twitter Buzz, some left-leaning employees favored barring the president. Mr. Trump's behavior came up at almost every all-hands gathering and at many smaller meetings of executives. Some of them had set their phones to alert them whenever the president tweeted, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of confidentiality.
"What I saw was a company coming to grips with an entirely new situation, a new level of scrutiny, a new level of vitriol," said Dianna Colasurdo, a former account executive on Twitter's political advertising sales team, "and working to adapt their policies in the moment to align with that."
A turning point came in fall 2017, at the height of tensions with North Korea, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the rogue nation might not "be around much longer!" The country's foreign minister called that a declaration of war. On Twitter, users wondered if the company would allow Mr. Trump to tweet his way into a nuclear conflict.
The response came the next day. Referring back to Mr. Trump's online declaration, Twitter announced in a tweet that it took "newsworthiness" into account when evaluating whether to remove a post that violated its policies.
In an interview, Twitter executives said that newsworthiness had long figured into the company's internal enforcement guidelines and that officials there had been formulating the announcement, which applied worldwide, months before Mr. Trump's North Korea tweet. But former employees said they understood the announcement to be Trump-driven. Twitter did not want to be in the business of censoring the president.
Late in summer 2018, White House insiders tried again to curb Mr. Trump's use of social media, according to two former aides. After a series of over-the-top weeks of tweeting -- including calling Omarosa Manigault Newman, his onetime aide, "wacky" and "a lowlife" -- several advisers suggested he go just two days without Twitter and see what happened. Mr. Trump nodded, and then promptly discarded the advice.
Mr. King, who said most of his Republican colleagues wished the president would tweet less, added that whenever he had raised the issue with White House staff members, they shrugged helplessly.
"It's not going to stop," he recalled their saying. "Forget it; we've all tried."
Soon enough, Mr. Trump was as prolific as ever.
On Sept. 13, he mocked Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, for claiming he could beat Mr. Trump in an election. "He doesn't have the aptitude or 'smarts' & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess," the president tweeted. Over the next 12 hours, Mr. Trump attacked two former F.B.I. officials, accused The Wall Street Journal of getting a tariff story wrong and blasted former Secretary of State John Kerry for holding "illegal meetings" with Iran.
"BAD!" he wrote.
First Things First
Mr. Trump's Twitter habit is most intense in the morning, when he is in the White House residence, watching Fox News, scrolling through his Twitter mentions and turning the social media platform into what one aide called the "ultimate weapon of mass dissemination."
Of the attack tweets identified in the Times analysis, nearly half were sent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., hours that Mr. Trump spends mostly without advisers present.
After waking early, Mr. Trump typically watches news shows recorded the previous night on his "Super TiVo," several DVRs connected to a single remote. (The devices are set to record "Lou Dobbs Tonight" on Fox Business Network; "Hannity," "Tucker Carlson Tonight" and "The Story With Martha MacCallum" on Fox News; and "Anderson Cooper 360" on CNN.)
He takes in those shows, and the "Fox & Friends" morning program, then flings out comments on his iPhone. Then he watches as his tweets reverberate on cable channels and news sites.
Early on Sept. 2 -- the start of a week in which he tweeted 198 times -- the president sent a few benign tweets, then lashed out at Paul Krugman as a "Failing New York Times columnist" who "never got it!" Over the next 44 minutes, he fired off 10 more tweets. He disparaged Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ("Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on.") He called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and his "dwindling group of friends" liars and traitors. He railed against The Washington Post and four women of color in Congress who called themselves "the Squad."
Almost every morning that week, Mr. Trump kicked off the day with an attack on one critic or another: the "incompetent Mayor of London," or "Bad 'actress' Debra The Mess Messing" -- whom he accused of being racist -- or the "Fake News Media." He referred to conservative media outlets 45 times, berated the mainstream media 32 times and tweeted about conspiracy theories 12 times.
Sometimes the president's apparent fury on Twitter is meant to troll his critics and get a rise out of them, many of his closest aides said. But they still brace themselves, knowing that they are likely to be blindsided by one of his tweets. Aides who gather for the early-morning staff meetings in the West Wing said their agenda was regularly blown up when their phones simultaneously went off with a tweet from the boss.
Once Mr. Trump arrives in the West Wing -- usually after 10 a.m. -- Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, takes control of the Twitter account, tweeting as @realDonaldTrump from his own phone or computer. Mr. Trump rarely tweets in front of others, those close to him say, because he does not like to wear the reading glasses he needs to see the screen.
Instead, the president dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino, who sits in a closet-size room just off the Oval Office until Mr. Trump calls out "Scavino!" Often, he prints out suggested tweets in extra-large fonts for the president to sign off on. (A single-page article that Mr. Scavino recently printed out for him ran to six pages after the fonts were enlarged, according to one person who saw it.)
Mr. Scavino's role in Mr. Trump's Twitter machine has made him an unlikely White House power broker and the go-to person for aides, business executives, friends and lawmakers who want the president to tweet something. Ms. Conway noted what she called the hypocrisy of many Republicans who begged her to get Mr. Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign and now come to Mr. Scavino with suggestions. Mr. Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.
He sometimes acts as a brake -- or tries to -- on the president's tweeting impulses. When Mr. Trump started angrily posting about the "Squad," Mr. Scavino told him it was a bad idea, according to an aide who witnessed the conversation. Along with Michael Dubke, who served as White House communications director for several months in 2017 and is from Buffalo, home of the famous chicken wings, Mr. Scavino presented some tweets to Mr. Trump in degrees of outrageousness: "hot," "medium" or "mild." Mr. Trump, said one former official who saw the proposed messages, always picked the most incendiary ones and often wanted to make them even more provocative.
And while many of Mr. Trump's tweets are shoot-from-the-hip attacks, he chews over others for days or even weeks, waiting for just the right moment to maximize the reaction, aides say.
He plotted for days to tweet about Mika Brzezinski, the liberal co-host of the popular MSNBC morning program, according to former White House officials, before finally posting one morning in June 2017. He called her "low I.Q. Crazy Mika" and wrote that she had been "bleeding badly from a face-lift" during a New Year's Eve party.
In October of last year, the president started telling his aides that he planned to denounce Stormy Daniels, a pornographic-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him more than a decade earlier. He said he wanted to call her a "horse face."
Several current and former aides recalled telling Mr. Trump that it was a terrible idea and would renew accusations of misogyny against him. But he persisted.
Finally, after watching a Fox News report days later about how a federal judge had thrown out a lawsuit by Ms. Daniels, the president tapped out the tweet.
"Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas," he wrote.
A Love of 'Likes'
For Mr. Trump, Twitter reinforces his instincts about his performance as president.
After a rally in Dallas in mid-October, Mr. Trump's aides prepared a large-type printout of tweets gushing over his speech that day, including one from Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator and the host of a show on the Fox Nation site. Mr. Trump scrawled a thank-you note on one copy to Ms. Lahren -- who then tweeted a picture of the letter back at the president.
Aides said they often compiled positive feedback for Mr. Trump. He revels in the stream of praise from his most loyal followers, on paper or as he scrolls through his phone early in the morning and late at night. He considers his following to be like the ratings on a TV show, better than any approval poll. After one weekend Twitter spree, the president told Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary at the time, he had expected a tweet he was particularly proud of to get more response than it did, according to a former administration official. Ms. Sanders said that if he tweeted 60 times, people wouldn't pay as much attention, the official said.
The president is keenly aware of his number of followers and reluctant to acknowledge that any of them are not real. Mr. Trump has accused Twitter of political bias for its periodic purges of bot accounts across the platform, which have cost him -- and other prominent users -- hundreds of thousands of followers. When he met with the company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in April, Mr. Trump reportedly pressed him at length about the lost followers.
There is plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump's Twitter following may not be a reliable proxy for what the American people think of the job he is doing.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine with certainty how many of Mr. Trump's more than 66 million followers are fake. Some studies of his followers have estimated that a high proportion are likely to be automated bots, fake accounts or inactive. But even a conservative analysis by The Times found that nearly a third of them, about 22 million, included no biographical information and used the service's default profile image -- two signs the accounts may be rarely used or inactive. Fourteen percent have automatically generated user names, another indication that an account may not belong to a real person.
Even if Mr. Trump is not shouting into the void on Twitter, he is often preaching to the converted. Data from Stirista, an analytics firm, shows that his followers tend to be the kind of users who are most likely to be his supporters -- disproportionately older, white and male compared with Twitter users over all.
And they constitute just a fraction of the electorate. According to the Times analysis of Pew data, only about four percent of American adults, or about 11 million people, follow him on Twitter. Those followers represent less that one-fifth of his total, the analysis shows.
According to data from YouGov, which polls about most of the president's tweets, some of the topics on which Mr. Trump got the most likes and retweets -- jabs at the N.F.L., posts about the special counsel's investigation, unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud -- poll poorly with the general public.
But people close to Mr. Trump said there was no dissuading him that the "likes" a tweet got were evidence that a decision or policy proposal was well received.
Last December, after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw some troops from Syria, lawmakers came to the White House to argue against it. According to Politico, Mr. Trump responded by calling in Mr. Scavino.
"Tell them how popular my policy is," Mr. Trump asked Mr. Scavino, who described for the lawmakers social media postings that had praised Mr. Trump's decision. Aides said that for Mr. Trump, his Twitter "likes" were proof that he had made the right call.
The reaction in the outside world was far less favorable. Within weeks, Mr. Trump's defense secretary and the special anti-ISIS envoy quit over the decision. American allies were enraged. More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to rebuke Mr. Trump, who agreed under pressure to keep the troops in Syria.
Almost a year later, American troops in Syria became an issue again after Mr. Trump appeared to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria.
That resulted in another congressional rebuke for Mr. Trump and complaints even from loyal Republican allies. In subsequent days, Mr. Trump sought to defend himself on Twitter, alternately denying he had abandoned the Kurds and suggesting the United States had no stake in their safety, threatening Mr. Erdogan if the incursion continued and praising Turkey as an important trading partner.
Many people took note of the back-and-forth, including Mr. Erdogan. "When we take a look at Mr. Trump's Twitter posts, we can no longer follow them," the Turkish president told reporters mockingly in mid-October, according to Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. "We cannot keep track."

A Tool for Re-Election
In the months ahead, the man tasked with winning Mr. Trump a second term is hoping to focus the president's Twitter habit on its original purpose: connecting with voters.
Brad Parscale, who served as Mr. Trump's digital director in 2016 and is now campaign manager, has worked closely with Mr. Scavino to shape perceptions of the president through social media. The two men speak a half-dozen times a day, according to people familiar with their interactions.
Mr. Parscale criticized Twitter after it announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow paid political advertising on the platform, calling it "yet another attempt to silence conservatives." But the change may benefit Mr. Trump: He has a far larger organic Twitter following than any of his likely Democratic opponents, and is therefore less reliant on paid ads to spread his message through the platform.
While some campaign aides say Mr. Trump's tweets can be a distraction, they also view Twitter as an essential tool to present him as someone strong, willing to stand up to so-called political elites and what the president recently called the "unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake-news media."
The aides seek to cultivate the image of a man who understands "regular people." Mr. Trump's team believes that his unvarnished writing, poor punctuation and increasing profanity on Twitter signals authenticity -- a contrast to the polished, vetted, often anodyne social media style of most candidates.
Twitter, Ms. Conway said, is the president's most potent weapon when it comes to bypassing the powerful people he believes have controlled the flow of information too long.
"It's the democratization of information," she said. Everyone receives Mr. Trump's tweets at once -- the stay-at-home mom, the plumber working on the sink, the billionaire executive, the White House correspondent.
"They all hear 'ping,"' she said, "at the same time."
The New York Times reviewed every tweet and retweet sent by President Trump from Jan. 20, 2017, through Oct. 15, 2019. Each one was evaluated and tagged for several factors: whether it included an attack or praise; who or what was attacked or praised; and for topics including trade, immigration, the military, the economy, the 2018 midterm elections, the Russia investigation and the House impeachment inquiry. In the Times analysis, retweets in each of those categories were counted as tweets.
The Times reviewed each Twitter account that followed Mr. Trump by analyzing profile information, tweet frequency and the date the account was created. The Times also used data from Pew Research to estimate how many American adults follow Mr. Trump on Twitter. Pew Research conducted a nationally representative sample of American adults with personal, public Twitter accounts to analyze how many follow American politicians.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — And then there was one.
Julián Castro became the sole Texan in the presidential race after Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign Friday, a sudden departure that creates new opportunity for Castro. But the former U.S. housing secretary is facing an uncertain fate of his own and trying to forge forward despite the long odds, sharpening his pitch as a unique advocate for the voiceless in the still-crowded primary field.
"This campaign has marched to the beat of its own drummer," Castro said Friday night here at the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration. "We've been a little bit different from all the other campaigns. We haven't been the same. We've been speaking up for the most vulnerable folks in this country — people sleeping on the streets and in storm drainage tunnels in Las Vegas, folks who are the victims of police brutality."
Still, Castro's message is colliding with cold hard political realities. While he met a self-imposed deadline Thursday to raise $800,000 or drop out, there is talk of potential staff departures soon, and it remains very unlikely he will qualify for the next debate on Nov. 20. He has the 165,000 donors required for the debate, but he has not yet received the 3% he needs in any of the four qualifying polls, and the deadline is 11 days away.
"For now, we're working like crazy to try and get on that November debate stage," Castro told reporters here Friday. Asked how realistic that goal is, Castro insisted he was "gonna keep working."
Castro said the $800,000 would be used to "keep the campaign going" and to air ads to boost his poll numbers in the early voting states. The money is expected to help pay staff for a little longer, but the campaign has also been open with staffers about imminent tough decisions and given them the green light to look elsewhere for work if they want to, according to people familiar with the campaign.
Those details were first reported Saturday by CNN. Castro spokesman Sawyer Hackett told the network that "in pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources."
Now that O'Rourke is no longer running, the campaign is increasing its focus on delegate-rich Texas, which holds its primary on March 3 — Super Tuesday. While Castro's poll numbers have never been as high as in Texas as O'Rourke's were — and he has not been as organized in the state as O'Rourke was — Castro's supporters see a new state of play at home.
"I understand [Joe] Biden and [Elizabeth] Warren have semblances of campaigns here, but I don’t think they were going to do what [Castro and O'Rourke] would be able to do," said state Rep. Poncho Nevárez, who has endorsed Castro. "I don’t see how this doesn’t benefit Julian. It's his opportunity. Maybe a lot of people didn’t see a path forward, but we had to assume that at some point a herd was going to get culled and if he can survive some of those first culls, and he has, then it becomes a different game.”
While zeroing in on Texas, Castro will also continue to focus on two states that he has previously suggested were priorities for his campaign: Iowa and Nevada, the first state in the nominating process with a significant Latino population. While there has not been much polling in Nevada — much to Castro's chagrin — he has been far behind in Iowa surveys, getting 0% in a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning.
Asked if there remains a path forward for Castro in Iowa, Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, responded in an email with a "no" and a straight-faced emoji. "I don’t see his slice of Iowa caucus participants," Schmidt said.
Still, Castro is determined to prove his bona fides as a candidate distinctly focused on the most vulnerable communities. On Friday afternoon, he bypassed the traditional activities before the state party dinner in downtown Des Moines to visit the nearby YMCA Supportive Housing Campus, which provides permanent housing and services to the homeless and those at risk of being homeless. Castro spent an hour and a half touring the facility and holding a roundtable with advocates, reminding them at one point that he has made housing a "front-and-center issue" in his campaign.
"We've been trying to address issues that a lot of other campaigns, for whatever other reason, don't want to address or don't take the time to address," Castro said at the roundtable's conclusion.
Castro continued to make a similar case at the Liberty and Justice Celebration, saying Democrats are "great at talking about the middle class — and we need to fight for the middle class and I'm fighting for the middle — but we also need to fight for the poor and those who have the least, those who suffer the most."

President Trump calls Pelosi's bluff

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the secret impeachment hearings in the Capitol basement as "a totally compromised kangaroo court." Sounds like Speaker Nancy Pelosi got the message. On Monday, she announced the full House will vote to formally launch impeachment proceedings, which will be out in the open instead of in the dark.
Until now, Democrats have been trying to trick the public into believing they've got the goods on Trump. But the truth is, none of the witnesses they've called so far have had any firsthand knowledge of presidential wrongdoing.
Behind closed doors and with no press allowed, House Democrats have tried to put on the appearance of a legal proceeding. At the end of each session, they leak to the press what they claim happened. The media are all too willing to play along, printing the Democratic pols' claims as if they were fact. "Powerful testimony from multiple state and national security officials," the Hill reports, adding up to a "scathing picture of Trump and his allies withholding nearly $400 million in security aid from Ukraine."
Politico called Ukrainian Ambassador Bill Taylor's testimony "explosive," though Taylor's prepared statement merely regurgitated what other State Department minions had told him. His source was the rumor mill. In law, it's called hearsay.
The New York Times reports "a rapidly moving investigation securing damning testimony." That's hardly the case. But soon the jig will be up. Regardless of how many "witnesses" the Dems parade into the Capitol hearing, it won't matter if they have no firsthand knowledge. Even the Times concedes that to impeach a president, the House needs proof "tying him directly" to wrongdoing.
Before Pelosi's announcement on Monday, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who's overseeing the secret hearings, gave up on calling witnesses who have direct, firsthand working relationships with Trump and can attest to what the president has said and done.
Schiff caved after a key witness actually challenged the committee's subpoena as illegitimate and said see you in court. Charles Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser -- and one of the few people who was on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president -- filed a lawsuit, arguing that the House committee can't compel testimony for an impeachment until the full House has voted to authorize subpoenas for that purpose. That, of course, is the vote Pelosi was dodging.
"We are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope with the courts," Schiff said. Translation: Dems don't think they'd win in the highest court.
They also don't want to risk dragging the inquiry on for months, as they did with the Mueller investigation. Better to ram anything through. After all, without evidence of grave wrongdoing, the Republican-controlled Senate won't remove this president from office. But Dems have one goal: to impeach Trump, damaging him enough to tip the 2020 election.
Schiff's cynical decision not to meet Kupperman in court indicates he's also not going to press for testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry or former National Security Adviser John Bolton -- advisers who actually know the facts about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump released the transcript of his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. He didn't have to. If there's any kind of presidential communication that's legally protected, it's conversation between two heads of state. Even so, Democrats and their media allies claim the call is damning evidence of a quid pro quo. All you have to do to see that that's false is read the words yourself.
The public's not stupid, and Pelosi is a far better politician than Schiff. Polls show fewer than half of voters support impeachment in key swing states like Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These are states Trump won in 2016, and Pelosi has been reluctant to put Democratic members from these states on the spot. But Trump's called her bluff. Now the Democrats will have to put up or shut up.

Have an extra hour? Try passing through the ‘Daylight Saving Doughnut’

Texto completo: Joshua and Hannah Bowman were driving through northeast Arizona on a cross-country road trip a few years ago, after deciding to move to California from Massachusetts. They had left Four Corners, safely taking U.S. Route 160 as evening rolled in, when something strange started happening on their phones.
“We saw that we were changing time zones fairly quickly,” Bowman said. “The twilight added a little bit to the mystery.”
Without knowing it, they had entered the Daylight Saving Doughnut.
[ Read how daylight savings affects your health ]
It’s that time again — daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday, when clocks are turned back one hour. And while most people in the United States get to enjoy an extra hour of sleep, confident their phones will attend to the task of winding back the clock, two states — Arizona and Hawaii — will not “fall back” because they did not “spring forward.”
But what does that have to do with doughnuts?
OK, not all of Arizona holds out on daylight saving. In the northeastern quarter of the state, the Navajo Nation observes the time change in the spring.
But the Hopi Nation, which is encircled by Navajo territory, does not, making it the figurative “doughnut hole.”
The Navajo Nation is semiautonomous, with the power to set its own time system. Since the Navajo reservation extends into neighboring states that recognize daylight saving time — Utah and New Mexico — the nation decided to follow suit to keep the same time throughout its land.
“That means every summer, you have the Hopi Reservation with standard time, surrounded by the Navajo Reservation with daylight time, surrounded by the state of Arizona in standard time,” said David Prerau, a time policy expert and the author of “Seize the Daylight.”
“It is a very interesting, and confusing situation, and they’ve had that for years.”
The time change on Sunday brings everyone to standard time.
Who decided the rules for daylight saving time to begin with?
To understand how we got to where we are, we have to turn back time to the years after World War II, when there was no uniform national system.
At one point, there were 23 different pairs of daylight saving start and end dates in the state of Iowa. There was also a bus route that ran between Moundsville, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, that saw passengers changing time zones seven times in only a 35-mile stretch.
“Anybody could do what they wanted,” Prerau said. “You had a lot of unusual circumstances.”
But in 1966 Congress established the Uniform Time Act, which standardized daylight saving time across the country. Any state could exempt itself, and Arizona opted out of the law in 1967.
Why did Arizona get rid of it?
If you ask an Arizonan, they’ll probably tell you it’s all about energy conservation.
“It’s not unique to Arizona culturally, it’s more geographic,” said Calvin Schermerhorn, a professor of history at Arizona State University.
Arizona’s most populated areas, around Tucson and Phoenix, are very, very hot in the summer, and an extra hour of daylight to stay outdoors was not an incentive. Rather, the best time to go outside is often after the sun goes down.
“Instead of saving fuel, daylight saving time saw more fuel being spent on air conditioning, because of the extra hour of daylight” at the end of the day, Schermerhorn said.
But even now, there are those who would rather see Arizona follow daylight saving time. Many issues arise while traveling to, from or through the state. Businesses have complained of difficulties coordinating with their national or global branches. Communication is a problem, with many missed calls.
“It puts Arizona out of sync with everybody else,” Prerau said.
Are any other states going to make the change?
Hawaii’s choice against observing daylight saving time causes less disruption than Arizona’s given that it is isolated from other states and near the Equator, where the sunrises and sunsets don’t vary much.
Several overseas territories, including American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also do not observe daylight saving time.
And many other states are pushing to drop daylight saving time all together. Over the past few years states including Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Alaska, Texas, Utah and Washington have pushed back against daylight saving time.
But others have fought to permanently stay in daylight saving time. Proposals have been filed in Florida, Idaho, Oregon and New Mexico.
“We’re marching away from that uniformity, which could wreak havoc on all the systems that rely on synchronized time,” Schermerhorn said.
There is support for getting rid of the time changes. Seven in 10 Americans would rather not have to switch their clocks twice a year, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released this past week.
What is less clear is whether they want to stay on standard time year round, or daylight time. Four in 10 Americans would like to stay on standard time, the poll found, while about three in 10 prefer full-time daylight time.
Even if everyone was on the same page with daylight saving, there would still be temporal fissures across the nation, with 14 states split by two different time zones. There are even some instances of towns which recognize time zones unofficially, such as Kenton, Oklahoma, in the western edge of the Panhandle. Officially, it’s on Central Time, but the town informally follows Mountain Time to be in sync with New Mexico, which is only 3 miles away.

Texto completo: Los críticos del presidente Donald Trump se burlaron en internet y lo acusaron de intentar aligerar su factura de impuestos después de que anunció el jueves que su residencia permanente sería Palm Beach, Florida, en lugar de la Torre Trump en Nueva York.
“Donald Trump no quiere que el estado de Nueva York vea sus impuestos, me pregunto por qué. Digamos esto como es: corrupción, simple y llanamente”, tuiteó el jueves la senadora Elizabeth Warren , candidata presidencial para las elecciones de 2020.
Trump, un neoyorquino de toda la vida, presentó una “declaración de domicilio” ante el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Palm Beach en septiembre, renunciando a su residencia en Nueva York y designando el resort Mar-a-Lago de la familia como su residencia principal, según The New York Times. El diario, que informó por primera vez el cambio de residencia de Trump, dijo que la medida tiene motivos fiscales: Florida en particular no tiene impuestos estatales sobre la renta o la herencia.
En Nueva York, Trump enfrenta el escrutinio tanto del fiscal general del estado como del fiscal de distrito de Manhattan sobre sus declaraciones de impuestos.
“Los estadounidenses de a pie no son dueños de resorts que pueden enumerar como direcciones alternativas para modificar su obligación tributaria”, tuiteó el jueves la representante Nita Lowey, demócrata de Nueva York. “Las familias de clase media hoy enfrentan más cargas impositivas mientras el presidente esquiva las consecuencias del proyecto de ley republicano”.
Dan Pfeiffer, exasesor de Obama, bromeó en un tuit el jueves: “El presidente huye a Florida para evitar pagar impuestos”.
Trump tuiteó el jueves por la noche que apreciaba su ciudad natal y “odiaba tener que tomar esta decisión”, pero “a pesar del hecho de que pago millones de dólares en impuestos municipales, estatales y locales cada año, los líderes políticos me han tratado muy mal, tanto de la ciudad como del estado “.
Agregó que Nueva York “siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi corazón”.
La exrepresentante Gwen Graham, demócrata de Florida, reaccionó a la noticia con solo cuatro palabras: “Nosotros. No. Lo. queremos”.
Y Michael Steele, ex presidente del Comité Nacional Republicano, tuiteó: “Maldita sea, habrás sacado a Trump de #NYC”. #PobreFlorida “.
El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, demócrata y ex candidato de 2020, también opinó.
“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

Texto completo: Following his breakout debate performance, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has surged into striking distance of a win in Iowa, putting up his best showing in recent polls in the state with the first nominating contest.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning, the mayor of South Bend is polling at 18%, behind Elizabeth Warren at 22% and Bernie Sanders at 19%. He edged out Joe Biden, who entered the race at the top of the polls in Iowa, but slipped to fourth place at 17%.
The poll has a margin of error of 4.7%, meaning the race remains tight, with the top three in a statistical tie. The remaining candidates are polling at 4% or less.
In some ways it's no surprise. Pundits think Buttigieg is positioned to contend in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but caution his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
"He's bound to do well in Iowa," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "He's Midwestern and Iowa is 90 percent white. I'm still very skeptical that he can go on to win the nomination (given his lack of support among African Americans). I just don't see how he does it."
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife this summer.
It's not his only obstacle. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isn't as high as among other groups, a potential problem for the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president.
Still, pundits say a win in Iowa would give him more time to win over those voters. And if Biden continues to stumble, many might be looking for a more moderate candidate than Warren and Sanders, a point Buttigieg reinforced again and again at the October debate.
"If he can be successful in Iowa and in New Hampshire that gives him more time and opportunity to really reach out to voters and try to get them on his side," said Laura Merrifield Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis.
In fact, the national takeaway from the recent polls has been the continuing collapse of Biden, pundits say, which is leaving the door open for other candidates like Buttigieg.
"Biden is now, I think you can make an argument that he's out in Iowa and New Hampshire," Sabato said. "That ought to be a concern for him, though he has a chance to recover in South Carolina (where he remains popular with African American voters)."
The poll had more good news for Buttigieg, who has been positioning himself as a moderate alternative to the former vice president. The South Bend mayor is the second choice of 31% of caucus goers, behind only Sanders at 34%.
Buttigieg fared somewhat better with older voters than younger voters, according to the poll.
There was some bad news for him, too. Among the top four candidates, voters were the least confident in his chances of defeating President Donald Trump, at 70%. Warren was at 81%, Biden at 80% and Sanders at 76%.
The poll of 439 Iowa Democratic caucus goers was conducted Oct. 25-30.
Buttigieg has been a leader in collecting campaign money, and he appears to be putting it to good use, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics.
"It's being put to work in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and we'll see if the same sort of thing can happen (elsewhere)," Downs said.
The survey comes just a week after Buttigieg polled at 20% in the latest Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, behind only Warren at 28%.
Sanders was at 18% and Biden at 12% in that poll of 598 likely Democratic caucus attendees surveyed between October 18-22. The margin of error was 5%.
Buttigieg moved up from fourth place in the same poll in September.
There was trouble for the mayor in this poll, too, foreshadowing his issues in more diverse states.
Among non white voters in Iowa, Buttigieg was at fifth place at 9%, behind Biden, Warrem, Sanders and Kamala Harris. The mayor also ranked poorly as a second choice, ranking behind Warren, Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.

DES MOINES, Iowa—Thirteen Democratic presidential candidates addressed roughly 13,000 Democrats at the Wells Fargo Arena here, hoping to replicate Barack Obama's performance at a similar event 12 years ago that started his path to the party's nomination.
In the crowded 2020 field, with each candidate getting 10 minutes over the course of more than four hours, there was no single breakout performance like Mr. Obama's.
Here are several moments that mattered with less than 100 days until the first nominating contest:
"I'm here to launch the era that must come next."
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg almost immediately invoked Mr. Obama, pitching himself as the young Washington outsider capable of uniting the country after what is likely to be a divisive general election. "The first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate—a young man with a funny name," he said.

Mr. Buttigieg's supporters took some cues from Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. Clad in bright yellow and lights, they clapped thunder sticks together loudly and took over the largest section of the arena.
"We knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now," Mr. Buttigieg said.
Hundreds of his backers, who deemed themselves the "barnstormers," traveled from around the country to see Mr. Buttigieg. Lynn Wilson, a nurse from Rochester, Minn., described him as "hope personified."
Mr. Buttigieg has been enjoying a bump in recent polling. A Friday New York Times/Siena College poll had Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden all effectively tied among Democratic primary voters in Iowa, close behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
"Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory."
Ms. Warren, who rarely veers off her usual campaign speech, made a more forceful case for the "big structural change" her campaign is centered on. With the moderates in the race targeting her more aggressively, Ms. Warren used part of her speech to respond to her critics.

"Look, anyone who comes on this stage and doesn't understand that we're already in a fight is not the person who is going to win that fight," she said.
"I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed to not offend anyone," Ms. Warren added.
Mr. Biden—along with Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who are all seeking to win over more moderate Midwestern voters—have been going after Ms. Warren lately over her support for a government-run health-care plan that would eliminate private insurers.
"Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation."
California Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been fading in polls as her campaign goes all-in on Iowa, emphasized her experience as a prosecutor, including a line that could be seen as a shot at Ms. Warren.
"I've never represented a special interest," Ms. Harris said. "I've always represented the people."
Ms. Warren's work for corporations while she was a law professor has come under scrutiny from some liberals. As an expert on bankruptcy, she made hundreds of thousands of dollars representing corporate clients. Her campaign has disclosed 50 cases she was involved in on its website.
Ms. Harris, whose campaign was hoping to use her speech Friday to reboot her candidacy, got one of loudest receptions from the crowd.
"This is like a general election in a primary."
Mr. Biden, who has been fighting to hold on to his front-runner status, continued to stress to caucus-goers that he was the best candidate to take on President Trump, saying Republicans have already turned their firepower on him.

"Folks, it's the reason he's spending so much money with his henchmen in running ads against me in a primary. This is just like a general election, in a primary," Mr. Biden said. "He knows I will beat him like a drum."
Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in part over efforts to press Ukraine to launch an investigation into Mr. Biden and his family. Mr. Trump and the GOP have accused Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden of profiting off his father's name.
"I see you, I love you."
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker received a standing ovation for his speech pushing unity. He began by talking about a mentor whose last words were "I see you, I love you."
"I hear the pundits say this about who's polling the best or who has the most money or who can best deliver a shot against another Democrat on a stage," Mr. Booker said. "This is going to be best decided by who can best pull us to our common aspiration, who can best inspire us to be the truth of who we are."
So far, Mr. Booker's positive message has failed to garner strong support. He averages in the low-single digits in national and early state polls.
Other low-polling candidates failed to even get a proper introduction. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney was introduced with photos of Montana Gov. Steve Bullock on the screens behind the stage. When it was Mr. Bullock's turn, the announcer introduced him as Mr. Booker.

REVIEW --- Table Talk: The Misguided Obsession With 'Authentic' Food --- What should matter in cooking a dish isn't whether it conforms to an original recipe but whether its innovations taste good.

Texto completo: If you want to see how our values change over time, look no further than the kitchen. So many things that once seemed absolutely vital about food just fade away and become an irrelevance. Take sauces. Knowing the "right" French sauce for each dish used to be one of the tests of a cook, but now in these more globalized times, few people would expect you to know your bearnaise from your soubise.
Another idea that I suspect -- and hope -- is on the way out is the insistence on "authenticity."
You can tie yourself in knots trying to source the ingredients to make the most supposedly authentic version of a particular dish. Is the olive oil in your Ligurian pesto the right one? Does your paella contain the required snails? The truth, however, is that no recipe is ever truly authentic. A dish is always borrowed or tweaked from somewhere else, and that is no bad thing.
A couple of years ago, the Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi, who is famous for his inventive flavors, was vilified by readers on the Guardian website for publishing an online recipe for Irish stew. Mr. Ottolenghi made no pretense that his stew was anything anyone would recognize in Ireland, where the original stew is nothing but mutton, potatoes, onions and water. His version -- an homage to his Irish husband -- contained white wine and herbs and was finished with an aromatic paste of orange zest, garlic and parsley. He saw these additions as a way to adapt Irish stew to his own palate. But to the chef's online critics, these tasty seasonings, especially the orange zest, were a violation of the holy memory of the original Irish stew.
The cult of authenticity is based on the idea that recipes are suspended in time and place, like berries in an old-fashioned Jell-O mold. Yet since the discovery of fire, every generation of cooks has rewritten the rule book of cooking, depending on the ingredients and resources available and the tastes of the times. Modern apples tend to be sweeter than older varieties, so to make an apple pie that tastes authentically like one of the 1950s, you would need to use less sugar.
Even in Ireland, stew is evolving. I recently ate the best Irish stew of my life at a restaurant in Galway run by a brilliant chef from New Zealand named Jess Murphy. In place of potatoes, Ms. Murphy uses an assortment of local root vegetables and seasons the broth with lovage, an herb that tastes like celery, only earthier. Alongside the stew was a damp dark soda bread and superb Irish butter.
If her Irish customers were offended by her updated stew, they showed no sign of it. Sipping the delicious lovage-scented broth, it suddenly occurred to me that it's more respectful to a dish to cook it and keep it alive than it is to insist on making it the exact same way it happened to be made a hundred years ago.
"Who cares if it's authentic, so long as it tastes good?" Mr. Ottolenghi remarked at London's National Theatre in London in August, talking about the Irish stew affair. I was on stage with him and cookery writer Nigella Lawson, talking about "food and identity." Both said that when it comes to food, authenticity is not as important as cooking something authentically delicious. Ms. Lawson said she believed it was important to respect the origins of a recipe and to acknowledge its roots but also to recognize that cooking traditions are always changing.
It's hard enough making time for cooking in the modern world without giving yourself the added burden of authenticity to live up to. A few months ago, the journalist Stephen S. Hall traveled to the city of Amatrice in the Lazio region of Italy for the New York Times, in search of the "real" pasta all'Amatriciana -- the deliciously comforting sauce of tomatoes and cured pork. What he discovered was that he had been cooking his favorite pasta dish "wrong" for the past 40 years.
Following Marcella Hazan's classic recipe, Mr. Hall had always made his Amatriciana with pancetta, butter and onions (a recipe that I can confirm is pure comfort), yet he found that in Amatrice, onions and butter were never added to the dish. The true Amatriciana, he found, contained only tomato sauce, pecorino and guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), which has a sweeter taste than pancetta. Locals were horrified when he confessed to using pancetta in his Amatriciana.
Is using pancetta instead of guanciale really such a crime? The thing that gets missed by those who cling to the idea of authentic food is that when you change the context of the cooking, you change the meaning. In Amatrice, guanciale is used in pasta dishes because it is a normal, everyday item. Outside of Italy, as Marcella Hazan wrote, "pork jowl is hard to get," and therefore it's a reasonable choice -- and true to the original spirit of the dish -- to substitute something that's easier to find.
I am not suggesting for a moment that we should pay no regard to the origin of dishes. A British chain, Marks and Spencer, recently caused offense by selling a vegan wrap sandwich that was labeled as biryani -- biryani being a noble and festive Indian rice dish. This wasn't so much an adaptation as an outright piece of misdescription.
But when it comes to authenticity there are bigger fish to fry than whether you used exactly the right variety of wine in your osso bucco. Our stores are full of items that claim to be something they are not. We are sold lemonade that contains no lemons and berry-flavor breakfast cereals that never saw a piece of fruit. A 2010-2012 report on seafood fraud by the nonprofit Oceana found that much of the fish for sale in the U.S. was mislabeled. The group found, for instance, that 87% of the "snapper"" on sale was mislabeled (it was mostly tilapia).
Rather than devoting so much of our energy and attention to searching for the authentic, we could ask a simpler question of our food. Is it real?

Texto completo: Bloodless revolutions from Armenia to Lebanon are about ending the fatalism corrupt rule engenders.
YEREVAN, Armenia -- It has been 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A guard threw open a gate, the Soviet imperium folded, more than 100 million people in Central and Eastern Europe were freed, a divided continent was made whole, and the end of history was announced.
What to make of the three decades after Nov. 9, 1989? Poverty receded. Lives got longer. Human exchange became borderless. Artificial intelligence started making things smart. China rose, as did sea levels. The United States, attacked and wounded, tried managed decline, and at last, in wild frustration, elected a loudmouthed con man to its highest office. History, not terminated after all, ushered in a new wave of nationalism, nativism and xenophobia.
Water is the new oil. Data is the new plutonium. Climate is the new Armageddon. The talk in 1990 of the inevitability of a world of liberal democracy turned to predictions of a world of autocrats buttressed by the surveillance states that technology has enabled. It has proved impossible for technology companies to do no evil.
The best of all possible worlds was deferred yet again. Joachim Gauck, the Lutheran pastor and anti-Communist East German activist who later became president of a united Germany, captured the illusions and shattered hopes of 1989 best: "We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North Rhine-Westphalia."
Of course, North Rhine-Westphalia is not bad, but in our polarized all-or-nothing political age not bad is generally not good enough. In the forgotten-words stakes, compromise rivals statesmanship.
Big things changed, and small. My lackluster soccer club, Chelsea, got a Russian oligarch as owner and, with his billions, started winning trophies. I'd never thought the fall of Communism could so directly affect my mood. The Russians arrived -- on the Côte d'Azur, on the beaches of Vietnam and, of course, in Syria. And here in Armenia, the great Armenian saga of tragedy, migration, reinvention and survival took another twist.
The Soviet Union fell apart. The Republic of Armenia became an independent state in 1991. It got a tiny piece of the worst possible real estate Armenia had occupied over the millenniums of its history, but still it was something.
In every office there are images of Mount Ararat, which rises in Turkey, a symbol for Armenians of longing, pride, the hope of return and the suffering of the Armenian genocide that began in 1915 and involved the Ottoman Empire's killing of more than one million Armenians.
The House of Representatives, defying familiar Turkish warnings, this week passed a resolution recognizing that genocide. President Barack Obama never recognized it publicly, despite a promise to do so as a presidential candidate in 2008. Realpolitik won out over his principles.
Turkey, which insists there was no organized campaign to slaughter Armenians, is not Armenia's only problem. Comrade Stalin loved to tinker with nationalities and borders. Decades later, this caused friction between Armenia and Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union collapsed. The disputes culminated in war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region a quarter-century ago. Today, Armenia's border with Azerbaijan is closed. Its border with Turkey is closed. Only the borders with Georgia and Iran are open.
Yet I found Armenians in upbeat mood! What do physical borders matter these days? The nearly three million citizens of Armenia are in constant touch with the many more millions of Armenians in the diaspora, who are sending money home. With a strong tech sector, Armenia sees itself as a start-up country. It's looking forward more than back.
The country's bloodless revolution in 2018 has not delivered paradise, but it has eliminated fatalism. People feel they have the freedom to try what they want.
Weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism brought down the old Armenian political class, much as massive demonstrations in Beirut, Baghdad and Santiago in recent weeks have brought down or shaken the governments of Lebanon, Iraq and Chile.
The spirit of 1989 has not been trampled underfoot by Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, after all. People prefer agency to the dead hand of unaccountable rule. They prefer the rule of law to arbitrary arrest. That's why they are in the streets of Hong Kong.
Liberal democracy is not, as Putin has insisted, "obsolete." It just needed a jolt.
Armen Sarkissian, the Armenian president, told me in an interview that old systems would not work. "We are living in a quantum world because more than half of life is virtual," he said. The notion of democracies functioning through elections every few years is outdated. He called Armenia "one of the first labs" to find new "rules or behavior" for a world where every individual has a voice that "is exercised and expressed daily."
On the Armenian genocide, and Turkey's denial, Sarkissian said this: "Recognition of something that you have done wrong in ordinary life, in your family, with your friends, recognition is a strength. It's not a weakness. If you take Turkey recognizing the Armenian genocide, that will also be recognition of the fact Turkey is on its way to become a tolerant state."
One enduring lesson of 1989 is that the truth will out. Even the Trump White House will one day discover this.

DES MOINES, Iowa—The leading Democratic presidential contenders, bunched together in the latest Iowa poll, sought to separate themselves from the pack in a high-stakes audition Friday night just three months before this state's leadoff caucuses.
In back-to-back speeches before roughly 13,000 Democratic Party activists, the candidates rarely spoke about an effort to impeach President Trump and instead offered a stark choice over their own party's future: dramatic change or building on the policies of former President Obama.
The gathering itself was heavy on spectacle and ear-piercing at times. The candidates, who mostly spoke without notes, had 10 minutes to make their pitch in an arena filled with signs, thunder sticks and campaign T-shirts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democrat do you think has the best chance to win the February Iowa caucuses? Why? Join the conversation below.
The 13 candidates who spoke at the Liberty and Justice Celebration sought the kind of breakout moment recorded a dozen years ago at a similar event by Mr. Obama, then the junior senator from Illinois and trailing in the polls. The dinner was the final major Iowa organizing event before the Feb. 3 caucuses, when participants must attend hourslong gatherings on an often-frigid winter night.
The candidates took the stage as a new survey showed a tight race in Iowa. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 22%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 19%, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., at 18% and former Vice President Joe Biden at 17%.
The survey is the latest warning sign for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April as the leading contender in Iowa and nationally. He still leads in most national polls, but his weakness in a state that ended his last presidential bid in 2008 has raised concerns about his ability to challenge Mr. Trump.
His uneven performances on the campaign trail and in the debates have presented an opening for other moderate candidates in the race, including Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

'I'm here to launch the era that must come next,' said candidate Pete Buttigieg at Friday's event. PHOTO: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal
Mr. Buttigieg was the first candidate to take the stage and most directly compared himself to Mr. Obama in a bid to present himself as an heir to the former president's legacy. Mr. Buttigieg noted that more than a decade ago he was an organizer in Iowa for "a young man with a funny name," a reference to his own age and hard-to-pronounce name.
"We knew the stakes were high then," Mr. Buttigieg, 37 years old, said. "The stakes are colossal now."
Mr. Buttigieg had one of the largest and loudest groups of supporters. As he walked on stage, his supporters turned on flashing green and blue LED lights that framed signs reading "BOOT EDGE EDGE."
"I'm here to launch the era that must come next," he said. "I am ready to gather up an American majority that is hungry for change, that is done with division."
Ms. Warren embraced the mantle of the race's agent of change, pointing to 2020 as the year to win the fight for liberal causes such as a Green New Deal , Medicare for All and her signature tax on the wealthiest Americans .
"Anyone who comes on stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory," she said, decrying a campaign that "nibbles around the edges" in a veiled shot at Mr. Biden.
"If the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose," she said.

In his remarks, Mr. Biden made no mention of Ms. Warren but sought to offer a contrast to her on health care in the hours after she rolled out a plan on how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal .
Mr. Biden said the next administration needed to "build upon the Affordable Care Act, not abandon it," adding, "We can do it quickly without taxing the middle class."
Going further, Mr. Biden pledged that there would be "no increases in taxes for the middle class, none, none, none."
The decibel level inside the arena was significantly lower during Mr. Biden's speech compared with those by Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who has sought to reboot her campaign in recent days , took a swipe at Ms. Warren, who served as a corporate consultant while teaching at Harvard Law School.
"Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation. I've never represented a special interest," Ms. Harris said, recalling her work as a California prosecutor "for the people."
Mr. Sanders, unlike the other top candidates, used a lectern for his speech, predicting that the president "will soon be impeached."
But Mr. Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in 2016, devoted much of his remarks to the areas of disagreement in the party. He said Democrats would need to decide whether to continue "status quo politics" or change.
"The Democratic Party must become the party of the working-class of this country, not of super PACs, not of corporate interests, not of their lobbyists," Mr. Sanders said.
The senator had virtually no supporters in the arena because his campaign opted instead to host a separate event nearby. An aide said the campaign donated $20,000 to the state party instead of purchasing seats in the arena.
Also absent was Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who dropped out of the race two hours before the event began. He had struggled to raise money recently and based on his most recent polling was unlikely to meet the necessary threshold to qualify for the fifth debate later this month.

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened Thursday
— The House voted 232-196 to formalize the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, marking the first time since the inquiry began that members were forced to go on record either in support or opposition to it. It was a largely party line vote, with no Republicans supporting the House resolution, and two all but Democrats voting in favor. The Globe's Jazmine Ulloa and Ryan Wangman describe the mood on Capitol Hill.
— White House national security aide Tim Morrison confirmed testimony that EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland told Morrison of an explicit quid pro quo related to Ukraine: That promised military aid would not be sent until Ukraine's president committed to investigating Trump's political rivals.
What's expected to happen next
— Though lawmakers break today for recess, and will return on Nov. 12, several Trump administration officials are scheduled be deposed by investigators on Monday, including a top aide to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. It's unlear whether those depositions will take place because the officials haven't responded to subpoenas.
— House Democratic leaders would like to see public hearings wrapped up by Thanksgiving, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: In a federal complaint, a former chief of staff to Mr. Neumann said she was demoted twice after she became pregnant.
When the chief of staff to the WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann became pregnant in March 2016, she was reluctant to share the news with her boss right away.
But ultimately, the employee, Medina Bardhi, felt she had no choice. She had to explain that she could no longer accompany Mr. Neumann on business trips "due to his penchant for bringing marijuana on chartered flights and smoking it throughout the flight while in an enclosed cabin," according to a complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in New York on Thursday.
What followed, the complaint said, was a pattern of discrimination, as Ms. Bardhi was repeatedly derided and marginalized by Mr. Neumann and other WeWork officials. Mr. Neumann referred to her maternity leave as a "vacation" or "retirement," according to the complaint, and another high-level company official, Jennifer Berrent, commented, "Wow, you're getting big," in front of a WeWork executive.
Mr. Neumann, who had promised to champion women at WeWork, stepped down as the company's chief executive in September as its attempted initial public offering collapsed in dramatic fashion. As part of a deal to turn over control of WeWork to its largest outside investor, SoftBank, he received $ 185 million to work as a consultant to the company for four years.
Over the last year, other women, including a senior executive, have filed lawsuits accusing WeWork of gender discrimination. Their complaints have added to the storm of criticism WeWork and Mr. Neumann have faced from bankers, analysts and current and former employees since the attempt to go public failed. Mr. Neumann's leadership has come under particularly intense scrutiny: He has been criticized for maintaining a lavish lifestyle and giving outsize power to family members, including his wife, Rebekah.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Neumann declined to comment, referring questions to WeWork. In a statement, a WeWork spokeswoman, Gwen Rocco, said the company "intends to vigorously defend itself against" the complaint.
"We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind," Ms. Rocco said. "We are committed to moving the company forward and building a company and culture that our employees can be proud of."
During her five years at WeWork, Ms. Bardhi became pregnant twice and was demoted both times, the complaint said. She was fired in early October, shortly after Mr. Neumann left, according to the complaint. Company executives told her that "there was no longer a role for her after Mr. Neumann's departure," the complaint said.
"This assertion and supposed justification rings hollow, as Ms. Bardhi already had been pushed out of Mr. Neumann's office," the complaint said. "It is clear that Ms. Bardhi's firing was motivated by the Company's sustained discriminatory bias and retaliatory animus against her and other female employees who become pregnant, take maternity leave, and/or complain about gender-based discrimination."
The complaint also said that WeWork had a broader culture of abuse and disrespect toward women -- a work environment in which excessive alcohol consumption fueled "offensive sexual conduct" and women were routinely paid less than male colleagues with similar jobs.
Ms. Bardhi's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said he hoped that the E.E.O.C. would view her experiences as part of a systemic problem at the company and bring class-action charges against WeWork.
The discrimination Ms. Bardhi faced began before she even started at WeWork, the complaint said. During a job interview in October 2013, Mr. Neumann "unlawfully and intrusively" asked Ms. Bardhi whether she planned to get married or become pregnant -- a question that left her "stunned and uncomfortable," according to the complaint.
When Ms. Bardhi became pregnant three years later, the complaint said, Mr. Neumann replaced her with a male employee who was paid more than twice as much.
Then, rather than restoring her to the job of chief of staff when she returned from maternity leave, the complaint said, the company gave her no clear direction on her day-to-day responsibilities.
Eventually, she got the job back, the complaint said. But when she became pregnant a second time in February 2018, the cycle repeated -- a male employee was hired to replace her, and she found herself sidelined when she returned to work.
"She was given no information about what her new role would be," the complaint said. "This was obvious retaliation for her taking maternity leave and discrimination against a pregnant employee and new mother."
Her difficulties continued during the buildup to the failed initial public offering, the complaint said. As Mr. Neumann and Ms. Bardhi drove back from the offices of JPMorgan Chase on Sept. 16, the complaint said, Mr. Neumann said to her, "I hope you enjoyed your vacation."
Mr. Neumann founded WeWork, which leases office space, on an idealistic promise to change the way people work and elevate global consciousness. And he pledged to make the start-up an inviting place for women.
"We like to say that right now we're bringing in the most talented women in the world at an early stage," he said in an interview hosted by the Economic Club of New York in 2017. "We're going to grow them all as leaders."
As the company has gained prominence, however, news reports and court filings have painted a picture of a raucous workplace with a culture of heavy drinking where complaints of sexism and even harassment went unheeded.
Now the company is aiming to reinvent itself without its erratic founder.
After weeks of uncertainty about its future, WeWork got a last-ditch lifeline earlier this month, when SoftBank launched a multibillion-dollar takeover, installing one of its own top managers, Marcelo Claure, as executive chairman.

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
RACHEL FEINSTEIN at Gotham Comedy Club (Nov. 1-2, 8 and 10 p.m.). This stand-up is one of the girls on the Spotify podcast "3 Girls, 1 Keith" (the other two are Amy Schumer and Bridget Everett; the Keith is Keith Robinson). She also released an hourlong stand-up special on Comedy Central in 2016 and a half-hour spot on Season 2 of Netflix's "The Standups." On Friday and Saturday, she headlines this venerable comedy club in Chelsea.

'KREEPS WITH KIDS' at St. George Theater (Nov. 2, 8 p.m.). The four stand-ups headlining this tour -- Ron Bennington, a SiriusXM host; Jim Florentine, a "Crank Yankers" voice actor; Robert Kelly; and Rich Vos -- have more in common than just being fathers. They found their warped sensibilities mesh well onstage, so they decided to go out on the road together. They're all based in the tristate area, but Staten Island is so far their only New York City stop on this tour.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
NICK OFFERMAN at Beacon Theater (Nov. 3, 7:30 p.m.). This actor, who became widely known from his role on NBC's "Parks and Recreation," has written four New York Times best sellers this decade: "Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living," "Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom With America's Gutsiest Troublemakers," "Good Clean Fun: Misadventures in Sawdust at Offerman Woodshop," and, with his wife, the actress Megan Mullally, "The Greatest Love Story Ever Told." Currently he co-hosts the NBC show "Making It." This is his first theater tour since 2017.
212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com
'JULIA SWEENEY: OLDER AND WIDER' at Joe's Pub (Nov. 3, 7 p.m.). In the 1990s and 2000s, Sweeney was a cast member on "Saturday Night Live," starred in "It's Pat: The Movie," appeared on TV shows such as "Frasier" and "Sex and the City," and performed one-handers such as "God Said, 'Ha!"' and "In the Family Way." Then, for about a decade, Sweeney, who currently co-stars in the Hulu series "Shrill," took a breather from Hollywood to spend time with her husband and child in Chicago. In this, her latest monologue, she will fill us in on those years.
212-967-7555, joespub.com
'WE HEART JOAN' at Housing Works Bookstore Cafe (Nov. 1, 7 p.m.). The estate of Joan Rivers is donating some of her items to Housing Works, posthumously continuing the comedian's support for New Yorkers with AIDS. This SoHo bookstore will celebrate Rivers with an auction of these items and a showcase of some of the city's current funny ladies, hosted by Macy Rodman and Theda Hammel. Catherine Cohen, Mo Fry Pasic, Rachel Pegram and Sydnee Washington will perform.

TWITTER TO BAN POLITICAL ADS, UNLIKE FACEBOOK POLICY

Texto completo: As Facebook continues to defend its controversial policy that allows politicians to run false advertising, Twitter said Wednesday it is pulling the plug on political ads altogether.
"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday. "We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought."
The new policy, effective Nov. 22, will apply to candidate and issue ads.
"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions," Dorsey added.
If that sounds familiar, it's because online misinformation has been shown to have played a key part in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Dorsey and the top executives of Facebook and Google all have testified before Congress over Russian misinformation campaigns run on their social media platforms, among other things.
Some are cheering Twitter's move which could negatively affect its already declining revenue while also pointing out that the company hasn't solved its misinformation problem. So far, the company has offered no antidote for politicians who make false statements in their own tweets.
"Rather than taking the Facebook route and letting anarchy ensue, Twitter is taking responsibility," said Eric Goldman, director of the Santa Clara University School of Law's High Tech Law Institute. "But it's still allowing politicians to lie without consequence."
Goldman said it's not just about President Donald Trump, whose online megaphone of choice is Twitter.
"Trump is a symptom of the disease," he said. "The disease is: Politicians will lie if given the chance." Goldman believes politicians currently in office shouldn't be allowed on Twitter or any other platform where they can spread their messages unfiltered.
Twitter's much bigger competitor, Facebook, has been under fire for refusing to take down an ad by Trump's reelection campaign that included accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden that have been proven false. Facebook said it does not fact-check political ads and has no intention of doing so.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the policy is a matter of freedom of expression. During Wednesday's earnings call, he dug in and pointed out that TV networks and Google run political ads, too. He also said that political ads will bring in only 0.5% of the company's revenue this year.
People such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren have sharply criticized Facebook's policy. Warren ran a false ad on Facebook claiming that the tech company is supporting Trump's reelection, which it is not to illustrate her point.
Bernice King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr., also has been critical of Facebook recently because Zuckerberg invoked her father while defending the tech giant's policy. She tweeted a couple of weeks ago: "I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination." On Wednesday, she wrote in a tweet directed at Dorsey, "Thank you, @jack, for taking the lead on responsible sharing of political ads via social media."
Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's questioning of Zuckerberg exposed holes in Facebook's policy of not checking facts in political ads. When the congresswoman from New York asked the CEO whether she would be able to buy an ad that would target black voters and give them an incorrect election date, he said no. Their exchange has inspired many memes.
In addition, The New York Times this week published a letter sent to Zuckerberg by 250 of his own employees in which they said, "Misinformation affects us all" and "Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing." It was a rare public show of dissent within Facebook.
One San Francisco man is going so far as declaring himself a candidate for California governor to further highlight Facebook's policy. He argues that if Trump can run false ads on Facebook, why can't he?
Adriel Hampton this week registered for the 2022 gubernatorial race, but Facebook has blocked a false ad he tried to run.
"The problem here is regular people in America are being abused by the corporate state," Hampton said Wednesday in an interview with this news organization. He said he's considering suing Facebook over its blocking of his ad and that he plans to produce a whole bunch of fake video ads for other political candidates who also want to call out Facebook over its policy.
Facebook has not returned a request for comment about Hampton.

The Misguided Obsession With 'Authentic' Food; What should matter in cooking a dish isn't whether it conforms to an original recipe but whether its innovations taste good

Texto completo: PHOTO: Gwenda Kaczor
If you want to see how our values change over time, look no further than the kitchen. So many things that once seemed absolutely vital about food just fade away and become an irrelevance. Take sauces. Knowing the "right" French sauce for each dish used to be one of the tests of a cook, but now in these more globalized times, few people would expect you to know your béarnaise from your soubise.
Another idea that I suspect—and hope—is on the way out is the insistence on "authenticity."
You can tie yourself in knots trying to source the ingredients to make the most supposedly authentic version of a particular dish. Is the olive oil in your Ligurian pesto the right one? Does your paella contain the required snails? The truth, however, is that no recipe is ever truly authentic. A dish is always borrowed or tweaked from somewhere else, and that is no bad thing.
A couple of years ago, the Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi, who is famous for his inventive flavors, was vilified by readers on the Guardian website for publishing an online recipe for Irish stew. Mr. Ottolenghi made no pretense that his stew was anything anyone would recognize in Ireland, where the original stew is nothing but mutton, potatoes, onions and water. His version—an homage to his Irish husband—contained white wine and herbs and was finished with an aromatic paste of orange zest, garlic and parsley. He saw these addition as a way to adapt Irish stew to his own palate. But to the chef's online critics, these tasty seasonings, especially the orange zest, were a violation of the holy memory of the original Irish stew.
The cult of authenticity is based on the idea that recipes are suspended in time and place, like berries in an old-fashioned Jell-O mold. Yet since the discovery of fire, every generation of cooks has rewritten the rule book of cooking, depending on the ingredients and resources available and the tastes of the times. Modern apples tend to be sweeter than older varieties, so to make an apple pie that tastes authentically like one of the 1950s, you would need to use less sugar.
Even in Ireland, stew is evolving. I recently ate the best Irish stew of my life at a restaurant in Galway run by a brilliant chef from New Zealand named Jess Murphy. In place of potatoes, Ms. Murphy uses an assortment of local root vegetables and seasons the broth with lovage, an herb that tastes like celery, only earthier. Alongside the stew was a damp dark soda bread and superb Irish butter.
If her Irish customers were offended by her updated stew, they showed no sign of it. Sipping the delicious lovage-scented broth, it suddenly occurred to me that it's more respectful to a dish to cook it and keep it alive than it is to insist on making it the exact same way it happened to be made a hundred years ago.
"Who cares if it's authentic, so long as it tastes good?" Mr. Ottolenghi remarked at London's National Theatre in London in August, talking about the Irish stew affair. I was on stage with him and cookery writer Nigella Lawson, talking about "food and identity." Both said that when it comes to food, authenticity is not as important as cooking something authentically delicious. Ms. Lawson said she believed it was important to respect the origins of a recipe and to acknowledge its roots but also to recognize that cooking traditions are always changing.
It's hard enough making time for cooking in the modern world without giving yourself the added burden of authenticity to live up to. A few months ago, the journalist Stephen S. Hall traveled to the city of Amatrice in the Lazio region of Italy for the New York Times, in search of the "real" pasta all'Amatriciana—the deliciously comforting sauce of tomatoes and cured pork. What he discovered was that he had been cooking his favorite pasta dish "wrong" for the past 40 years.
Following Marcella Hazan's classic recipe, Mr. Hall had always made his Amatriciana with pancetta, butter and onions (a recipe that I can confirm is pure comfort), yet he found that in Amatrice, onions and butter were never added to the dish. The true Amatriciana, he found, contained only tomato sauce, pecorino and guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), which has a sweeter taste than pancetta. Locals were horrified when he confessed to using pancetta in his Amatriciana.
Is using pancetta instead of guanciale really such a crime? The thing that gets missed by those who cling to the idea of authentic food is that when you change the context of the cooking, you change the meaning. In Amatrice, guanciale is used in pasta dishes because it is a normal, everyday item. Outside of Italy, as Marcella Hazan wrote, "pork jowl is hard to get," and therefore it's a reasonable choice—and true to the original spirit of the dish—to substitute something that's easier to find.
I am not suggesting for a moment that we should pay no regard to the origin of dishes. A British chain, Marks and Spencer, recently caused offense by selling a vegan wrap sandwich that was labeled as biryani—biryani being a noble and festive Indian rice dish. This wasn't so much an adaptation as an outright piece of misdescription.
But when it comes to authenticity there are bigger fish to fry than whether you used exactly the right variety of wine in your osso bucco. Our stores are full of items that claim to be something they are not. We are sold lemonade that contains no lemons and berry-flavor breakfast cereals that never saw a piece of fruit. A 2010-2012 report on seafood fraud by the nonprofit Oceana found that much of the fish for sale in the U.S. was mislabeled. The group found, for instance, that 87% of the "snapper'' on sale was mislabeled (it was mostly tilapia).
Rather than devoting so much of our energy and attention to searching for the authentic, we could ask a simpler question of our food. Is it real?

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- "The Morning Show" started life as a behind-the-scenes peek at a slice of network TV as familiar and routine as a wake-up cup of coffee. Then shocking revelations of sexual misconduct engulfed NBC's "Today" and beyond, and the story changed.

The 10-part drama series, part of the first wave of shows launching the Apple TV Plus streaming service Nov. 1, expanded its original focus on women's role in media to include the repercussions of workplace bad behavior. It all plays out in the lucrative, hypercompetitive world of A.M. news-and-fluff programming.

"When the Me Too movement happened it was really hard to ignore, nor would we want to ignore it. We would be negligent," said Mimi Leder, an executive producer and director for "The Morning Show."

Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon lead the cast that includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell and Desean Terry. Aniston plays Alex, the long-reigning queen of the now-slumping "Morning Show," and Witherspoon is Bradley, an outspoken TV reporter with a shaky job history who lands hard on Alex's turf.

But Alex's longtime co-anchor Mitch (Carell) has already wreaked havoc. The drama opens with him fired by network UBA for multiple instances of alleged misconduct, evoking Matt Lauer's dismissal from "Today." Mitch's banishment creates career and psychological upheaval for Alex and opportunity for those waiting in the wings for their shot at network glory.

Among them is Daniel (Terry), an African-American co-anchor who chafes at what he considers pressure to downplay his ethnicity and hopes the top anchor job will be his reward. There are impressive displays of ambition and plot twists galore in the three episodes Apple made available of the glossy, expensive-looking drama that's debuting three episodes on Nov. 1. Remaining episodes will be released consecutively on Fridays.

Apple TV Plus costs $4.99 a month after a seven-day free trial, and a subscription can be shared with up to six family members. The streaming service is free for a year to buyers of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV box.

Alex's somber on-air response to the scandal evokes memories of Samantha Guthrie and Hoda Kotb telling "Today" viewers about Lauer's November 2017 firing for what NBC called "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace." The fallout has yet to subside: co-anchors Guthrie and Kotb returned to the subject of Lauer earlier this month after further allegations against him emerged in Ronan Farrow's new book, "Catch and Kill."

Series executive producer Michael Ellenberg began work on what became "The Morning Show" before #MeToo, saying he was intrigued by "what it means to be a woman in media" and specifically a woman with power in the morning network realm. He found the "authentic, precise" details he needed in journalist Brian Stelter's 2013 nonfiction book, "Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV."

Ellenberg optioned the book, Aniston and Witherspoon were attached and Kerry Ehrin ("Friday Night Lights," ‘'Bates Motel") was brought in as writer and showrunner (Stelter, a former reporter with The New York Times and now with CNN, is a consultant-writer). Leder said the drama from a nearly all-female slate of executive producers -- including Aniston and Reese -- is at its core about the relationship between Alex and Bradley.

The two are "colliding at a certain point in their lives," Leder said, with Alex at "a plateau where ageism is starting to hit, and Bradley being this character who's trying to make her mark, and what can these two women give each other?"

Texto completo: In announcing he would not, after all, award the 2020 summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations to his own resort in Florida, President Donald Trump tweeted, “I thought I was doing something very good for our Country,” and disparaged the “Crazed and Irrational Hostility” of his critics.
Even in backing down, Trump rejects any expectation that he should separate his public office from his business interests. Awarding himself the G-7 summit was especially audacious not least because in 2016, the G-7 committed to fighting corruption specifically in government contracts. But this brazen attempt at self-dealing was consistent with the Trump administration’s long record of retreating from America’s bipartisan role as a leader in the fight against global corruption.
Trump retreat from corruption fight
The United States has long understood that corruption has profoundly corrosive and transnational ripple effects. Where there is impunity for official corruption, government itself becomes a means for the elite to enrich itself and silence its critics. Corruption allowed to fester breeds poverty, violence and instability that can have far reaching consequences. Human Rights Watch, the World Bank and others have documented how corruption often disproportionately harms the poor, denying them access to basic rights such as health, education and fair trials.
Recognizing this, the United States has pioneered groundbreaking efforts to curb corruption through its laws, enforcement and diplomacy. When the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibited U. S. companies from bribing foreign officials in 1977, no other country had a similar law, but similar laws have since been enacted by the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, France and many other countries.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded oil, gas and mining companies to publish what they pay to foreign governments, a provision that inspired copycat laws in Canada, the European Union and Norway.
Also in 2010, the Department of Justice established an innovative kleptocracy asset recovery initiative, dedicated to seizing illicit funds laundered in the United States and returning them for the benefit of the public from whom they were stolen.
The United States, however, has retreated from this role under Trump, who once disparaged the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as “ridiculous” and a “terrible law. ” The Dodd-Frank transparency provision hasn’t yet gone into effect because Congress, with Trump’s support, repealed the federal rule creating the disclosure requirement and has yet to propose a replacement.
The Trump administration also withdrew the United States from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global standard for transparency around natural resources.
Ukraine to Guatemala, walking away
But it’s more than that. The Trump administration sought to cut funding for foreign anti-corruption programs, including in Ukraine. And it has noticeably demurred using its formidable diplomatic leverage to combat corruption in places where America's voice was once decisive. There is perhaps no better example of this transformation and its enormous stakes for the rights of ordinary citizens than Guatemala.
Endemic corruption in Guatemala has allowed organized crime to thrive, fueling grave abuses. Yet the Trump administration helped strangle a fledgling anti-corruption commission in Guatemala, which shuttered its doors in September. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known as CICIG, was backed by the United Nations and founded in 2007 with the strong support of President George W. Bush. The United States, its top donor, had given it $44 million.
Don't praise Trump for G-7 reversal: It was an intolerable abuse of power.
In 2015, when then-President Otto Pérez Molina threatened to end CICIG’s mandate, he said he reversed course because the Obama administration made its continuation “practically a condition” for U. S. aid. Only months later, Pérez Molina was forced to resign after a CICIG investigation connected him to massive corruption.
In sharp contrast, the Trump administration has stood by silently since Guatemala’s latest president, Jimmy Morales, whom CICIG has also accused of corruption, announced last year that he would not extend the commission’s mandate.
Trump is role model for corruption
Beyond that, Trump’s flagrant self-dealing, by echoing the language of kleptocrats, is itself a major blow to the fight against global corruption. Soon after he was elected, he told The New York Times he sees no problem pursuing his business interests during official meetings. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he said.
He has also refused to release his tax returns or divest from his complex web of international businesses, as all modern U. S. presidents have done. (He promised to put his businesses in a revocable trust run by his sons, although it would do little to resolve the risk of conflict of interest, and no trust agreement has been made public. ) Since then, he has regularly used the presidency in ways that benefit his businesses — for example, making over 360 visits to properties he owns at enormous public expense.
Trump's sleaze: Grifters, women, trampling Constitution and now G-7 at Doral
In pursuing these open conflicts of interest, Trump gives cover to other kleptocrats who loot public funds. In one 2011 case, the Justice Department's anti-kleptocracy unit seized a private plane, California mansion and other assets belonging to Teodorin Obiang, son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, where I have spent years documenting corruption and its contributions to the dire state of health, education and human rights. Justice uncovered evidence detailing how officials, including the president’s son, siphoned off millions in government funds by awarding enormous contracts to companies they own.
Obiang’s defense was that he did not break any laws because conflict of interest rules don’t apply to senior officials. Justice vigorously protested this argument and ultimately settled the case for $30 million, which the agency must now repatriate for the benefit of ordinary Equatorial Guineans.
Trump backed away from his most audacious attempt at self-dealing in the face of criticism from Republicans, but they were merely treating a symptom. They should return to the fight against corruption at home and abroad.

The Democrats' Spooky Politics

Texto completo: It was this weekend in 2012 that I went to a Halloween party wearing a quite realistic-looking Joe Biden mask. After about an hour, people said it was too spooky and asked me to take it off. When the Obama presidency ended, I threw the Biden mask away, assuming I'd never need it again. Wishful thinking is always a mistake.
With Halloween in the air, it's the right moment to discuss the central role played in presidential politics by bogeymen -- creatures conjured to distract and scare the citizenry. In politics, the bogeyman is always just around the corner. For John F. Kennedy it was "the missile gap"; for Barack Obama, "the wealthiest"; and for Donald Trump, criminals pouring across "the border."
Naturally, the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination needed a bogeyman, and they have created one even scarier than the Trump monster. It's them -- "corporations!" At their recent presidential debate, one candidate after another claimed corporations were wrecking the country.
Elizabeth Warren, who knows a thing or two about scaring people: "They have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line." And by the way, "I have a plan." Yikes.
Cory Booker ranted about "corporate tax incentives," and Amy Klobuchar wants a rollback of "what we did with the corporate tax rate." Beto O'Rourke somehow related a woman he said was working four jobs with "some of these corporations," andTom Steyer, billionaire, said we have to "break the power of these corporations."
Finally Joe Biden, seeing where this was going, invoked the "corporate greed" of companies that are "not investing in our employees."
Politics, as has been proved lately, can get crude, and one understands why candidates play the race card, the class-warfare card or the anti-immigrant card. But how has the Democratic Party arrived en masse at playing the anti-corporation card?
If one sits through any of these three-hour-long Democratic debates or their climate and LGBTQ town halls, it's hard not to notice that there is an 800-pound elephant in the room that none of them (including the moderators) want to talk about -- the American economy in the here and now.
Unless the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is another front for Donald Trump, the reality of historically high job creation and rising wages for people regardless of income level, race, sex or sexual orientation has become impossible not to notice.
Even the New York Times recently admitted the jobs boom was forcing "corporations" to dig deeper for workers: "With the national unemployment rate now flirting with a 50-year low," it noted that companies are offering work-from-home options to parents, accommodating employees with disabilities, reducing educational requirements and waiving criminal background checks.
This 50-year unemployment low -- and the self-respect and sense of personal possibility that comes with it -- didn't just happen. It is the explicit result of Congress and President Trump redeploying two proven pillars of Reaganomics. They dropped the tax rate on -- yes -- "corporations" to 21% from its investment-killing decades at 35%, and he unwound a waaay-overboard Obama regulatory regime that was imposed on virtually every private-sector producer in the U.S. economy.
You'd have to be obtuse not to recognize the historic burst of individual economic opportunity happening now. The wonder wasn't so much the economic revival this produced but the astonishing scope of the Trump boom.
The Democratic presidential candidates aren't talking about the real economy because most of them don't understand it. The Democratic Party's historic link to the real economy was private-sector labor unions affiliated with industries such as steel, mining and cars. With the decline of those unions, the Democrats have become an almost wholly public-sector party, for which the private economy, which employs millions of workers, has become a distant planet whose only function is to send the oxygen of tax revenue. Which is why Democrats propose unpriceable ideas like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Which is why so many blue-collar workers in 2016 managed to identify their lot with an unapologetic billionaire businessman.
This is the real reason a moderate and totally embedded private-sector Democratic figure such as Mike Bloomberg isn't likely to run. The party, captured by cotton-candy socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has deserted him. The real-world disconnect even got to primo Never-Trumper Alec Baldwin, who recently lamented the attacks on "a country built on both freedoms and commerce." Commerce? What's that?
The economy slowed to a 1.9% growth rate in the third quarter as business investment fell beneath the enduring weight of the Trump tariffs, which could yet take some sheen off his accomplishment. But come the general-election debates next year, Mr. Trump will relentlessly pound his opponent with the fact of real work created for real people. Whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, they're going to need a better bogeyman to compete than corporate greed.

Texto completo: Jho Low, the businessman-turned-fugitive accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar fraud involving Malaysia's sovereign-wealth fund, agreed to forfeit more than $700 million in assets U.S. authorities sought to seize, according to a settlement filed Wednesday.
Mr. Low will give up assets that include real estate, a luxury yacht and a private jet, according to the settlement, which doesn't resolve the criminal cases against the Malaysian businessman or include any admission of wrongdoing by him.
Mr. Low remains a fugitive from the U.S. criminal justice system and is believed to be in China or under Chinese protection elsewhere in the world.
In a statement, Mr. Low admitted no wrongdoing and called the agreement "a successful and satisfactory result."
Mr. Low still faces criminal cases in New York and Washington that accuse him of conspiring to launder billions of dollars in proceeds from the fraud and bribing Malaysian government officials.
The settlement resolves a set of civil-forfeiture suits the U.S. has filed to recover property valued at more than $1 billion, including van Gogh and Monet paintings and luxury real estate in New York and Los Angeles. Prosecutors alleged that the assets were obtained using funds Mr. Low embezzled from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB.
The scandal is believed to be one of the largest financial frauds in history, and has resulted in the downfall of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Documents From Boeing Show Worry Over Safety

Texto completo: The chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, faced a second day of questions from Congress over the 737 Max crashes.
One Boeing employee worried the 737 Max might be "vulnerable." A company document said if pilots didn't respond to a new automated system within seconds it would be "catastrophic." A plan to include an alert for the system, known as MCAS, was considered but scrapped.
The new revelations about how Boeing wrestled with the safety questions surrounding the new system on its best-selling plane came at a congressional hearing on Wednesday in Washington, adding to evidence that the company was aware of concerns about the plane's safety before two crashes that left 346 people dead.
Taken together with emails released this month showing that a top Boeing pilot was having trouble with the new system in the simulator before the plane was complete, the documents paint a fuller picture of Boeing employees' developing and at times raising concerns about MCAS.
The company, facing intense competitive pressure from its rival Airbus, ultimately determined the system was safe to install in the Max. And it continued to defend the safety of the plane after the accidents.
The latest documents were made public at a hearing of the House transportation committee that lasted more than five hours. Committee members took turns grilling Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, interspersing calls for his resignation with slides depicting damning internal company documents questioning the safety of the automated system.
In one partly redacted email from 2015, years before the plane was certified, a Boeing employee questioned whether the system was vulnerable to malfunctioning if a single sensor failed. Investigators believe that is what happened in both doomed flights, a Lion Air flight that crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018 and another 737 Max that went down in Ethiopia in March.
The new documents again raise the question of why Boeing installed MCAS in the Max after making it more powerful and less reliable. Boeing played down the risks of the system to the Federal Aviation Administration during the development of the plane and asked the F.A.A. for permission to remove mention of it from the pilot's manual. Pilots were not notified about MCAS until after the first crash.
Two days after the accident in Ethiopia on March 10, Mr. Muilenburg called President Trump and insisted the Max was safe. The United States grounded the plane the next day, however, after most other regulators around the world had already done so.
Boeing's actions were "inexplicable, inexcusable and as far as I know unprecedented in the history of passenger aviation," said Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the committee.
The 737 Max remains grounded, and the crisis has cost Boeing more than $ 8 billion and roiled the broader aviation industry.
The hearing was the second day in a row that Mr. Muilenburg had faced irate lawmakers, following an appearance at the Senate commerce committee on Tuesday where he acknowledged that he was aware of the emails from the pilot before the second crash.
"If we knew then what we know now we would have grounded right after the first accident," Mr. Muilenburg said during Wednesday's hearing.
Mr. DeFazio displayed an image of an early design for a cockpit indicator that would have notified pilots of an MCAS malfunction, a feature that never appeared on the plane. Another document showed that in June 2018, months before the Lion Air crash, an internal Boeing document said that if pilots took 10 seconds to respond once MCAS was activated, the result could be "catastrophic."
The House hearing was longer, more sprawling in scope and, at times, more charged than the Senate's. Multiple representatives criticized Mr. Muilenburg's salary -- he received a $ 23.4 million pay package last year -- and demanded that he resign. Some of his answers brought groans or exclamations from victims' family members in attendance.
"What does accountability mean?" Representative Stephen Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, asked Mr. Muilenburg at one point in a raised voice. "Are you taking a cut in pay? Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem? These people's relatives are not coming back. They're gone. Your salary is still on."
Mr. Muilenburg's face reddened, as he noted that the board determines his pay.
The barrage of questions seemed to strike a chord with the cluster of more than a dozen victims' family members gathered in a corner of the hearing room. Chris and Clariss Moore, the parents of Danielle Moore, who died in the Ethiopia crash, began to cry and a man brought over tissues.
"Mr. Muilenburg, if you had an ounce of integrity, you would know that the right thing to do is to step down," Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Democrat of Florida, said later.
Mr. Muilenburg repeatedly said he was "accountable" for the failures that led to the two crashes, but declined to resign and said he had not offered the board his resignation. (This month, the board stripped him of his chairman title.) He frequently mentioned that he grew up on a farm in Iowa, and said that his father taught him "you don't run away from challenges."
Lawmakers were unmoved by his biography. "You're no longer an Iowa farm boy," Mr. DeFazio said. "You are the C.E.O. of the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world."
Near the end of the hearing, Mr. Muilenburg said he did not expect to receive a bonus this year, after receiving a $ 13 million bonus last year. "I'm anticipating that this year's annual bonus cycle will be zero," he said.
Other documents made public by lawmakers on Wednesday raised questions about why the F.A.A. did not ground the Max after the first crash. In December, after the first accident, Boeing made a presentation to the F.A.A. in which it noted that the failure of one sensor on the outside of the plane could be "catastrophic." In both crashes, investigators believe a single sensor malfunctioned, triggering MCAS and sending the planes into nose dives.
At another point, Representative Albio Sires, Democrat of New Jersey, read from an email he said was sent to the head of the 737 program in 2018, from a Boeing employee complaining of fatigue and safety concerns on the production line. Shortly after the second crash, The New York Times reported on the intense pressure to produce the Max.
"Our work force is exhausted," the employee wrote. "Fatigued employees make mistakes.
"Frankly right now all my internal warning bells are going off," the email continued. "And for the first time in my life, I'm sorry to say that I'm hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane."
Several representatives also presented evidence they said showed that Boeing was consumed with minimizing pilot training for the Max, leading them to play down the importance of the new system and not include it in pilot manuals. Mr. DeFazio confirmed that Boeing had offered Southwest Airlines a $ 1 million discount per plane if the Max required simulator training, and displayed a slide from an internal presentation playing up the fact that the Max would not require simulator training.
Representatives also questioned Mr. Muilenburg on messages that Mark Forkner, the plane's chief technical pilot, sent to a colleague, Patrik Gustavsson, during the plane's development. In the messages, which were made public this month, Mr. Forkner said that he was having trouble with MCAS during simulator training, and had unintentionally lied to regulators.
Mr. Gustavsson was removed from certification work at Boeing in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Mr. Muilenburg also faced sharp criticism from lawmakers about other Boeing airplanes facing challenges, including the 787 Dreamliner, which is plagued with production problems, and the KC-46, a long-delayed military refueling tanker.
Representative John Garamendi, Democrat of California, accused Mr. Muilenburg of running a company that was relentlessly focused on the bottom line.
"Three of your principal product lines, the 737 Max, the KC-46 and the Dreamliner all have quality issues," he said. "I would posit the reality that you are pushing profits over quality and safety."
After the hearing, Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Stumo was killed in the Ethiopian crash, confronted Mr. Muilenburg for the second day in a row and told him to resign.
"You talked about Iowa just like one too many times," she told Mr. Muilenburg, who listened to Ms. Milleron, his hands clasped. "Go back to the farm. Go back to Iowa."

Texto completo: It was this weekend in 2012 that I went to a Halloween party wearing a quite realistic-looking Joe Biden mask. After about an hour, people said it was too spooky and asked me to take it off. When the Obama presidency ended, I threw the Biden mask away, assuming I'd never need it again. Wishful thinking is always a mistake.
With Halloween in the air, it's the right moment to discuss the central role played in presidential politics by bogeymen—creatures conjured to distract and scare the citizenry. In politics, the bogeyman is always just around the corner. For John F. Kennedy it was "the missile gap"; for Barack Obama, "the wealthiest"; and for Donald Trump, criminals pouring across "the border."
Naturally, the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination needed a bogeyman, and they have created one even scarier than the Trump monster. It's them—"corporations!" At their recent presidential debate, one candidate after another claimed corporations were wrecking the country.
Elizabeth Warren, who knows a thing or two about scaring people: "They have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line." And by the way, "I have a plan." Yikes.
Cory Booker ranted about "corporate tax incentives," and Amy Klobuchar wants a rollback of "what we did with the corporate tax rate." Beto O'Rourke somehow related a woman he said was working four jobs with "some of these corporations," and Tom Steyer, billionaire, said we have to "break the power of these corporations."
Finally Joe Biden, seeing where this was going, invoked the "corporate greed" of companies that are "not investing in our employees."
Politics, as has been proved lately, can get crude, and one understands why candidates play the race card, the class-warfare card or the anti-immigrant card. But how has the Democratic Party arrived en masse at playing the anti-corporation card?
If one sits through any of these three-hour-long Democratic debates or their climate and LGBTQ town halls, it's hard not to notice that there is an 800-pound elephant in the room that none of them (including the moderators) want to talk about—the American economy in the here and now.
Unless the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is another front for Donald Trump, the reality of historically high job creation and rising wages for people regardless of income level, race, sex or sexual orientation has become impossible not to notice.
Even the New York Times recently admitted the jobs boom was forcing "corporations" to dig deeper for workers: "With the national unemployment rate now flirting with a 50-year low," it noted that companies are offering work-from-home options to parents, accommodating employees with disabilities, reducing educational requirements and waiving criminal background checks.
This 50-year unemployment low—and the self-respect and sense of personal possibility that comes with it—didn't just happen. It is the explicit result of Congress and President Trump redeploying two proven pillars of Reaganomics. They dropped the tax rate on—yes—"corporations" to 21% from its investment-killing decades at 35%, and he unwound a waaay-overboard Obama regulatory regime that was imposed on virtually every private-sector producer in the U.S. economy.
You'd have to be obtuse not to recognize the historic burst of individual economic opportunity happening now. The wonder wasn't so much the economic revival this produced but the astonishing scope of the Trump boom.
The Democratic presidential candidates aren't talking about the real economy because most of them don't understand it. The Democratic Party's historic link to the real economy was private-sector labor unions affiliated with industries such as steel, mining and cars. With the decline of those unions, the Democrats have become an almost wholly public-sector party, for which the private economy, which employs millions of workers, has become a distant planet whose only function is to send the oxygen of tax revenue. Which is why Democrats propose unpriceable ideas like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Which is why so many blue-collar workers in 2016 managed to identify their lot with an unapologetic billionaire businessman.
This is the real reason a moderate and totally embedded private-sector Democratic figure such as Mike Bloomberg isn't likely to run. The party, captured by cotton-candy socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has deserted him. The real-world disconnect even got to primo Never-Trumper Alec Baldwin, who recently lamented the attacks on "a country built on both freedoms and commerce." Commerce? What's that?
The economy slowed to a 1.9% growth rate in the third quarter as business investment fell beneath the enduring weight of the Trump tariffs, which could yet take some sheen off his accomplishment. But come the general-election debates next year, Mr. Trump will relentlessly pound his opponent with the fact of real work created for real people. Whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, they're going to need a better bogeyman to compete than corporate greed.

Texto completo: At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance - the women's and the author's - under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority - over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer - made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story - and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed - we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

U.S. News: Parties Spar Over Impeachment Witness

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Testimony of a White House national security official turned combative Tuesday as Democrats accused Republicans of trying to unmask the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, while the GOP lawmakers argued theirs was a legitimate line of questioning.
The appearance by Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a White House Ukraine expert who testified that he expressed alarm at a U.S. pressure campaign on Ukraine's president over the summer, spurred Mr. Trump and his allies to attack his background and credentials, which drew some pushback from Republicans.
Meanwhile, House Democrats released a resolution Tuesday laying out how public hearings in their impeachment investigation will be conducted, ahead of an expected vote later this week.
Democrats after Col. Vindman's hearing called the GOP attempt to ferret out details on the whistleblower potentially dangerous. While the identity of the person remains publicly unknown, the legal team representing him has received multiple death threats that have led to at least one law-enforcement investigation, according to people close to the legal team, as well as other abusive communications.
None of the threats thus far have appeared to be credible, the people said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at that whistleblower, known to be a Central Intelligence Agency officer, while pushing for the person's identity to be revealed. "Where's the Whistleblower?" Mr. Trump asked on Twitter Tuesday. Since the whistleblower's account was released more than a month ago, several Trump diplomats and other witnesses have testified, backing up many of the allegations about the pressure campaign on Ukraine while aid to the country was being held up.
Col. Vindman's hearing occurred behind closed doors, and he said in his prepared testimony that he isn't the whistleblower and doesn't know who it is, but Democrats said Republican questioning was aimed at the person's identity.
"Most of their hour seemed to have been spent trying to backdoor him into narrowing down, for them, who the whistleblower is," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) said.
In a July call, Mr. Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations into matters related to the 2016 election and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Those requests, and the temporary hold on aid to Ukraine, are at the center of House Democrats' impeachment probe. Mr. Trump has defended the call as appropriate.
Col. Vindman, who listened in on the call, testified that he was concerned because he didn't think it was appropriate to ask another country to investigate a U.S. citizen.
Republicans complained that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) had blocked their questioning over whom Col. Vindman had spoken to about his concerns.
The rough transcript of the call released by the White House contained missing words and phrases, Col. Vindman told investigators. He testified that he tried to restore those words but wasn't successful, according to people familiar with the testimony. The people added it wasn't clear how significant or intentional the omissions were. The New York Times earlier reported the testimony regarding the omissions.
The substance of Col. Vindman's testimony was at times overshadowed as Mr. Trump and his defenders repeated a pattern of attacking those who come forward in the inquiry.
In separate interviews on CNN and Fox News, respectively, Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman, and John Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration official, appeared to suggest that Col. Vindman had divided loyalties because he was born in Ukraine. The Iraq war veteran, who was awarded a Purple Heart, migrated to the U.S. with his family when he was young.
Both Messrs. Duffy and Yoo subsequently sought to walk back their comments.
The House Democratic resolution on the inquiry sets equal time for questioning for both the majority and minority party, of up to 45 minutes per side, and allows Republicans to request witnesses, subject to Democratic approval. It also gives the president or his counsel an opportunity to participate in Judiciary Committee hearings, including the ability to cross-examine witnesses.
A vote on the resolution is expected on Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House is weighing legal options that could allow President Trump to appoint Ken Cuccinelli as the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House personnel chief told Mr. Trump in a meeting last week that his top choices for the job -- Mr. Cuccinelli, acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection -- are both ineligible under a federal statute governing vacancies, according to an opinion by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Now, the White House is considering a plan allowing the administration to change the line of succession at the department to bypass the vacancies statute and appoint Mr. Cuccinelli or another pick. White House officials have asked the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel if such a plan is legal, one of the people familiar with the plan said.
Mr. Trump has told allies that he wants Mr. Cuccinelli to lead the department.
Acting Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan submitted his resignation earlier this month and has told associates his last day will be Thursday.
Officials cautioned that Mr. Trump hasn't made a final decision about whom he will choose to lead the department, or whether to pursue the plan. The New York Times earlier reported that the White House was considering the plan. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- WhatsApp sued the Israeli cybersurveillance firm NSO Group in federal court on Tuesday, claiming the company's spy technology was used on the popular messaging service in a wide-ranging campaign targeting journalists and human-rights activists.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, claimed in the lawsuit that an NSO Group program that was intended to piggyback on WhatsApp was used to spy on more than 1,400 people in 20 countries.
The lawsuit did not say who was using NSO Group technology to target WhatsApp users. But the area codes for a number of phones that had been attacked indicated a focus on people in Mexico, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
The filing of the lawsuit, believed to be the first by a tech company against a for-profit digital surveillance company, could be the "beginning of the end" of the rapid and largely unregulated adoption of these surveillance technologies, said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab.
WhatsApp worked closely with Citizen Lab, a research group affiliated with the University of Toronto that aids victims of digital surveillance, in its investigation of the attacks, which took place from April to May.
The messaging service said the victims included 100 journalists, prominent female leaders, several people who had been targeted with unsuccessful assassination attempts, political dissidents and human rights activists -- as well as their families.
The suit was filed in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California. NSO Group, which sells its surveillance technology to governments all over the world, said in a statement Tuesday that it disputed the claims in the WhatsApp lawsuit in the "strongest possible terms" and "will vigorously fight them."
NSO Group added that its technology was used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies in lawful antiterrorism efforts and crime-fighting, and it "has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years."
The investigation started after Citizen Lab charged that NSO Group's technology had been used to exploit a WhatsApp security hole to hack the phone of a London lawyer. The hole was patched in May.
The lawyer had represented several plaintiffs in lawsuits that accused NSO Group of providing tools to hack the phones of a Saudi Arabian dissident living in Canada, a Qatari citizen and a group of Mexican journalists and activists. He contacted Citizen Lab.
The researchers said they discovered that NSO technology left digital crumbs that helped them uncover the spy campaign. The weakness: Whoever was using the NSO Group hacking tools had to place a WhatsApp call to their target. Even if the target did not pick up the phone, NSO's technology would become embedded in the phone and provide access to all of its contents.
The missed calls, however, tipped off the lawyer, he told The New York Times.
After WhatsApp patched the security hole, NSO employees lamented that the company closed off a major espionage channel. An NSO employee even told a WhatsApp employee in a message: "You just closed our biggest remote for cellular," according to the WhatsApp complaint.
Citizen Lab and WhatsApp would not name the individuals targeted, citing privacy policies.
WhatsApp said in a statement that it was informing affected customers with special WhatsApp messages. The company is seeking a permanent injunction to block NSO from its service, and called on lawmakers to ban the use of cyberweapons like those sold by NSO Group to governments.
"This should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all internet users," Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, wrote in an opinion article in The Washington Post on Tuesday. "Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk."
Mr. Cathcart also urged technology firms to join a call from the United Nations special rapporteur, David Kaye, for an immediate moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of dangerous spyware.
NSO Group is one of dozens of digital spy outfits that provide technology to track everything a target does on a smartphone. Its spyware allows governments to track the location, communications, contacts and web activities of targets. But such access can be easily abused.
NSO Group has said in the past that it limits the sale of hacking tools to governments with poor human-rights records, but it has little insight into how its tools are used once they are in government hands. The company has said it only learns and investigates cases of abuse when they surface in the media.
NSO Group's technology has repeatedly been discovered on the phones of civilians.
In 2017, The Times helped uncover the use of NSO spyware on journalists, dissidents and consumer rights activists in Mexico. Since then, the spyware has been uncovered on the phone of the wife of a murdered Mexican journalist and, last year, on the phone of a close confidant of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist whose murder was linked by United States intelligence services to the Saudi Arabian government.
The WhatsApp complaint that was filed on Tuesday claims that NSO Group is closer to the deployment of its spyware than it portrays to the public. WhatsApp traced several servers that deployed NSO's spyware back to internet addresses operated directly by NSO Group. The company leased servers -- including servers in the United States -- from Amazon and two other cloud services called Choopa and Quadranet, to help deploy its spyware, the lawsuit said.
Amazon did not return a request for comment.
Since NSO Group was founded in 2011, its spy technology, called Pegasus, has become the preferred mobile spy tool of many governments. An early NSO commercial proposal leaked to The Times claimed Pegasus could overcome encryption to grant "unlimited access" to everything on a target's mobile device.
"Pegasus silently deploys invisible software on the target device," the company's early pitch read. "Installation is performed remotely over-the-air, does not require any action from or engagement with the target and leaves no trace whatsoever on the device."
For years, commercial spyware makers have been unregulated, in part because governments are the clients.
"They get close to governments and when those governments do bad things with their products, commercial spyware companies can claim it's not their fault," said Mr. Scott-Railton, of Citizen Lab.
Earlier this year, Novalpina Capital, a private equity firm, acquired a stake in NSO Group. The firm has been trying to help NSO Group polish its image, highlighting the use of its technology in notable crime fighting, like the arrest of Joaquín Guzmán, the drug cartel leader known as El Chapo.
Stephen Peel, Novalpina Capital's founding partner, said in a letter to human rights groups that the company was determined to make sure its technology was used for "the prevention of harm to fundamental human rights arising from terrorism and serious crime," and not abused.
But Citizen Lab said in a statement that it had repeatedly raised questions to Novalpina about whether its public statements about human rights compliance made any difference, given how frequently NSO's spyware had been abused.

Texto completo: A popular sports website was told to stick to sports -- and staff members revolted.
Deadspin, a sister site to Gizmodo and Jezebel, is the latest blog run by G/O Media involved in an escalating conflict with its new owner, Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm based in Boston.
When a memo circulated to Deadspin staff on Monday about the site's editorial direction was met with derision, management shot back. The site's interim editor in chief, Barry Petchesky, who had worked there for 10 years, tweeted Tuesday that he had been fired for "not sticking to sports."
It comes less than two months after the site's previous editor in chief resigned.
"Sports touches on nearly every aspect of life -- from politics to business to pop culture and more," Paul Maidment, G/O Media's editorial director, said in an emailed statement Tuesday, referring to the memo he had written.
"We believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story, as long as it has something to do with sports," he added. "We are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don't agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate."
Mr. Petchesky did not reply to a request for comment.
Deadspin -- at one time the sports equivalent of Gawker -- is known for its irreverence, with a motto promising: "Sports News Without Access, Fear, or Discretion." It was acquired in April from Univision when it was part of Gizmodo Media Group. The bundle of sites was then renamed G/O Media.
Though sports has been Deadspin's focus since its beginning, the site has also delved into political coverage and was praised for its 2014 analysis of "Gamergate," one of the first exhaustive looks at the issue of sexism and harassment in the world of video games. Indeed, it would have been hard for reporters to avoid any mention of politics when covering the numerous sports incidents that occurred as a response to the rise of President Trump, including the N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem and the booing of Mr. Trump at a World Series game on Sunday night.
"To create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports," Mr. Maidment said in the memo, which has been viewed by The New York Times.
The memo, which was first reported by The Daily Beast, prompted a puckish response from Deadspin's staff members Tuesday: They only published articles having little or nothing to do with sports, including a post about a pumpkin thief in Washington, another discussing the virtues and demerits of various wedding dress codes (keep it simple, the author urges) and a resurfaced long-form article on an obscure German actor who played a villain in "Ghostbusters II."
The sole exception was a post about the booing of Trump. In his memo, Mr. Maidment allowed that "where such subjects" like culture, business and politics "touch on sports, they are fair game for Deadspin."
"Where they do not," he added, "they are not."
By late afternoon, the Deadspin home page returned to topical sports stories: the World Series game on Tuesday night and N.F.L. head coaches. "Deadspin staffers had nothing to do with the changes on the front page," the staff's union said in a tweet.
In fact, Mr. Maidment assumed direct control of Deadspin on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. G/O Media has been looking for a new full-time editor in chief since its previous editor, Megan Greenwell, left in August.
There has been a broader debate in sports journalism about how much, or little, coverage there should be of politics. ESPN has publicly wrestled with a sense of journalistic obligation to acknowledge divisive events during an unusually polarizing moment in American life, while balancing it against many fans' desire for sports to serve as a welcoming refuge from the wider world.
Less than a year ago, posts on The Concourse, the section of Deadspin reserved for non-sports coverage, averaged more than twice as many page views as average Deadspin posts, according to internal numbers seen by The Times. Concourse posts made up approximately one of every 50 Deadspin posts.
The dispute reflects an atmosphere between G/O Media and Deadspin that has become increasingly tense.
It is the second conflict between G/O Media management and staff this week. The sites published a post stating they had heard negative reader feedback about ads that autoplayed with volume on the websites and "are as upset with the current state of our site's user experience as you are." Management took down the post, according to the staff's union, which condemned the move.
Ms. Greenwell, Deadspin's last editor in chief, published an essay in August on her final day accusing Great Hill Partners and the chief executive of G/O Media, Jim Spanfeller, of "narrowing the scope of Deadspin's coverage" for business reasons.
Earlier this year, Deadspin and G/O Media owners were at war over an article on Mr. Spanfeller that was published by a Deadspin staff writer. Mr. Spanfeller accused writers and editors of acting in bad faith based on a list of questions submitted to him before publication and the fact that a draft of the article had been sent for legal review before he had a chance to respond. In a response, Ms. Greenwell, then the editor in chief, described the reporting process as "ongoing" and said she had planned to incorporate Mr. Spanfeller's answers in the published article.
Deadspin is not the only site under G/O Media's scrutiny. Earlier this month, it shuttered Splinter, a politics blog that was seen as the closest descendant of Gawker, the gossip site that was shut down after Terry G. Bollea, who was a professional wrestler under the name Hulk Hogan, won a $ 140 million settlement in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit financially backed by the conservative Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.

Charlie Puth Is Finally Comfortable in the Spotlight; The Grammy-nominated singer gets the call when Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne need fresh ideas. Is his next move a country album?

Texto completo: It didn't take long for 27-year-old singer Charlie Puth to make peace with the fact that his radio-friendly debut album, 2016's Nine Track Mind, was largely a misfire. "That album... It hurts me," he says. "It was very rudimentary production, but it was me. [The album] was super rushed and didn't feel like me at all."
With the gift of perfect pitch—the ability to correctly identify the exact note of any sound he hears—and a Berklee College of Music education, Puth seemed destined for more than formulaic drivel. The New Jersey native got his start posting poppy covers to YouTube and broke out with "See You Again," a duet with Wiz Khalifa in 2015. Earning three Grammy nominations for the record, Puth now says he gave too much credence to industry executives in the aftermath of his success.
"I wouldn't blame them. I had no idea where I was going, so I took a bunch of suggestions," he says.
Share Your Thoughts
What's your favorite Charlie Puth song? Why? Join the conversation below.
In a few years' time, Puth has tried to course-correct. Last year's Voicenotes was the commercial and critical project he says he wanted to make in the first place. The album was nominated for a 2019 Grammy in the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category, recognition of his technical precision as co-engineer on the project. He's released three singles over the past couple of months: "I Warned Myself," "Cheating on You" and "Mother," the latter a radio single.
Now intent on reconciling his ascent as a pop star with his ambition to be taken seriously as an artist with production chops, he's got another album's worth of material ready. Artists like Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne are calling him to work on their music, hoping his production skills will lend their new releases some fresh ideas.
"I would consider myself a record producer," he says. He adds that fellow hitmaker Benny Blanco, who has helped create songs for Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber, taught him that he should never take longer than 30 minutes creating a beat. "I don't want my songs to ever sound sloppy, I want to make sure they hit the right way. But I don't need to spend two months on a production," Puth says.
And though he's famous for big records with a light funk sheen, Puth says he wants to broaden his range—even if it means being less commercial. On a recent Instagram Live, he teased the prospect of recording a neo-soul project (he names expressive early-2000s artists Musiq Soulchild and Raphael Saadiq as his favorites), as well as a country album.
After peaking in popularity with "See You Again," the Wiz Khalifa duet that stayed No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, and its follow-up "Marvin Gaye," which verged on cliche and also charted in the top 25, Nine Track Mind was quickly forced out by his record label (Atlantic Records declined to comment on the matter). But most of the album didn't reflect his true creative spirit. He delivered a series of overly emotional public performances, which peaked with an aggressive set at the family-friendly Jingle Ball in 2016. He explained to The New York Times in 2018 that loneliness and his struggles with anxiety led to his acting out. He retreated to the studio to work on his follow up.
"Voicenotes should have been my debut album," he says. "But at the end of the day, this stuff really isn't about me. If people really want to hear 'Marvin Gaye,' and I really don't like that song at all, I'll make an arrangement to make myself tolerate it just to make people happy. I'm happy to do that."
Puth, who currently lives in Los Angeles, has taken full advantage of the creative freedom that Voicenotes, one of the best-selling pop albums of 2018, has afforded him. This year, he's popped up on a remix of 5 Seconds of Summer's "Easier" and co-wrote and co-produced Katy Perry's songs "Small Talk" and "Harleys in Hawaii." His network has expanded, too: "Mother" came about when he was in the studio working with behind-the-scenes wunderkind Andrew Watt on Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming album along with Louis Bell, Ryan Tedder and Billy Walsh. Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith, who was also in the studio playing on the Osbourne record, readily hopped on "Mother."
For now, he's focused on chasing his trio of singles with his third album. He says he has at least an album done, and that it's going to be more fun and less moody than Voicenotes, with surprising collaborations.
"What makes a good pop song is just a different way of saying something that's been said for so, so long," he says. "Bringing out an insecure feeling—we're all insecure in some way—and highlighting that and putting a beat to it and making the insecure feeling feel cool."

To better understand what is currently motivating rock star billionaires (such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Tom Steyer of Farallon), organizations like the Business Roundtable and the lower-class of just millionaires (Patriotic Millionaires) to save capitalism, it might be helpful to use an analogy.
Imagine there is an ocean liner, like the Titanic, going too fast in ice berg strewn waters surrounded by fog. The first-class passengers are enjoying every luxury, while those in steerage are miserable and sea sick in the lowest decks.
SEE ALSO: How a New AI Breakthrough Could Undermine the Finance Industry
An experienced seaman in steerage understands the ship is going too fast. However, he is not allowed out of the lower deck. His voice does not matter. In first class, some knowledgeable yachtsmen also know disaster could be imminent. Unlike the seaman, they can summon the captain and make their concerns known. They alone can prevent disaster.
Ray Dalio has written a series of articulate articles on inequity. Warren Buffett has long called for a tax structure not tilted to the ultra-wealthy. Marc Benioff just declared capitalism “dead” in a New York Times op-ed, and the Patriotic Millionaires have banded together to pay more taxes!
As the crisis of capitalism grows in America, the titans of industry, technology and finance know the ship is in danger, and they, in order to save themselves, want to change course. Not surprising, since self-preservation is near the top of Maslow’s hierarchy list. If it were only the left-wing progressives who were concerned, it would be construed as partisan politics. However, serious economists on the right, like David Stockman (former Reagan budget director), have raised the alarm. Stockman’s bestselling doorstopper of a book, The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America , is chilling reading on how off-track our economy is.
If you have not read The Communist Manifesto , you should. It’s short, more of a pamphlet than a book. However, its description of late-stage capitalism is so prescient, so accurate, as to be unnerving. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel’s depiction of the Lumpenproletariat , the impoverished class capitalism created in England’s 19th century, mirrors today’s homeless, opioid-addicted and incarcerated masses to a T. Our society’s economic inequality and resultant anger is exactly as The Manifesto chillingly predicted.
Marx’s basic belief was that capitalism would destroy itself by creating the conditions wherein workers would no longer feel they had a stake in the game and so would revolt. Marx may have been off in his prescription (communism) for what ails the world, but as an economic diagnostician, he has few equals.
As countless books, including both The Economists’ Hour and Capitalism, Alone , tell us, a myriad of familiar factors got us here: rising inequality in which the top 0.1% in America own more wealth than the bottom 90%; the loss of millions of middle-class jobs to off-shore manufacturing and automation; the relentless rise in education costs (and the resultant debtor class of millennials); the rise of corporate monopolies that force governments to give them huge tax breaks (corporate welfare); high housing costs; medical costs, including unexpected hospitalizations, leaving 43 million Americans with debt, resulting in more bankruptcies than any other factor.
The 2008 economic crisis seems to have been the breaking point. Bank bailouts plus job and home losses attributed to Wall Street greed and stupidity created a political backlash against capitalism. President Donald Trump, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have all called for an end, in one form or another, to the “rigged system.”
There is the perception that Buffett or Steyer have credibility when they call for reform. Benioff, in his op-ed, is not manning the ramparts or threatening to tear down the walls of the temple of wealth. He’s just saying he worries the country will not be safe for him, or anyone, if there is not real economic change.
Why would he and other billionaires think that? For one, they are well traveled. They’ve seen up-close what wealth disparity does to societies in Asia and Latin America, where, for example, bodyguards take elite kids to school. They’ve been greeted at five-star restaurants in Jakarta by security guards, packing serious heat. They know no one will be safe if we go down the road of $50 million mansions in the sky (Manhattan’s 57th St., anyone?) while blocks away is public housing with perennially broken elevators and urine-reeking stairwells.
Every month seems to bring a new convert to the “Billionaires for Social Justice Club.” Take the Roundtable, that citadel of corporate capitalism, which recently announced “shareholders” (i.e., stock owners) would be replaced by “stakeholders” (i.e., the larger community) as the receivers of corporate profits! In essence, the Roundtable, with a wave of a recommendation wand, just re-classified the entire S&P (70-80% of all listed companies) as “Certified B” corporations.
When the billionaires are worrying about economic injustice… it must be getting pretty bad.

Texto completo: It didn't take long for 27-year-old singer Charlie Puth to make peace with the fact that his radio-friendly debut album, 2016's Nine Track Mind, was largely a misfire. "That album... It hurts me," he says. "It was very rudimentary production, but it was me. [The album] was super rushed and didn't feel like me at all."
With the gift of perfect pitch—the ability to correctly identify the exact note of any sound he hears—and a Berklee College of Music education, Puth seemed destined for more than formulaic drivel. The New Jersey native got his start posting poppy covers to YouTube and broke out with "See You Again," a duet with Wiz Khalifa in 2015. Earning three Grammy nominations for the record, Puth now says he gave too much credence to industry executives in the aftermath of his success.
"I wouldn't blame them. I had no idea where I was going, so I took a bunch of suggestions," he says.
In a few years' time, Puth has tried to course-correct. Last year's Voicenotes was the commercial and critical project he says he wanted to make in the first place. The album was nominated for a 2019 Grammy in the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category, recognition of his technical precision as co-engineer on the project. He's released three singles over the past couple of months: "I Warned Myself," "Cheating on You" and "Mother," the latter a radio single.
Now intent on reconciling his ascent as a pop star with his ambition to be taken seriously as an artist with production chops, he's got another album's worth of material ready. Artists like Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne are calling him to work on their music, hoping his production skills will lend their new releases some fresh ideas.
"I would consider myself a record producer," he says. He adds that fellow hitmaker Benny Blanco, who has helped create songs for Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber, taught him that he should never take longer than 30 minutes creating a beat. "I don't want my songs to ever sound sloppy, I want to make sure they hit the right way. But I don't need to spend two months on a production," Puth says.
And though he's famous for big records with a light funk sheen, Puth says he wants to broaden his range—even if it means being less commercial. On a recent Instagram Live, he teased the prospect of recording a neo-soul project (he names expressive early-2000s artists Musiq Soulchild and Raphael Saadiq as his favorites), as well as a country album.
After peaking in popularity with "See You Again," the Wiz Khalifa duet that stayed No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, and its follow-up "Marvin Gaye," which verged on cliche and also charted in the top 25, Nine Track Mind was quickly forced out by his record label (Atlantic Records declined to comment on the matter). But most of the album didn't reflect his true creative spirit. He delivered a series of overly emotional public performances, which peaked with an aggressive set at the family-friendly Jingle Ball in 2016. He explained to The New York Times in 2018 that loneliness and his struggles with anxiety led to his acting out. He retreated to the studio to work on his follow up.
"Voicenotes should have been my debut album," he says. "But at the end of the day, this stuff really isn't about me. If people really want to hear 'Marvin Gaye,' and I really don't like that song at all, I'll make an arrangement to make myself tolerate it just to make people happy. I'm happy to do that."
Puth, who currently lives in Los Angeles, has taken full advantage of the creative freedom that Voicenotes, one of the best-selling pop albums of 2018, has afforded him. This year, he's popped up on a remix of 5 Seconds of Summer's "Easier" and co-wrote and co-produced Katy Perry's songs "Small Talk" and "Harleys in Hawaii." His network has expanded, too: "Mother" came about when he was in the studio working with behind-the-scenes wunderkind Andrew Watt on Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming album along with Louis Bell, Ryan Tedder and Billy Walsh. Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith, who was also in the studio playing on the Osbourne record, readily hopped on "Mother."
For now, he's focused on chasing his trio of singles with his third album. He says he has at least an album done, and that it's going to be more fun and less moody than Voicenotes, with surprising collaborations.
"What makes a good pop song is just a different way of saying something that's been said for so, so long," he says. "Bringing out an insecure feeling—we're all insecure in some way—and highlighting that and putting a beat to it and making the insecure feeling feel cool."

Texto completo: Selective deficit hysteria has done immense damage.
So the federal budget deficit just hit $ 1 trillion (actually $ 984 billion, but close enough). That's about $ 300 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office was projecting in the summer of 2017, before the Trump tax cut was enacted. And basically everybody yawned.
Were there fiery speeches in Congress, denouncing fiscal irresponsibility? No. Was there intense media coverage? No -- the story was tucked deep inside major newspapers. Was there severe market reaction? No -- interest rates are substantially lower than they were before the deficit surge.
This lack of reaction to a deficit that would have been considered shocking only a few years ago is sort of the fiscal policy equivalent of Sherlock Holmes's dog that didn't bark in the night. It tells us a lot about economics, politics -- specifically the utter hypocrisy of the G.O.P. -- and the news media, which on economic matters has a de facto conservative bias.
Start with the economics.
The budget deficit has now soared back roughly to where it was in 2012, when the unemployment rate was more than twice its current level, and the economy desperately needed deficit spending to sustain demand.
Back then, however, the inside-the-Beltway crowd was obsessed with deficit reduction. And it wasn't just politicians. As Ezra Klein, now the editor of Vox, noted at the time, "the rules of reportorial neutrality don't apply when it comes to the deficit. On this one issue, reporters are permitted to openly cheer a particular set of highly controversial policy solutions." And those of us who argued that reducing the deficit shouldn't be a high priority were treated like freaks.
But the deficit wasn't a crisis then, and it isn't one now. In fact, leading economists are now telling us that concerns about government debt have been greatly exaggerated all along. The Very Serious People were completely wrong, and those who opposed austerity have been vindicated.
Of course, while practically everyone in Washington was hyperventilating about debt circa 2012, the most apocalyptic warnings came from Republicans -- people like Paul Ryan (remember him?), who declared then, "In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time." His pose as the ultimate deficit hawk won him media adulation, which in turn propelled him into becoming speaker of the House.
The truth, however, is that right from the beginning it was obvious that Ryan was a phony. All you had to do was look at the actual content of his budget "plans." But the media narrative demanded that there be serious, honest Republicans, so that blame for the deficit could be equally divided between the parties; so Ryan was slotted into that role even though he was totally unsuited for the part.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
And then, when he and his party got a chance to exercise the fiscal responsibility they declared essential, they blew up the deficit instead. Republicans only pretended to care about debt as an excuse to hobble President Barack Obama and slash social programs. They were and are complete hypocrites when it comes to budgeting (and other things too, like patriotism, but that's another topic).
Which brings me to the issue of double standards.
When progressives propose new or expanded social programs, they face intense media scrutiny bordering on harassment over how they intend to pay for these programs. Republicans proposing tax cuts don't face anything like the same scrutiny; they are seemingly able to get away with blithe assertions that tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth, even though every single piece of evidence we have says that this is nonsense.
We're talking about big numbers here. As I said, the Trump budget blowout, overwhelmingly driven by tax cuts, seems to have raised the deficit by around $ 300 billion, or around 1½ percent of G.D.P. Over the course of the next decade, that would amount to something like $ 3.8 trillion -- substantially more than, for example, the combined cost of all of Elizabeth Warren's proposals other than Medicare for All, which we're still waiting to hear about.
And the truth is that proposals like universal child care are far more likely than tax cuts to repay a significant fraction of their upfront costs, partly by freeing up adults to work, partly by improving the lives of children in ways that will make them more productive adults.
The point is that the media clearly leans conservative in covering budget issues. Progressives face intense grilling over the cost of fairly modest social programs, while conservatives get a virtual free pass on budget-busting tax cuts.
Let me be clear here: I'm not complaining about the lack of panic over our trillion-dollar deficit. We shouldn't be panicked. The problem is the selectivity of deficit hysteria, which somehow kicks in only when a Democrat is president or progressives propose spending that would make American lives better.
That selective hysteria has done enormous harm. And those who propagate it need to be called out for their bias.

Official to Testify Appearance of 'Partisan Play' in Trump's Ukraine Call Raised Concerns; National Security Council aide Alexander Vindman also to tell impeachment investigators Sondland made Ukraine meeting with Trump contingent on probes

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A top official with the National Security Council plans to tell House impeachment investigators that he was concerned by President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that the president's request to have the Ukrainians investigate Joe Biden and his son may have been interpreted as a "partisan play."
Alexander Vindman, an Iraq war veteran who currently oversees Ukraine policy at the NSC, will be the first official with firsthand knowledge of the phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry to testify when he appears before House investigators on Tuesday.
According to a statement obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Vindman also plans to tell investigators that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told a Ukrainian delegation in early July that the government in Kyiv needed to deliver specific investigations to secure a meeting with Mr. Trump. The statement says that the July 10 meeting was cut short by then-national security adviser John Bolton, which corroborates with what others have testified to.
Mr. Bolton didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Trump sought to play down the testimony Tuesday morning, tweeting : "Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call."
Mr. Trump added: "Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE."
"Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma," the statement says. "I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push."
The statement was earlier obtained by the New York Times.
Mr. Vindman's statement notes that he listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President, adding, "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine."
Mr. Sondland testified to House committees that he raised investigations in the July 10 meeting but has said he was not aware of concerns from NSC officials about his doing so, a person familiar with his testimony said.
An expert on Ukraine and Russia, Mr. Vindman represented the administration as the lead NSC official on Ukraine policy and advocated for warmer ties with Ukraine at a time when Mr. Trump had been inclined to foster closer ties with Russia. Mr. Vindman was part of the U.S. delegation that attended Mr. Zelensky's inauguration, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and ambassadors Kurt Volker, Joseph Pennington and Mr. Sondland.
The role of former Vice President Biden's son Hunter at energy company Burisma Holdings Ltd. has come under intense scrutiny following unsupported accusations by Mr. Trump that the Democratic front-runner for president improperly tried to help his son's business interests in Ukraine.
Mr. Trump, in a July 25 call, asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr. Zelensky, to "look into" Mr. Biden and his son and said he would direct Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Attorney General William Barr to contact Mr. Zelensky to help him in a possible investigation, according to a rough transcript released by the White House.

Before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden's son, Mr. Trump reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine, according to the transcript, which was released in late September.
Mr. Vindman says that an investigation into the Biden family and Burisma "would likely be interpreted as a partisan play" which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. As a result, he reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.
In his prewritten testimony, Mr. Vindman also states that he is not the whistleblower whose official complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry, adding, "I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower."
"I did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command," he adds.
The Ukraine Witnesses
* Oct. 3: Kurt Volker, former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, testifies and hands over text messages with other State Department officials that showed officials attempting to use a potential meeting between Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as leverage to press Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden.
* Oct. 11: Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testifies that Mr. Trump sought for over a year to remove her and that his allies, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, targeted her in a "concerted campaign."
* Oct. 14: Fiona Hill, President Trump's former top Russia adviser, testifies that she and other White House officials grew so alarmed by the administration's efforts to push Ukraine to open certain investigations that they raised objections with a White House lawyer.
* Oct. 15: George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, testifies that he had grown concerned that he had been sidelined from Ukraine diplomacy and that he raised concerns in 2015 about Joe Biden's son serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
* Oct. 16: Michael McKinley, former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testifies that he left his post over frustration with Mr. Pompeo regarding the treatment of Ms. Yovanovitch.
* Oct. 17: Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, criticizes President Trump over his efforts to enlist Ukraine in investigating a political rival and says he and other U.S. officials were "disappointed" by the president's directive to work with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine matters.
* Oct. 22: William Taylor, chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that President Trump made nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine contingent on the Ukrainian president investigating two matters related to U.S. politics.

Employees Ask Facebook to Reverse Policy on Political-Ad Fact Checking; A letter signed by 250 employees argues that candidates' ads should not be exempt from checks

Texto completo: A group of Facebook Inc. employees asked the company to reverse its policy of exempting political candidates' ads from its own fact-checking program, calling the controversial rules a betrayal of the social-media giant's values.
"Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing," the employees said in an open letter to Facebook, which was posted on the company's internal network. They argue that exempting candidates' ads from fact checking "allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy."
Signed by 250 employees as of Monday, the letter represents less than 1% of the company's 40,000-person staff but adds to the debate over Facebook's political advertising policies . The company has long avoided fact-checking political candidates' personal Facebook posts, but only clarified earlier this month that it would exempt campaign advertising from such review .
In response to the letter, reported earlier by the New York Times, Facebook said internal debate and criticism of its policies are welcome.
"Facebook's culture is built on openness so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic," said spokeswoman Bertie Thomson. "We remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads."
The letter is the most recent example of employee activist efforts within major tech companies and social media platforms. Alphabet Inc.'s Google abandoned a contract with U.S. military last year in the wake of heavy employee opposition; Amazon.com Inc. has faced internal protests on climate-change; and companies including Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. have faced employee objections over their work with federal immigration enforcement agencies or contractors.
In the letter to Facebook, employees said the site's decision not to fact-check candidates' ads runs contrary to its two-year effort to fight misinformation on the platform and is confusing to the public.
News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook.
In response to a question from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg himself appeared hazy on whether the company would intervene if she targeted a Republican primary with ads falsely stating that one of the candidates supported the raft of progressive environmental proposals known as the Green New Deal .
"Congresswoman, I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. I think probably?" Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Per Facebook's policies, the correct answer is that an ad containing such a falsehood would be allowed only if it were purchased by a politician running for office. An independent organization, capitalizing on Mr. Zuckerberg's lack of clarity, bought an advertisement worded precisely as described by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Because the outside group lacked the exemption afforded to politicians, it was flagged by a Facebook fact-checking partner, Lead Stories, and eventually taken down.
Beyond taking issue with the fact-checking exemption itself, the employees asked the company to better distinguish political ads from user-created content and to limit political advertisers' ability to address ads to narrowly focused or custom-designed audiences.
"Currently we restrict targeting for housing and education and credit verticals due to a history of discrimination," the letter said, recommending that political advertisers be similarly restrained.
"We look forward to working towards solutions together," the letter concludes. "This is still our company."

Foley's mother grateful for US effort

Texto completo: Diane Foley, the mother of murdered war correspondent James Foley, said Sunday she was grateful to learn the US government was still searching for members of the group's leadership after news broke Sunday of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Baghdadi was the target of a US military raid in Syria, President Trump announced Sunday morning.
Foley, in a telephone interview shortly before Trump spoke, said the administration had given her a heads-up that an announcement was coming.
“I'm glad we are still on this issue," she said. “These folks are shrewd and will continue to pose a threat."
Foley's son James, a freelance war correspondent, was beheaded by members of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in 2014, nearly two years after he was kidnapped in Syria. James Foley's execution was intended as retaliation for US military actions in Iraq around that time, the group said in a video posted online.
Foley, who lives in Rochester, N.H., commended the bravery of military members who carried out the operation against Baghdadi. But she said she would have preferred that Baghdadi had been taken alive so he could be tried in a US court.
“My preference is for all of these ISIS fighters and leaders to be held in custody and face trial," Foley said.
Later, on Sunday night, Foley said in an e-mail that Trump had called her in the late afternoon.
“I am grateful for that kindness and for finding Baghdadi," she said.
John Foley, Diane's husband, told WMUR-TV that the war on ISIS must continue.
“I believe ISIS is like grass," John Foley said. “You mow it, but it continues to grow. And I don't think that the elimination of al-Baghdadi is the final answer."
Trump told reporters Sunday that Baghdadi was targeted by US forces in Syria and died after fleeing into a tunnel with three of his children and detonating an explosive suicide vest.
“He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone," Trump said. “He died like a dog, he died like a coward."
Trump had teased a major development on Twitter Saturday, and multiple media outlets early Sunday reported Baghdadi's death.
Later Sunday morning, Trump told reporters during the press conference that the United States had brought the “world's number-one terrorist leader to justice."
The president referred to James Foley as one of four Americans killed by the terror group whose deaths “were especially heinous."
Earlier this month, Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Syria's border with Turkey, which made room for the Turkish military to launch strikes in the region against Kurdish fighters who had been battling alongside US forces. The withdrawal also gave more than 100 Islamic State prisoners a chance to escape custody from Syrian prisons.
Officials were able to transfer two of Foley's son's alleged captors from a prison in Syria to one in Iraq following Turkey's incursion.
Foley said she has been waiting for the extradition of those men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey, to face charges in US civilian courts. She said she believes that a fair court trial is the appropriate way to hold former Islamic State fighters accountable for their actions.
During her call with Trump Sunday, Foley said, she asked the president to bring both men to the United States for trial.
She said she also hopes that more will be done to bring home those still held hostage in Syria, and she worries about their safety given the turmoil that followed the American withdrawal.
Trump has since reconsidered a total withdrawal, and could leave about 200 troops in eastern Syria, The New York Times has reported.
Foley, who called on Trump to reverse his decision to leave Syria in an Oct. 10 opinion column she co-wrote for The Washington Post, praised the government for potentially changing course.
“I am glad that the government is reconsidering a total pullout," Foley said. “That leadership is needed [in the] hunt for the residual ISIS fighters."

Dillow: Wonder: The simple antidote to what ails us

Texto completo: When New York Times bestselling author and award-winning sportswriter Joe Posnanski stood before a full house during the 2019 Booklovers’ Bash last weekend to share the primary motivation for writing his newest book, “The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini,” most people didn’t expect him to admit that he knew nothing about the magician when he settled on his subject matter.
It’s far more common for an author to write about a topic on which he or she is an expert; “write what you know” is usually the first piece of advice experienced writers share with aspiring ones.
Posnanski chose Houdini precisely for the opposite reason. Because his entire career has focused on writing about sports, he wanted to reignite his sense of wonder and curiosity by learning something new. This paradigm shift not only led him on a three-year research adventure about all things Houdini, he successfully regained a sense of wonder threatened by routine and predictability.
Wonder has been on my mind in the days since. It’s a powerful concept. A sense of wonder is defined in part by the Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction as the feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one’s awareness of what is possible.
It’s the “whoa” you whisper to yourself when something amazing stops you in your tracks; the curiosity that leads you down a rabbit hole of online clicking that makes you forget all the other stuff you should be doing. Almost without fail, a sense of wonder leads to a sense of appreciation for other people’s great ideas, for the magic of nature, for the ability to challenge boundaries.
Its close cousin is the self-fulfilling prophecy, because once we realize what’s possible, it’s much easier to step up and into that new level of possibility, too.
I have to say, feeling inspired by and appreciative for the ingenuity of humans and the power of nature seems a heck of a lot better – and more productive – than feeling outraged by the inexplicability of humans and nature.
In this spirit, I conducted a non-scientific experiment on myself. I paid more attention to things that elicited my sense of wonder, and I allowed time to really enjoy the feeling of awe that followed. I was interested to know how this shift in perspective would affect my outlook. A few things that made the list:
The Peacherine Ragtime Orchestra – This Baltimore-based ragtime band performed at the Cheyenne Civic Center on Wednesday evening, and while I expected to enjoy it, I did not predict how much I would enjoy it. The 12-member orchestra was technically masterful in every way, but it was the fact they played the original live soundtracks, complete with sound effects, for three silent movies starring Laurel & Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton that astounded me.
I realized in the first five minutes that I’ve never experienced a silent movie properly – I’d been doing it all wrong. I’ve seen a few of the most famous ones, but I’ve never heard a live ragtime orchestra accompany a silent movie cue for cue, the way it was intended to be shown. Seen this way, the movies were actually laugh-out-loud funny and far more sophisticated than I had ever given them credit for. My heart expanded a size in appreciation for a nearly extinct art form I thought I understood, but clearly did not.
Rats Driving Cars – If you haven’t heard the news stories this week about the University of Richmond researchers who trained actual rats to drive actual tiny cars designed specifically for them, go look up a video clip right now. This successful project will lead to greater understanding of how learning affects – and is affected by – emotional health. Only someone with a well-developed sense of wonder and an even bigger imagination could dream up rats driving cars in the name of science.
Eliud Kipchoge – Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge ran a sub-two-hour marathon this month. That translates to running a mile under four minutes … 26 times in a row. Yes, he had super-shoes designed by Nike just for this feat. Yes, a world-class team of pacemakers ran with him the entire way. The naysayers said nay because of those conditions, but 26.2 miles is still an awfully long distance to put one foot in front of the other that fast. Human endeavor: whoa.
November is fast approaching; with the season of gratitude it brings, I encourage you to start your own “sense of wonder” list. Your appreciation for what’s possible – especially when it’s unexpected – will grow, and you just might find yourself in awe (and gratitude) a little more often. It’s a good feeling.

Texto completo: It was raining in Ireland, and it was starting to get me down.
Before you say, "It always rains in Ireland!" let me tell you: I've been to Ireland many times, and yes, it rains. It rains, and then it gets sunny, or it rains, and then it stops. Many's the time I have worn sunglasses and had the windshield wipers going because the weather couldn't make up its mind.
But this trip was different. This trip was all-day-and-all-night-and-all-day downpours.
It might not have mattered that much, but my husband and I were there to hike.
In the remote village of Allihies where we were holed up, rain streamed past the windows of our B&B and flags snapped in the wind. The trails we had planned to walk squelched with standing water, the mountaintops we hoped to cross were enshrouded in fog. We couldn't hike, and so we read.
Allihies consisted of a tiny grocery, a cafe, a pub and a scattering of houses. There was no bookstore, no library. Fortunately, we had crammed our suitcases with books.
So I switched on the tea kettle and dove into "Say Nothing," Patrick Radden Keefe's nonfiction book about the Irish Troubles. It was so good that it made me wish we were in Belfast instead of West Cork, though it was also raining in Belfast.
It rained the next day, too, and I turned to "She Said," by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters who had broken the Harvey Weinstein story. Meanwhile, my husband was steadily reading Kevin Barry's "Night Boat to Tangier," a novel about two aging Irish thugs.
Each afternoon, the rain eased, we went for a hike, the rain started up again, and we returned to our books.
Would we rather be hiking the planned 15 miles from town to town? Of course; that was why we were there. But when something gets in the way of your plans, you have to make new plans.
So we tried to look at this forced relaxation as a good thing. When, other than during vacation, do we have hours of uninterrupted time in which to read? When else do we get a chance to sink into a book and consume it in a day?
From Dublin to Cork City to Allihies to Wicklow and back to Dublin, it rained hard almost every day. Instead of hiking over the mountains to the next B&B, we rode in taxis with our luggage and took shorter hikes in the afternoons. The rest of the time, we read.
In Wicklow, my husband chuckled over "The Shakespeare Requirement" by Julie Schumacher. I finished Charles Portis' "True Grit," which I loved so much I wished I hadn't yet read it, and started on Patti Smith's "Year of the Monkey."
We ended up in Dublin for the last few days. Dublin, city of bookstores! (And rain.) Good thing, because by now we were out of books.
We sloshed the mile from our B&B to the Winding Stair Bookshop. Rain dripped off our hoods as we tramped to Easons bookstore. We popped into Hodges Figgis. At each stop, we loaded up on Irish books: "Diary of a Somebody," by Brian Bilston; Joseph O'Connor's "Shadowplay"; "This House Is Haunted," by John Boyne; a novel by Dermot Bolger, whose play we had just seen at the Abbey Theatre; a collection of stories by Nicole Flattery.
When the rain got too wet, we hoofed it back to our B&B, switched on the tea kettle, and read.
Trips don't always go as planned. Life doesn't always go as planned. Sometimes you have to tear things up and start over. For us, for this trip, books kept us going.
Do you have stories about vacations and books? Send them to books@startribune.com and we'll run them on a future Sunday.

Texto completo: Un arresto en el verano fue crucial para conseguir la baja de Abu Bakr al Bagdadi, el líder de ISIS, este fin de semana.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el plan para emboscar a Al Bagdadi comenzó en el verano cuando la CIA consiguió información sobre la ubicación del líder del supuesto califato gracias al arresto de una de sus esposas y un mensajero.
Relacionado: Trump cree que baja del líder de ISIS es mucho más grande que la de Osama Bin Laden
El interrogatorio a la mujer, que era de toda la confianza de Al Bagdadi, llevó a la CIA a unir fuerzas con iraquíes y kurdos para conseguir la ubicación específica. El Times asegura que los kurdos siguieron brindado información a Estados Unidos , sin importar que el presidente Donald Trump hubiera retirado a las tropas del norte de Siria para permitir una incursión turca.
Una fuente kurda dijo a EFE que habían estado coordinándose durante estos últimos meses con Washington, a quien agradeció su papel, pero el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Mark Esper , subrayó que la información acerca de la ubicación precisa de Al Bagdadi fue aportada por Turquía 48 horas antes de la misión.
Durante ella, los comandos estadounidenses atravesaron espacio aéreo ruso, por lo que Moscú fue avisado, y también le dio las gracias junto a Damasco .
Relacionado: Trump confirma que líder de ISIS murió en operativo en Siria: “Murió como un cobarde”
Idlib es el último feudo insurrecto en Siria en el que se han concentrado una miríada de grupos extremistas y que habían dado una vía a Al Bagdadi para refugiarse, entre los que destaca la facción Hurras al Din (Guardianes de la Religión), la imagen de la red extremista Al Qaeda en Siria.
Es el Organismo de Liberación del Levante , una alianza islamista en la que está incluida la exfilial siria de Al Qaeda, la que controla prácticamente todo Idlib, considerada “terrorista” por Damasco y Moscú, que desarrollan desde el 30 de abril una ofensiva contra ellos.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MRS. FLETCHER 10:30 p.m. on HBO. This series is based on Tom Perrotta's novel "Mrs. Fletcher," which was published in 2017 and tackles themes of misogyny, sexuality and female empowerment. Like the book, the limited series follows Eve Fletcher, a divorced mom (Kathryn Hahn) in her mid-40s, and her son Brendan (Jackson White), an entitled jock starting his freshman year at college, as they embark on respective journeys of sexual enlightenment. While Brendan struggles to connect with his political-minded peers and confronts conversations about consent, Eve indulges in her newfound freedom by going down an internet pornography rabbit hole. "'Mrs. Fletcher' is a very right-now show," Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The New York Times. "It's one of many short-run half-hour dramedies about a woman entering a new phase of her life who discovers new vectors of sexuality and self-actualization while also being treated shabbily."
KILLER SIBLINGS 8 p.m. on Oxygen. When Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of murdering their wealthy parents, they became perhaps the highest profile case of killer siblings. "It led many to wonder what dark family history or twisted psychology might have led two privileged, handsome and self-assured youths to do away with their parents in the most savage way," Kenneth B. Noble wrote in his coverage of the trial for The New York Times. "And it raised a question of almost biblical dimensions: Can a child ever be justified in murdering a parent?" This new true crime series delves deeper into that phenomenon, focusing on other cases of murderous siblings, starting with the Gustafsons, three siblings who sought revenge against the star witness in their brother's murder trial.
NO TIME LIKE CHRISTMAS 8 p.m. on Lifetime. While most of us are still trying to wrangle up a suitable Halloween costume, Lifetime has gone straight into the Christmas season with its annual slate of original holiday programming. Over the next two months, It's a Wonderful Lifetime will screen 28 premiere movies. In one of those films, "No Time Like Christmas," Emma (Kyla Pratt) teams up with her former college boyfriend, Fletcher, (Ed Ruttle) in an attempt to save a local theater. As they plan a Christmas Eve showcase, with help from Emma's sister and Fletcher's daughter, iced-over romantic feelings begin to thaw.
What's Streaming
THE WITCH (2015) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube and Vudu. Like his latest film "The Lighthouse," Robert Eggers's first feature directorial effort "The Witch" harnesses a specific kind of New England eeriness. In it, a family of God-fearing Puritan settlers wrestles with their faith as rumors of witchcraft swirl around the eldest daughter, Thomasin. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the director's "sharpest decision, what makes you and the movie jump, is that he stays inside the characters' worlds and heads, all disastrously close quarters."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- My first job in journalism was as a clerk at The Washington Star. I fielded a lot of calls from readers threatening to cancel their subscriptions -- including, on occasion, my mom.
I never got upset about it. Their loss, I figured. I know, because I prowl through at least eight newspapers a day, that I feel about 1,000 percent smarter and more interesting afterward.
I've always noticed a huge difference in leaders who read the news carefully, like Barack Obama, an avid New York Times reader, and those, like Donald Trump, who fail to feed their brains properly. The nasty Narcissus looks at the papers not to broaden himself but for the most narrow of reasons: to hunt for his own name and to search, largely in vain, for any scrap of positive coverage.
Trump cheerleader Tomi Lahren recently tweeted a picture proving that the White House staff is still artificially sweetening what they show the boss. The president sent Lahren a printout of tweets -- including hers -- praising him for his Dallas rally, compiled by his aides to reinforce Trump's reality distortion field.
President Snowflake had a pout this past week and canceled the White House subscriptions to The Times and The Washington Post. He probably thinks the papers are still delivered by boys in tweed news caps tossing them over the fence in the general direction of the West Wing.
Get those damn papers off my lawn!
Stephanie Grisham, Trump's press secretary, imperiously announced that the White House would also strong-arm federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the papers, noting that this would be "a significant cost saving" to taxpayers.
Not as much, of course, as if Trump stopped spending tens of millions on golf outings after savaging his predecessor for excessively hitting the links. Besides, taxpayers would probably be happy to spend the money on newspapers if the president would stop staring at his name and educate himself on the globe.
The enormity of his stupidity caused him to accomplish the impossible: He managed to bollix up America's Middle East policy even more, after we had already shattered the region through ignorance and arrogance.
In dropping The Times and The Post, the president came across like all those liberals on Twitter who bristle with cancelitis. They're always huffing away from our paper only to sneak back a few days later.
Trump's move is not without precedent.
As Michael Grynbaum reported in The Times, J.F.K. was widely mocked when he canceled The New York Herald Tribune and said he would read The St. Louis Post-Dispatch instead. After sneaking in copies of The Tribune for a while, President Kennedy resumed openly reading it.
The same will happen with Trump. He can't quit us. The relationship of Donald and the media is the greatest love affair -- and mutual addiction -- of all time. When he cancels subscriptions, it's like an angry lover tearing up pictures of a woman he is obsessed with but cannot win over.
Newspapers are liquid history, with deadlines pressing and people trying to pull the wool over our eyes. God knows, we're not perfect. But we're definitely better arbiters of objective reality than Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise.
Given the perverted values we've seen in other institutions, such as Facebook, the Catholic Church, the Bush-Cheney White House and the Trump White House, it feels good to be part of an institution that aims to illuminate rather than obscure.
Speaking of spin, I've got a push alert for Kellyanne Conway: No matter how many reporters you dress down, your tortured triangle with George and Donald is a real story. No one in Washington has seen anything like it since the days of Martha Mitchell.
So, Mr. President, given that you are shorn from The Times and The Post, I feel an obligation to fill you in on what you're missing:
You're about to be impeached.
Nancy Pelosi is kicking your butt.
The Deep State is not only out to get you; it's gotten you.
The Republicans on the Hill who tried to crash the hearing -- even though their fellow Republicans were taking part -- looked like fanatical losers. Matt Gaetz compared his stunt to the Spartans and the movie "300," but he's no Gerard Butler and his pizza party was lame.
Your long-suffering Republican allies/hostages are finally getting tired of having to defend you all the time.
You're canny about media. You know that you can't hurt The Times and The Post by having a childish fit of pique; that just sells more newspapers.
The only way you could cut the clicks is if you calmed down, behaved properly and acted like a decent human being, so that there weren't always 20 breaking news stories every day about your conspiring and grifting and lying and lunacy.
And there's no chance of that, because then all eyes wouldn't be on you.
You'll sneak back and you know it.

Texto completo: 1. The President did solicit interference. "I would like you to do us a favor," Mr. Trump said in his call with Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine, according to the White House account of the call. 2. Giuliani and Barr were involved. Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky that Attorney General William Barr and the president's personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani would call him. 3. There was reason for alarm. The inspector general for the intelligence agencies, Michael Atkinson, confirmed in a Sept. 9 letter to Congress that the whistle-blower's complaint "met the definition of an urgent concern." 4. Yes, that's what he said. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution ... so if you can look into it ... I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. ... The server, they say Ukraine has it," Mr. Trump said in the call, citing a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. "That whole nonsense ended ... they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible." 5. White House officials knew the call was problematic. Officials raised these concerns with the National Security Council's chief lawyer, John Eisenberg, The Washington Post reported. 6. This is not proved. This has not been confirmed. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress on Nov. 6. 7. A transcript was put in a highly classified computer system. Administration officials told reporters that National Security Council lawyers decided to place it there. 8. They coordinated closely with the Ukrainians. "Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington," Kurt Volker, the State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine, texted Mr. Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak on July 25. 9. Giuliani told Ukrainians what needed to be done. "Rudy and Yermak ... are going to get together when Rudy goes to Madrid in a couple of weeks," Mr. Volker texted on July 22. Three days earlier he texted: "Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation." 10. Giuliani reached out to senior Ukrainian officials. "Bohdan ... told me that they had heard from Mr. Giuliani that the phone call between the two presidents was unlikely to happen," William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, said in his opening statement to House investigators. 11. Ukrainian officials did travel to Washington. Ms. Hill told Mr. Taylor that when Mr. Yermak and another Ukrainian official met at the White House with the then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and others, Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, "had connected 'investigations' with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelenskyy, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting," Mr. Taylor said in his statement. 12. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was summarily recalled. "After being asked ... in early March to extend my tour until 2020, I was then abruptly told in late April to come back ... 'on the next plane' ... I met with the Deputy Secretary of State, who informed me of the curtailment of my term," Ms. Yovanovitch testified. 13. Yuriy Lutsenko, a Ukrainian prosecutor, undercut the ambassador. "The U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives," Ms. Yovanovitch testified. 14. Trump officials worried about Giuliani's behavior. Ms. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton said, "Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up." 15. A White House meeting depended on Ukrainian political aid. In a July 10 meeting, Mr. Sondland said there was an agreement that Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump would meet at the White House if Ukraine began investigations sought by the White House, Ms. Hill testified. According to Mr. Taylor, an N.S.C. official, Tim Morrison, said, "Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation." 16. The administration turns colder toward Ukraine. Mr. Taylor said that in mid-August, he asked Mr. Morrison "if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded, 'it remains to be seen.' He also told me during this call that the 'President doesn't want to provide any assistance at all."' 17. More about the highly classified server. See No. 7. The Times reported on Sept. 27 that records of calls Mr. Trump made with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia have also been put in that system. 18. Ukraine aid is frozen. In a video-conference call on July 18, Mr. Taylor said, "I heard a staff person from the Office of Management say ... her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice." 19. The aid freeze was ordered by the President. "All that the OMB staff person said," according to Mr. Taylor, "was that the directive had come from the President."

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney commended President Trump on selecting someone other than him to be his secretary of state, joking that he may not have lasted more than a few weeks.
“The best personnel decision he made was not choosing me,” the Utah Republican told the New York Times.
“I would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson, and maybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci did,” he added, referring respectively to Trump’s first secretary of state and the White House communications director who was fired less than two weeks on the job.
Trump considered Romney to be the administration’s top diplomat, even though he was one of the president’s harshest critics during the 2016 presidential campaign. As payback for the criticism, Trump, who endorsed Romney in the 2012 election against President Barack Obama, has called Romney a “pompous ass” and said he should be impeached.
Romney’s wife, Ann, said her husband would have accepted the secretary of state job had Trump offered it to him instead of Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil.

Romney, 72, said in 2017 that he had even consulted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about the job.

Texto completo: Readers weigh in on a literary divide. Also: Brave Americans who come forward.
To the Editor:
Re "Did Harold Bloom Win the Canon Wars?," by Joe Karaganis and David McClure (Sunday Review, Oct. 20):
The "canon wars" involving the literary scholar Harold Bloom and the novelist Toni Morrison constitute little more than a grandiose name for a squabble in American English departments. This is not meant to diminish the achievement of either but simply to reassess their influence.
I served on faculties with both: as a graduate student and assistant professor at Yale along with Mr. Bloom, and as a professor and dean of the Graduate School at Princeton with Ms. Morrison.
In the departments with which I was associated -- specifically German and comparative literature, and more generally classics, medieval studies and foreign languages -- neither name played a role. With no assistance from Mr. Bloom the Western canon has thrived in those fields, and the additions of Ms. Morrison have had no impact.
If the humanities have declined, it is because the battles over theory and canon have distracted too many colleagues in English departments. As for the STEM subjects, several recent studies have shown that students trained in the humanities have the intellectual flexibility required to adapt when technological change kills jobs in many fields.
When all our students know the linguistic origin and meaning of quid pro quo they will survive nicely.

To the Editor:
Joe Karaganis and David McClure ask whether Harold Bloom or Toni Morrison "won" the canon wars. It's the wrong question.
The marginalized books and writers Ms. Morrison supported did not replace the works Mr. Bloom promoted. They transformed how we read and understand Mr. Bloom's "classics."
Once you have read Sterling A. Brown's poem "Ma Rainey," with its distinctive presentation of the art and the subject matter of the blues singer, you will inevitably begin to rethink the art and subject matter of landmark poems like T.S. Eliot's "Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."
Ms. Morrison argued that understanding the powerful "Africanist" presence in American culture transforms how we read American books. She was right. That is her triumph.

To the Editor:
Regarding the brave Americans -- career Foreign Service officers and others -- who are coming forward at great risk to themselves to give evidence of the crimes and corruption of Donald Trump: They are the much-reviled "deep state." Americans, conservative and liberal alike, are very lucky to have them.

Facebook includes right-wing site Breitbart in media compensation plan

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Facebook officially launched its new News tab service on Friday and created new controversy by revealing that Breitbart News will be among the news outlets contributing to its latest foray into online news publication.
"Given that Facebook is putting actual news outlets in the same category as Breitbart, actual news outlets should consider quickly withdrawing from the program," said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit media watchdog.
At an event in New York launching the project, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Breitbart's inclusion: "You want to include a breadth of content to make sure all different topics can be covered."
Other participants include The Washington Post, the New York Times, News Corp. , BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, Bloomberg News, Fox News, NBCUniversal, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.
Breitbart was founded by ring-wing commentator Andrew Breitbart in 2007, and it gained a reputation over the years for championing fringe causes. Its former executive chairman was Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to President Trump.
Word that Breitbart is among the outlets whose work will be included in Facebook's new News tab is likely only to heighten criticism about the way Facebook responds to political issues. In recent weeks, the website has been lambasted for policies that critics say allow politicians to lie in their ads and do not require that clearly false material posted on the platform be removed.
The new controversy came on a day intended to mark a new chapter in the relationship between news outlets and the behemoth tech platforms that historically have not paid for the journalistic content they republish. As part of its News tab, Facebook has agreed to compensate at least some news organizations as part of a specialized feature meant to steer users toward curated national and local news stories.
The News tab marks the latest iteration of Facebook's approach to online news. Before January 2018, the company had been a leading distributor of news, but that role was dogged by the presence in its news feed of false and misleading information, as well as by allegations that its news feed and other features tilted toward liberal viewpoints. So last year the company shifted its focus to promote posts from users' friends and family members, but the revamped news feed also hurt traffic for many news outlets that had tailored their offerings to appeal to Facebook's audience.
Zuckerberg did not go into specifics about how different publishers would be compensated, and media analysts expressed skepticism that the arrangement will help the small and medium-size local outlets that have been most seriously undercut by the rise of online news distribution.
"The vast majority of local news outlets are not included, and that is part of the news ecosystem that's most at risk," said David Chavern, the president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, a trade association of news publishers.
Chavern called Facebook's agreement to pay at least some news outlets for their content a step in the right direction, noting that tech platforms have been "uniquely unwilling to pay for news and quality journalism."
It was unclear whether other platforms would follow Facebook. In a statement, Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said the company had worked "for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to publishers world wide."
"Every month we send more than 24 [billion] clicks to publishers websites," she said. "This content discovery adds up to real business value for publishers." She added that publishers that use Google's tools to monetize content receive 70 percent of ad revenue and 85 to 95 percent of subscription revenue, depending on the platform.
In June, a study by the News Media Alliance found that Google reaped an estimated $4.7 billion of revenue in 2018 from scraping news publishers' content - without paying the publishers for that use. The study found that news is a key driver of user engagement on Google's products.
Meanwhile, the news industry has taken massive hits from declines in print advertising and competition from digital platforms for online ad revenue.
The News tab is available to more than 200,000 Facebook users in the United States, with a broader rollout planned for early next year. The new service, Facebook executives say, should make it easier for users to find the day's major headlines and stories tailored to specific topics or locales.
The initiative could reach 20 million to 30 million people over a few years, Zuckerberg said, and will eventually include a wider set of local and international publishers. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the decision to pay some publishers was unlikely to revive the news industry fully.
Zuckerberg also insisted that the team of journalists curating Facebook News' top stories will not shy away from critical coverage of him or Facebook.

More about the Hoffman family ghost

Texto completo: Last fall — just before Halloween — I wrote a column about a mysterious ghost who allegedly invaded the Wooster home of the David Hoffman family 150 years ago. The information, sent to me by Wooster historian Harry McClarran, had appeared in a book of newspaper articles from the 1870s.
Back then, the Wooster poltergeist received wide-spread press coverage ... all the way to the East Coast where an article appeared in the May 24, 1871, edition of The New York Times.
Not long after last year’s Daily Record column ran, author Chris Woodyard of Dayton wrote to say she had more Hoffman ghost information. She wrote about the poltergeist in her book “The Face in the Window: Haunting Ohio Tales” under a chapter titled “A Family Bewitched: The Hoffman Poltergeist of Wooster.”
“The ghost,” explained the author, “had been labeled ‘IT’ by those it tormented. The mysterious pranks that afflicted the Hoffman family were begun in June 1869, while the family lived in Millersburg.”
At first, Mr. Hoffman noticed his money was disappearing. Then food items and articles of clothing began to disappear. It was reported that crockery fell without the aid of human hands, and stones, eggs and other small objects were tossed wildly through the house.
Having tried unsuccessfully to rid the home of its malignant spirit, Mr. Hoffman decided to move his wife and three children from Millersburg to Wooster — hoping to escape the mischievous “IT.” At the same time, Mr. Hoffman decided to move into his own temporary quarters at the mill where he was employed and where, it turned out, he escaped further ghostly pranks.
But, the ghostly spirit followed his wife and three children to their new address at 504 W. Liberty St. The clothes of the mother and eldest daughter were slashed and the family linens were found stuffed into the mouth of the cellar drain. Poundings were heard on the walls at night, dishes rattled and stones were thrown through doors and windows.
The Wooster Republican reported on May 25, 1871, “clairvoyant and medium Madame Thompson of Cleveland” had come to Wooster attempting to communicate with the spirit.
Woodyard explained the local press declared “a most helpful watch had been kept” and hundreds of men and women had visited and inspected the premises without finding any clue to solving the mystery.
Eventually the Hoffman family moved to Akron. Although husband and wife never divorced, they never lived together again.
Today the existence of the Hoffman ghost remains a mystery.
FYI
Countless nationally known entertainers have performed on the College of Wooster campus. Among them were actors Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Vincent Price, Ernest Borgnine, musicians Doc Severinson, the Beach Boys, Chicago, Sly and the Family Stone, Charlie Daniels, Ravi Shankar and basketball whiz kids the Harlem Globe Trotters. Recently musician Pharrell Williams spoke on campus.

Texto completo: Noor Alexandria Abukaram ran a personal-best time in a cross-country meet last Saturday. Then the 16-year-old Ohio high school student found out her race didn't count.
Abukaram was disqualified from her team's meet for wearing a hijab while in competition. A practicing Muslim who attends private Islamic school in Sylvania, Ohio, Abukaram competes in athletics for the local public school, Northview High School.
"It was like your worst nightmare to have to compete and then find out that you got disqualified and it's because of something that you love," Abukaram told CNN. "Why should you have to sacrifice your religion and a part of who you are to run, to do another thing that you're very passionate about?"

NOT ENOUGH: Astros must pay a steeper price for lies
Abukaram told several news media outlets she had competed in six meets this season without any problems. She also said officials did not address her hijab immediately after the race. Meet officials told her that her coach ultimately didn't fill out the correct paperwork.
“When (her coach) told me that, I was like, what do you mean I have to have a signed waiver for me to race?” she told The New York Times. “They don’t have to prepare anything special for me, I don’t have any disabilities, I am just running just like anybody else. When he said that, I didn’t think, ‘Oh, Coach, why didn’t you do this?’ I thought, ‘Why do we even have to do this in the first place?’”
In an emotional Facebook post, Abukaram wrote, in part: "I feel like my rights as an athlete were violated this weekend. . . . . I should not have to get a waiver signed and approved by OSAA to allow me to race due to my religious head covering. "
Tim Stried, a spokesman for the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), told USA TODAY in a statement Friday that the organization had been examining the rule and was considering dropping the waiver requirement.
“The student-athlete can run this weekend at regionals, and the OHSAA is also already looking at this specific uniform regulation to modify it in the future so that religious headwear does not require a waiver," Stried's statement read.
"If the coach or school had obtained the waiver previously, all this could have been avoided. The race official was simply enforcing this rule since a waiver had not been submitted. After the race, the OHSAA communicated with the school, which then submitted a waiver request. The request was approved immediately. This emphasizes our continual requirement to also assist in educating our coaches on all sport rules. We support the student-athlete and wish her the best of luck this weekend at regionals. ”
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, heard about the situation and expressed her criticism of the school on Thursday over Twitter, blasting "discriminatory dress codes. "
“I’ve got your back, Noor,” Warren wrote. “Every kid should be able to feel safe and welcome at school — and Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities. ”

Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg Urges Tech Rivals to Pay for News; Social giant launches news service featuring array of news outlets and pays to license content

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the social-media giant's decision to pay media outlets who participate in its news service will give a much-needed boost to the publishing industry and provides a model other internet companies should follow.
Multiple major news publishers from the Washington Post to Fox News to The Wall Street Journal have signed on to the service, which launched Friday with a limited test audience of 200,000 users in the U.S. and will be rolled out more broadly early next year.
Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook's service could have a positive impact on big and small publishers alike, but can't solve the media industry's deep woes on its own.
"I think every internet platform has a responsibility to help fund and support news," he said at an event in New York where he discussed the service with Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, which owns the Journal. "Hopefully others will follow the model we are helping to set up."

BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith said Facebook's licensing strategy "is part of a really positive trend that will put a lot of pressure on Google and others to pay publishers."
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Alphabet Inc.'s Google said the company already plays a key role in helping news outlets monetize online content through the traffic its search engine sends to their sites and revenue generated through Google's ad platforms, which most publishers rely on.
"Every month we send more than 24 billion clicks to publishers' websites," the statement said. "Publishers around the world can use Google tools for monetizing their content, and when they do, they receive over 70% of the ad revenue."
Facebook has said it plans to include news from as many as 200 publications, although many won't receive licensing fees, the Journal has reported . Among those that are paid, the fees may vary considerably. In its discussions ahead of the launch, Facebook had offered hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers, a few million for bigger ones, and substantially more for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with those talks.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing regulatory scrutiny. Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, addressing another long-running complaint from publishers.
The new service marked a key shift, said Mr. Thomson, who has been sharply critical of Facebook and Google in the past for issues including their opaque algorithms, digital advertising dominance and for not paying for news on their platforms.
"Great journalism will only be sustainable at scale if there is a fundamental change in the landscape like this," he said. Mr. Thomson said Facebook's move was "a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments."
News Corp's deal with Facebook—which covers the New York Post and Dow Jones publications such as The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's—will generate fees reaching into the double-digit millions of dollars annually, people familiar with the agreement said. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment.
Other outlets that agreed to participate include USA Today-owner, Gannett Co., the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Condé Nast, NBC News, ABC News, Bloomberg Media, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider. Facebook hasn't disclosed financial terms of its arrangements with publishers.
Facebook, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, sought to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, although it said they must meet certain standards of trustworthiness. While the conspiracy-theory website Infowars won't be included, headlines from far-right website Breitbart might appear.
When asked about Breitbart, Mr. Zuckerberg declined to speak about specific media sources, but said, "having someone be in there doesn't necessarily mean the curators will choose to highlight them."
While Facebook will have the ability to choose any headline from media outlets that have joined, only a small number would appear in the feed—some chosen by human curation and others by Facebook's algorithms. When users click on a link within Facebook News, they will be sent to the publisher's site.
Licensing fees have been viewed as a potentially valuable source of revenue for publishers struggling to compete for digital-ad dollars against Facebook and Google, the so-called duopoly that together commands nearly 60% of the U.S. market. Many publishers are trying to develop other revenue streams, such as user subscriptions, events and content licensing.
Earlier this year, Apple announced a partnership with more than 300 magazines and several digital media outlets and newspapers, including the Journal, for a $9.99 a month subscription news bundle called Apple News+. As part of the deal, publishers would split 50% of the revenue based on readership of their stories.
Curating a news section is a shift for Facebook, which until now has mainly been a platform for users to share news articles with each other. "People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience. We want to support both," Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president for news partnerships, wrote in a blog post.
During the trial run, Facebook said it plans to showcase news from local publications in major metro areas like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, Miami, Atlanta and Boston. The news section will eventually include news from Facebook's local news service, Today In.

Texto completo: A fresh chance to pick up a piece of Neil Armstrong memorabilia rolls up Friday when a Dallas auction house opens bidding on the fourth parcel of rare goods the space hero's sons have put up for sale.
The auctions, which have raised roughly $12 million so far, concerned some people close to the late astronaut – by nature a private person who stopped signing autographs when he learned people sold them.
In July, the astronaut's personal lawyer, Ross Wales, told the New York Times the auctions ran counter to that spirit: Armstrong "just didn't like to be made a fuss over."
But one of Armstrong's two sons, Mark, outlined in an email to The Enquirer the dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others, my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue since my father's passing," he wrote.
The Wapakoneta native was the first man on the moon. The auctions of his belongings have coincided with the yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing July 20, 1969.
Since October 2018, Heritage Auctions of Dallas has conducted three auctions of possessions that Rick and Mark Armstrong inherited from their parents, including hundreds of items from their father's astronaut career.
Rick Armstrong of Mason, the astronaut's elder son, declined to discuss the auctions.
In two emails, younger son Mark Armstrong of West Chester Township told The Enquirer he and wife Wendy plan to use a portion of their auction proceeds to build a charitable organization called Vantage Earth Foundation focused on the fate of the planet.
Aerospace historian James R. Hansen published his definitive biography, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," in 2005, and the book became a 2018 movie.
"My concern as a historian is that I would want to know if there are any historically significant documents," Hansen said, such as a letter to Armstrong from Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.
Armstrong gave 450 boxes of his papers to his alma mater, Purdue University. In October 2018, the collection's archivist wrote a letter to the Times that the Armstrong auctions were "problematic." The archivist didn't respond to emails for comment.
Mark Armstrong's email outlined dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions. He said they also have ensured that auctioned items have been cataloged for public review.
The Lindbergh letter, for example, has been on loan since June 2017 to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, he said, and will not be in the auction.
In May, the brothers donated the Explorers Club flag "that our father flew on Apollo 11" to the Explorers Club in New York.
About a month ago, Mark Armstrong said, he and his brother made a donation of items to the University of Cincinnati, where their father taught for decades.
Among the goods is a 1971 letter from a key House leader thanking the astronaut for his service to the nation: "Surely NASA's loss is the University of Cincinnati's gain."
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor to Armstrong. That honor now is displayed at the "Destination Moon" exhibit of the Cincinnati Museum Center. Mark Armstrong said he and his brother have offered the medal permanently to the Smithsonian.
This gold medal that flew aboard Apollo 11 half a century ago sold at auction in July for $2.05 million.

Texto completo: A federal judge said the education secretary had violated an order to stop collecting on loans owed by students from a now-defunct for-profit chain of colleges.
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday fined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for contempt of court, ruling that she had violated an order to stop collecting on loans owed by students from a now-defunct for-profit chain of colleges.
Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the Education Department to pay a $ 100,000 fine. The money will go toward various remedies for students who are owed debt relief after President Barack Obama's Education Department found they were defrauded by the chain, Corinthian Colleges, which collapsed in 2014.
The ruling is a victory for the more than 60,000 students who have been on a financial roller coaster since Corinthian imploded, after state and federal officials found that it lured students through deceptive recruitment practices and falsified job placement rates.
The decision stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2017 by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, both of which represent former Corinthian students. For more than a year, the students' lawyers argued that Ms. DeVos had illegally punished thousands of cheated students who were owed relief from the federal government.
Toby Merrill, director of the project, said that the ruling demonstrated "the extreme harm" of Ms. DeVos's actions. "Secretary DeVos has repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students' debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable," she said.
In a video statement posted on Twitter, Mark Brown, chief operating officer of the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office, said that loan servicers had "mistakenly" billed about 16,000 students and parents.
"Although these actions were not done with ill intent, students and parents were affected and we take full responsibility for that," Mr. Brown said.
He said the department had taken swift action to respond, including refunding nearly all payments that borrowers should not have had to make, returning tax refunds and wages that were seized, and updating credit reports for affected students and parents. He said the department had also formally reprimanded loan servicers that collected debts, and initiated personnel action against Education Department employees who failed in their oversight roles.
In 2015, Arne Duncan, the education secretary at the time, announced that the department would use a provision known as "borrower defense to repayment" to forgive the federal student debts of Corthinian's students. "You'd have to be made of stone not to feel for these students," he said. "This is our first major action on this but obviously it won't be the last."
But the department moved slowly to establish a formal process for discharging the students' debts, and by the time Mr. Obama left office, only 12,000 Corinthian students had their ledgers wiped clean. Tens of thousands more awaited relief.
Instead of fully eliminating those students' debts, however, Ms. DeVos instituted a new system for borrower defense claims that granted little to no debt forgiveness if those students were found to have earned a livable wage. The Project on Predatory Student Lending filed a lawsuit challenging that system.
Last year, Magistrate Judge Kim found the system illegal, ruling that the Education Department had violated borrowers' privacy by obtaining and misusing their earnings data from the Social Security Administration. She issued an injunction ordering the department to stop using the data and collecting the debts of Corinthian students. The department appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and is waiting for a ruling.
But the department, through the outside student loan servicers that it pays to handle borrowers' accounts, kept pursuing the debts and even garnished some students' tax refunds and wages. The department's loan servicers sent at least 16,000 Corinthian borrowers bills for payments they did not actually owe. The students' lawyers asked the court to halt those collections and punish the department for its actions.
In a response to scathing criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over her handling of the debt collection, Ms. DeVos wrote on Twitter this month: "Loan servicers made an error on a small # of loans. We know & we're fixing it."
Magistrate Judge Kim made it clear this month that she believed the department had acted badly. "I'm astounded, really," she said during a fiery hearing. "I feel like there have to be some consequences for the violation of my order 16,000 times."
In her ruling on Thursday, Magistrate Judge Kim wrote that the department had made "only minimal efforts to comply" with her order, and that it had "harmed individual borrowers who were forced to repay loans." She also ordered the Education Department to file monthly status reports detailing its compliance.
The Project on Predatory Lending said that more than 3,000 borrowers made payments that they were not, in fact, required to make. More than 800 students have had their credit reports tarnished, and 1,800 had their wages garnished or tax refunds seized. More than 1,100 remain in limbo because the department has not yet confirmed whether they are in the correct repayment status.
The department has essentially stopped evaluating borrower defense claims -- leaving borrowers in limbo, sometimes for years -- while it waits for the courts to resolve its appeal. The agency had 210,000 pending claims awaiting a decision as of June, up from the 106,000 claims it had sitting in its queue a year earlier.
In August, the Education Department rewrote its rules for the borrower-defense program, making it significantly harder for borrowers to qualify. The new policies will apply to federal student loans made from July 2020 onward.

"But Her Emails ..." (editorial, Oct. 23):
I am disappointed that The Times did not use the opportunity to apologize for its obsessive coverage of this Hillary Clinton nonscandal in 2016. According to an article in the Columbia Journalism Review, "in just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election."
Mrs. Clinton lost the election for myriad reasons, but it did not help that The Times's coverage of this issue reinforced many voters' suspicions that she was untrustworthy. Jeffrey Toobin, chief legal analyst for CNN, apologized this week for hyping the email story during that crucial moment. If The Times wants to regain the trust of its readers heading into 2020, it should do the same.

Texto completo: The president was not mentioned in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. But then came a federal court hearing.
The criminal case against two associates of President Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, became explicitly connected to the president on Wednesday when a defense lawyer made a surprising argument that some of the evidence gathered in the investigation could be subject to executive privilege.
The two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested and accused of making illegal political campaign contributions in exchange for influence. The indictment filed by federal prosecutors did not name or identify Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Trump in connection with the charges.
But Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have been linked to Mr. Giuliani's attempts on behalf of Mr. Trump to gather damaging information in Ukraine about the president's political foes. That campaign is the focus of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
The executive privilege argument given on Wednesday drew renewed attention to the work Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman conducted to benefit Mr. Trump, as well as to the ties between the two men, the president and Mr. Giuliani.
Here is what we know about the relationship between the two men and President Trump:
The two men have met Mr. Trump but never worked directly for him
So far, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman directly worked for the president, and Mr. Parnas's lawyer denied in court on Wednesday that his client had worked for the United States government in connection to Ukraine.
After Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested earlier this month, Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know them and said that he thought they might be Mr. Giuliani's clients. "Now it's possible that I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody," the president said on the White House South Lawn.
Indeed photos exist showing Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have had at least brief interactions with Mr. Trump.
In March 2018, Mr. Trump took a photo with Mr. Fruman at a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Florida. In the photo, featured in an article on Forum Daily, the president is giving two thumbs-up to the camera.
Mr. Fruman told Forum Daily, which bills itself as the "voice of Russian-speaking America," that he was invited to the event by the president.
Mr. Parnas also posted a photo on social media in June of himself with Mr. Trump. In the post, he wished the president a happy birthday. "I am honored to call you Mr. President!!!" he said. "And my friend!!"
The same photo was shared in a since-deleted Facebook post a month earlier. In that post, captured by BuzzFeed News, Mr. Parnas said he and Mr. Trump shared an "incredible dinner and even better conversation" at the White House.
The two appear to have met even earlier. According to Politico, a photo from March 2014 shows Mr. Parnas and Mr. Trump together at an outdoor event. (CNN later identified it as a fashion show held at a golf tournament.)
In addition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman appear to have met with at least one other Trump family member. Another deleted post from May -- also documented by BuzzFeed -- showed Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman meeting with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have donated to Mr. Trump's campaign efforts
In late October 2016, not long before Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Parnas made a $ 50,000 donation to the Trump Victory PAC and contributed the maximum $ 2,700 to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to public records. He also gave more than $ 33,000 to the Republican National Committee.
Then, in April 2018, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman incorporated an energy-trading company named Global Energy Producers. Not long after, that company made major donations to political action committees supporting Mr. Trump and his political allies, including a $ 325,000 gift to America First Action, a Trump-affiliated super PAC.
Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman of hiding the origin of that donation and have charged them with falsifying records and lying to the Federal Election Commission.
According to the indictment, the two used their company to skirt campaign-finance reporting requirements and make illegal contributions. Prosecutors said in court documents that the company never engaged in energy trading.
The two men were associates of Mr. Giuliani, who was working on Mr. Trump's behalf
Last year, a company co-founded by Mr. Parnas -- Fraud Guarantee -- retained Mr. Giuliani for what Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times was legal and business advice. Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that he received $ 500,000 related to that work.
But Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman appear to have assisted Mr. Giuliani in other endeavors as well. Over the past year, the two men worked with Ukrainian officials and put Mr. Giuliani in contact with other people in the country as he sought damaging information about political rivals of Mr. Trump and his allies.
In May, The Times reported that Mr. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, helped plan a trip for Mr. Giuliani to that country. Mr. Giuliani wanted to meet with Ukraine's recently elected president and push him to launch investigations that might benefit Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, including one into the former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his son Hunter.
At the time, Mr. Parnas was portraying himself as a representative of Mr. Giuliani on the Trump-related matters. He also advised Mr. Giuliani on energy deals in the region.
Prosecutors have also connected Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to the effort to recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had been criticized by many of Mr. Trump's allies.
A lawyer argued the men's work for Mr. Giuliani might be covered by executive privilege
The professional relationship between Mr. Parnas and Mr. Giuliani is at the heart of the suggestion that materials in the case might be protected by executive privilege, which is the president's power to limit access to executive branch information about sensitive or confidential issues.
On Wednesday, Mr. Parnas's lawyer noted Mr. Giuliani had been retained by Mr. Trump and Mr. Parnas at the same time.
That raised the possibility that the White House might invoke executive privilege to protect some of the voluminous evidence in the case, the lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., said. It also meant, he said, that some of the evidence in the case was subject to attorney-client privilege, which preserves the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.
"These are issues we need to be very sensitive to," Mr. MacMahon told the judge. "I'm not telling you I know how to resolve this."
Earlier John M. Dowd, a lawyer representing Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman in the impeachment investigation, went even further, arguing that the two men had helped Mr. Giuliani on behalf of Mr. Trump, and so their work was covered by executive privilege.
At the time, the House committee directing the impeachment inquiry requested that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman testify and provide documents about their work in Ukraine for Mr. Giuliani.
They refused. In a letter to Congress, Mr. Dowd, who was once a lawyer for Mr. Trump, argued not only that Mr. Parnas's and Mr. Fruman's work for Mr. Giuliani was confidential under the executive privilege rule, but that, effectively, the two also had attorney-client privilege with Mr. Giuliani and possibly, by extension, with Mr. Trump.

Resumen: Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood. According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical. The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.

Texto completo: "Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" is a book made popular in the 1980s, but some are unaware of the play of the same name — or that it contains music. Judson University will present it at 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, Oct. 24-26, at Thulin Auditorium in Thompson Hall, on Judson’s Elgin campus, 1151 N. State St. Tickets are $5-$12.
The New York Times bestseller, written in 1986 by Robert Fulghum, has sold 7 million copies. Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood.
In 1992, Fulghum worked with David Caldwell, a composer and musical director, to transform the essays into a musical.
According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical.
"There are four songs," said Schmidt, an Elgin resident. "One song opens act one and closes act one, and the same with act two. It’s billed as a play with music, not a full on musical."
The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.
"It is a storytelling show in that each scene is complete in itself and tells its own story. It’s mostly one person telling the story and then other people come in an add to it," said Schmidt.
One of those bringing the story to the stage is Aneesah Phillips, a freshman at Judson from Bloomingdale.
"In one of the scenes, I play a kindergarten teacher," Phillips said. "In another, I’m a narrator, where I talk about a wedding that went terribly wrong at the last moment."
Phillips thinks people in all stages of life could look at the production as a refresher course in the basic life lessons that develop into road maps as time goes on.
"They seem to be simple lessons at first glance, but during troubles and facts of life we often forget they’re what we need," she said. "I think people of my age to 30 might benefit from this," adding that an older audience might find it insightful as well.
Schmidt said children will be entertained by the fast-moving vignettes.
"It’s totally family friendly," Schmidt said. "A child 8 or 9 (years old) would be able to enjoy it. The scenes are short, so they would be able to follow, pick up things and remember it."
"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" was not Schmidt’s first choice. There was another play set to be produced, but Schmidt decided on another path after the recent violence in El Paso and California.
"I thought, ‘I don’t want to do anything dark. I want something happy and uplifting,’ and came across this," she said.
"It’s a lot of fun. It ranges from stories where people will almost be falling off their chairs to poignant and wiping a tear or two," she added.
"I want to ... feel good that here are good people in the world and the things that really matter in the world (are) our friends, our family and good people."
Other cast members include Amir Scott, Lydia Alpert, Malina Sanchez, Rose Wodeck, Jacob Choate, Spencer Armstrong, David Larsen and Rachel Rosborough.

How the Democrats Will Keep Texas Red

Texto completo: Turning Texas blue has become the Democrats' Holy Grail -- and the media is eager to see them quest after it. "Is Texas finally turning blue?" asked the Washington Post. The New York Times answered by explaining "why Texas is nearing battleground status." Politico says it's already done: "Texas Republicans brace for 2020 drubbing."
The idea that Texas will vote Democratic next year mostly stems from the results of last fall's midterms. Democrats picked up two congressional seats and made gains in the state Legislature, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democrat Robert Francis O'Rourke by only 2.6 points. From this, many Democrats project a further inexorable decline in the Texas GOP's fortunes, flipping the state's 38 electoral votes blue.
Whoa there, pardner! That assumes Texas Republicans won't get their act together. They will. With Sen. John Cornyn (who leads the state ticket next year) and Gov. Greg Abbott (who vanquished his opponent last year by 13.3 points) focused on re-energizing GOP efforts to register and turn out voters, Republican complacency in Texas is the last thing Democrats can count on.
More important, Democrats will likely nominate a presidential candidate with a deeply anti-Texas platform on energy. Every major contender promises to end the use of fossil fuels within a decade or two -- or in former Vice President Joe Biden's case, three. "I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels," he said, "before 2050, God willing." If fulfilled, that promise would kill the prosperity of Texas.
On one energy issue, Mr. Biden is the only non-extremist of the bunch. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris all support a ban on fracking, the technological breakthrough that made the U.S. not only energy independent, but also the world's largest oil and gas producer.
Every major Democratic hopeful pledges to halt oil and gas leases on federal lands and in federal waters, with Ms. Warren promising to sign such an executive order on her first day as president. This would hit hard at the economies of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, where there's a lot of drilling on federal lands. While the only federal lands in Texas are parks and military bases, Texas companies are the biggest players in the Gulf of Mexico's federal waters. Ending drilling there would devastate Houston and southeast Texas.
Imagine the impact on Texas families if these policies are implemented. The oil and gas industry employs nearly 350,000 Texans, while 100,000 more work in refineries and chemical plants, earning higher pay than the state average. These roughnecks, welders, drivers, engineers, chemists and mechanics will react badly -- very badly -- to Democrats gunning for their jobs.
Zoom out a bit more. Wherever energy is pulled out of the ground, there are many others who work in construction, run cash registers, clerk at the bank, sell cars and wait tables who know the energy industry has given their communities a huge boost of prosperity in recent years. These Texans won't like Democrats vowing to end the use of fossil fuels, leaving tumbleweeds to roll down their towns' empty streets. That's the case not only in the West Texas oil patch, but also in East Texas and heavily Hispanic South Texas.
In the last fiscal year, the Texas oil and gas industry paid $14 billion in state and local taxes and royalties, including $1.2 billion to school districts and $366.5 million to counties. Royalty payments for drilling on state lands helped make Texas's Permanent School Fund, which supports K-12 public education, the world's largest educational endowment at $44 billion. Royalties to the Permanent University Fund are so large that, starting next fall, the fund will cover full tuition and fees at the University of Texas at Austin for all students from families with annual incomes of less than $65,000. If Democrats shut off the energy tap, more than jobs will be lost. This revenue will shrivel up, and so will its statewide benefits.
And for what? The U.S. has led the world in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in recent decades, mostly by using energy more efficiently and drawing more of its energy from less-carbon-intensive natural gas. So why should Texans pay for the failures of China, India, Russia and the rest of the world to match America's progress on climate?
Energy-state Republicans in red Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and North Dakota, as well as purple Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Mexico must now make a forceful case that the Democratic energy agenda strikes at the heart of their states' prosperity. If they do, Texas won't be all that's red in 2020.

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.
— Janice Hahn,
The letter writer represents the 4th district on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

Sen. Warren's debate anecdotes are dishonest

Texto completo: If you want to run for office, political consultants will hammer away at one point: Tell stories. People respond to stories. We've been a storytelling species since our fur-clad ancestors gathered around campfires. Don't cite statistics. No one can remember statistics. Make it human. Make it relatable. Lincoln told stories. FDR told stories. Reagan told stories.
Watching the Democrats' fourth debate Tuesday night, you could see the candidates implementing this advice. They'd mention Joe Blow in their state who said X, or Jane Blow who called their office with Y problem. They commonly use techniques like: "The voters I speak to aren't preoccupied with the elite concerns of Washington or New York. The voters I speak to are concerned about ..." and then the candidate fills in the policy he or she is touting.
That's OK, as far as it goes, but politics by anecdote should have some limits, because, as a wag once said, "The plural of anecdote is not data." Relying on anecdotes alone is how you get the anti-vaccine movement and other dangerous delusions. "I knew a little boy who was totally normal and chatty until he got the MMR shot and then he became autistic." That's tragic, but the data show that across large populations, there is no link between vaccines and autism. On the contrary, vaccines are a key public health benefit.
Politicians owe it to us to ensure that when they use examples, they are using them to illustrate larger truths, not to mislead.
Elizabeth Warren fails this test. For someone who touts herself as a scholar, she resorts to anecdotes in a most disingenuous fashion.
At the last debate, for example, asked to account for the cost of her "plan" to adopt "Medicare for All," which would eliminate the private coverage enjoyed by an estimated 150 million Americans, Warren proffered stories:
"So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.
"And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing."
Later, after asserting that only the wealthy and corporations would see their taxes go up under her plan, she cited the same anecdote: "And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, 'Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments; we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.' "
Is there a widespread practice of insurance companies rescinding coverage when people get serious illnesses? There are only two studies of the problem dating back to the early 2000s. One by the House Oversight and Investigations Committee found that three companies had rescinded 20,000 policies over the course of five years -- sometimes for fraud but in some cases for trivial reasons. All were policies purchased on the individual market, not through employers. Another study, by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, found that between 2004 and 2008, some 27,000 policies were rescinded out of 6.7 million individual plans surveyed. That translates to less than one-half of 1% of policies.
Does that mean it wasn't a problem? Not necessarily. Doubtless there were injustices -- serious ones -- when people found themselves facing a medical crisis and had their insurance canceled. But there's a reason that all of the data on this practice of rescission (which insurance companies claimed was fraud prevention) predate 2010. The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, explicitly outlawed it. As Healthcare.gov explains: "Under the Affordable Care Act, rescission is illegal except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan or coverage."
Warren surely knows this, and thus, her tales of people's insurance being withdrawn when they get sick are not illustrative examples of a serious problem; they are dishonest efforts to build a case for eliminating private health coverage. Elizabeth Warren, like Bernie Sanders, is an ideologue, enamored of government regulation of everything. Most Americans do not share her disdain for private health coverage. Eighty percent rate the quality of their care as excellent or good, and 69% rate their personal coverage the same way.
They deserve leaders who will not attempt to mislead them.

Texto completo: Turning Texas blue has become the Democrats' Holy Grail—and the media is eager to see them quest after it. "Is Texas finally turning blue?" asked the Washington Post. The New York Times answered by explaining "why Texas is nearing battleground status." Politico says it's already done: "Texas Republicans brace for 2020 drubbing."
The idea that Texas will vote Democratic next year mostly stems from the results of last fall's midterms. Democrats picked up two congressional seats and made gains in the state Legislature, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democrat Robert Francis O'Rourke by only 2.6 points. From this, many Democrats project a further inexorable decline in the Texas GOP's fortunes, flipping the state's 38 electoral votes blue.
Whoa there, pardner! That assumes Texas Republicans won't get their act together. They will. With Sen. John Cornyn (who leads the state ticket next year) and Gov. Greg Abbott (who vanquished his opponent last year by 13.3 points) focused on re-energizing GOP efforts to register and turn out voters, Republican complacency in Texas is the last thing Democrats can count on.
More important, Democrats will likely nominate a presidential candidate with a deeply anti-Texas platform on energy. Every major contender promises to end the use of fossil fuels within a decade or two—or in former Vice President Joe Biden's case, three. "I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels," he said, "before 2050, God willing." If fulfilled, that promise would kill the prosperity of Texas.
On one energy issue, Mr. Biden is the only non-extremist of the bunch. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris all support a ban on fracking, the technological breakthrough that made the U.S. not only energy independent, but also the world's largest oil and gas producer.
Every major Democratic hopeful pledges to halt oil and gas leases on federal lands and in federal waters, with Ms. Warren promising to sign such an executive order on her first day as president. This would hit hard at the economies of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, where there's a lot of drilling on federal lands. While the only federal lands in Texas are parks and military bases, Texas companies are the biggest players in the Gulf of Mexico's federal waters. Ending drilling there would devastate Houston and southeast Texas.
Imagine the impact on Texas families if these policies are implemented. The oil and gas industry employs nearly 350,000 Texans, while 100,000 more work in refineries and chemical plants, earning higher pay than the state average. These roughnecks, welders, drivers, engineers, chemists and mechanics will react badly—very badly—to Democrats gunning for their jobs.
Zoom out a bit more. Wherever energy is pulled out of the ground, there are many others who work in construction, run cash registers, clerk at the bank, sell cars and wait tables who know the energy industry has given their communities a huge boost of prosperity in recent years. These Texans won't like Democrats vowing to end the use of fossil fuels, leaving tumbleweeds to roll down their towns' empty streets. That's the case not only in the West Texas oil patch, but also in East Texas and heavily Hispanic South Texas.
In the last fiscal year, the Texas oil and gas industry paid $14 billion in state and local taxes and royalties, including $1.2 billion to school districts and $366.5 million to counties. Royalty payments for drilling on state lands helped make Texas's Permanent School Fund, which supports K-12 public education, the world's largest educational endowment at $44 billion. Royalties to the Permanent University Fund are so large that, starting next fall, the fund will cover full tuition and fees at the University of Texas at Austin for all students from families with annual incomes of less than $65,000. If Democrats shut off the energy tap, more than jobs will be lost. This revenue will shrivel up, and so will its statewide benefits.
And for what? The U.S. has led the world in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in recent decades, mostly by using energy more efficiently and drawing more of its energy from less-carbon-intensive natural gas. So why should Texans pay for the failures of China, India, Russia and the rest of the world to match America's progress on climate?
Energy-state Republicans in red Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and North Dakota, as well as purple Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Mexico must now make a forceful case that the Democratic energy agenda strikes at the heart of their states' prosperity. If they do, Texas won't be all that's red in 2020.

Texto completo: Netflix's new Shakespearean drama The King tells the story of an unwilling Henry V, played by Timothée Chalamet, who goes to war against a villainous French Dauphin (Robert Pattinson). While royal infighting and a muddy battle occupy much of the movie, another war rages in real life: who had the better hair?
Was it Chalamet, of whose circular chop co-star Joel Edgerton joked, "We put a breakfast bowl on his head and just went for it"? Or Pattinson, whose long, Elizabethan-surfer locks delighted fans more accustomed to his real-life close trim?
After Chalamet fans first saw his new hair while the actor was promoting Beautiful Boy, many expressed mixed feelings over the actor losing his shaggier chin-length bob. GQ called the new look "the bowl cut that broke a million hearts." When The King trailer debuted, a second wave of attention (and memes ) came with it. "Someone has to say it… Timothée Chalamet bowl cut lowkey hot?" read one tweet. "Timothée Chalamet's bowl cut is this year's Bradley Cooper's Jackson Maine's tan and beard," another user said of Cooper's disheveled outlaw makeover for 2018's A Star is Born that spawned many a Halloween costume.
The tweets about Pattinson's dirty blond waves were so numerous, multiple outlets posted round-ups . "*Storms into hair salon* GIVE ME THE ROBERT PATTINSON," joked the writer Anne T. Donahue.
When we first meet Prince Hal, his look is "almost Timothée as we know him—like a beautiful sex symbol," says Alessandro Bertolazzi, the Oscar-winning hair and makeup artist who created the actors' hair and previously worked on movies like Suicide Squad and Skyfall. Chalamet is initially wearing a billowing shirt with his long, unruly hair falling in his face. He looks like a 15th-century rock star. The team kept his existing, shaggy mop and put heavier product into it to evoke the pre-personal-hygiene era—but to mark Chalamet's official transformation into Henry V, Bertolazzi referenced paintings of the king at London's National Portrait Gallery. "When he arrives in his coat with his armor, with his beautiful haircut, he becomes stronger and more powerful," Bertolazzi says.
For Pattinson, a matching bowl cut wouldn't have been historically accurate. In 1415, the year the film's depiction of the Battle of Agincourt took place, France was already experiencing its Renaissance. Members of French royalty would likely opt for something more romantic, less severe. Plus, as the New York Times reported , Pattinson said he wanted to "play a princess, too," after seeing photos of his co-star Lily-Rose Depp as Catherine.
Bertolazzi experimented heavily. A braid was under consideration at one point, but deemed too much. When the actor put on the shoulder length, wavy blond wig he wears in the movie, they knew right away. "Sometimes if you do something really wrong, something you never expect to work, it can be amazing," says Bertolazzi. He then used soap and water to make the wig heavier. "Not too fluffy," he says. "You have to remember the Middle Ages were a dirty, sick period."
Bertolazzi says he's surprised by how much attention the hairstyles have received. "We're just following the rules about what the paintings show about the Middle Ages," he says. "Okay, it probably doesn't look so cool—but it has to be like that if you want to do something real."

Texto completo: With an aggressive forehand and an arsenal of lobs, drop shots and slices, he was one of Spain's most prominent tennis players and the oldest man to win a singles title at the French Open.
Andrés Gimeno, a lanky Spanish tennis player who in 1972 became the oldest man to win the men's singles championship at the French Open, died on Oct. 9 in Barcelona. He was 82.
The Spanish tennis federation said the cause was cancer.
A genial sportsman with a graceful style, Gimeno (pronounced hee-MAY-no) came to prominence in the 1950s, using an arsenal of drop shots and lobs that disrupted power players, especially on clay courts.
"Andrés didn't hit the ball with a lot of spin, like many Spanish players do now, but he had an aggressive, flat forehand, and a backhand that was more of a slice most of the time," Stan Smith, a frequent opponent of Gimeno's, said by phone.
By 1972, as he neared his 35th birthday, the closest Gimeno had come to winning a Grand Slam title was losing to Rod Laver in the final of the 1969 Australian Open.
Seeded sixth at the 1972 French Open, Gimeno defeated Smith in the quarterfinals, the Soviet Alex Metreveli in the semifinals and the Frenchmen Patrick Proisy in the finals. Gimeno won the championship match point with his lob -- his most potent weapon on that rainy June 4 at Roland Garros Stadium.
At 34 years and 306 days, Gimeno remains the oldest man to win the French Open men's title. The second oldest, Ken Rosewall, was 33 years and 220 days when he won in 1968.
Gimeno was born on Aug. 3, 1937, in Barcelona, where, with the encouragement and coaching of his father, Esteban, he began his path to a tennis career. He trained at a club in Barcelona and, at 17, won a national doubles championship with Juan Manuel. At 21, he played in the first of several Davis Cups for Spain.
After winning several amateur tournaments in Europe, Gimeno turned professional in 1960. He and other leading players, including Laver, Rosewall and Lew Hoad, played a circuit of pro tournaments but were not allowed to compete in Grand Slams like the French Open and Wimbledon because they were no longer amateurs.
But when the Open Era started in 1968, pros were allowed to play with amateurs. That year, in the first United States Open of the new era, Gimeno and Arthur Ashe lost in the doubles finals to Smith and Bob Lutz.
Six months later, Gimeno played Ashe in the finals at a tournament at Madison Square Garden.
"Strong, a retriever with classic stroking, Gimeno is the ultimate wall that returns everything," Robert Lipsyte wrote in his sports column in The New York Times. "He must be overpowered to be beaten." Although Lipsyte said that Gimeno was not especially exciting, "weekend players could probably learn more from him than any other leading professional."
Gimeno won the match and left Manhattan with a winner's check of $ 5,290.62 (the equivalent of about $ 38.000 today). He won several other tournaments in the United States and Europe through 1972.
In another strong performances at a Grand Slam before he won the French Open, Gimeno lost in the semifinals of Wimbledon to John Newcombe in 1970.
Gimeno retired in 1973 and became a TV commentator and coach and opened a tennis club in Barcelona. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.
Two years later, during the Spanish economic crisis, he said that he had lost nearly all his money. A group of Spanish players, including Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, raised money for him by playing in an exhibition tournament.
His survivors include his wife, Cristina Carulla; two sons, Andres Jr. and Alejo; and three grandchildren.

The President's Syria Trifecta

Texto completo: It's pure genius!
On the eve of the Iraq war, in 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain addressed a joint session of Congress about America's foreign policy mission: "In some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to but always wanted to go," said Blair, "there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happy, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, 'Why me, and why us, and why America?' And the only answer is, 'Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do."'
Blair is still right about the role that destiny has placed on America's shoulders, but years later it is also clear that many Americans are exhausted with that role.
After some four decades of a foreign policy built around "containment" of the Soviet Union, and then two decades of foreign policy built around "enlargement" -- enlarging the sphere of democracy around the world with the huge excess of power America enjoyed after winning the Cold War -- Americans want a break. President Trump is not wrong about that.
The job of the president, though, is to balance the understandable desire of Americans to no longer bear every burden and oppose any foe to ensure the survival of freedom with the fact that U.S. interests and values still require us to remain engaged around the world in a sustainable way.
But sustainable engagement requires us to do at least three things: make fine distinctions, leverage allies and amplify islands of decency. Alas, Trump violated all these principles in Syria.
First, Trump, and the U.S. military, missed the distinction between ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, and that's because Trump and the Pentagon had put the war on terrorism on autopilot.
How so? It was quite logical that after ISIS emerged in Iraq and Syria in 2014 that the U.S. would take on the mission of helping to destroy ISIS in Iraq.
Washington felt guilty having removed all combat troops from Iraq before it was really stabilized and ISIS had brutally murdered American journalists. But rather than do it all ourselves, we partnered with the Iraqi Army and amplified its power and ground forces with our advisers and air power.
That approach led not only to the defeat of ISIS in Iraq, it also produced some unanticipated positive effects in Iraqi politics. The ISIS war became a kind of national war of liberation for Iraqis that brought moderate Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds closer together -- and gave them dignity that the U.S. invasion of Iraq had unintentionally stolen. And this paved the way for more stable and sustainable power-sharing among Sunnis, Kurds and Shiites in Iraq.
Iraq today remains a very frail democracy -- with huge challenges in employment, energy, corruption and governing. But "Iraq today is a different country," noted Linda Robinson in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs titled "Winning the Peace in Iraq: Don't Give Up on Baghdad's Fragile Democracy. "Few Americans understand the remarkable success" that has been achieved in bringing Iraq back from the depth of the ISIS war.
This doesn't mean that the original Iraq invasion was worth it or that we would do it again. But it does mean we found the right way to help Iraqis help themselves. It is now up to them to make the most of it.
Unfortunately, we kept the war on ISIS on autopilot. Once Iraq was liberated we tried to produce the same result in Syria using Syrian Kurdish fighters. We failed to make some important distinctions, though. As I argued in a 2017 column, ISIS in Syria was operating in a completely different context than in Iraq.
In Iraq, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy. In Syria, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy, and so were Russia, Shiite Iran, Shiite Hezbollah and the Shiite-Alawite Bashar al-Assad regime. And they and ISIS all deserved one another.
"If we defeat territorial ISIS in Syria now," I wrote, "we will only reduce the pressure on Assad, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah and enable them to devote all their resources to crushing the last moderate rebels in Idlib, not sharing power with them." And that's basically what happened.
"ISIS was always two problems -- Syria and Iraq -- not one problem, and we should have treated them differently," explained John Arquilla, a professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. "In Iraq, ISIS had to be defeated, because once we broke Saddam's regime, Iraq would either emerge as a liberal counterweight to Iran" -- where power was stably shared among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds -- "or Iraq would become an Iranian puppet."
In Syria, though, Arquilla added, "we could have protected the Kurds" and forced the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah and al-Assad to have to keep ISIS bottled up there. But we were reflexive in just continuing the fight with ISIS into Syria, and not reflective."
In taking responsibility with the Kurds for defeating ISIS in Syria, we relieved Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and al-Assad of a huge burden, enabling them to crush the regime's domestic rivals. And what's really crazy is that -- we did it for free! We didn't even demand autonomy for our Syrian Kurdish allies or power-sharing with moderate Sunni Syrian rebels.
I feel terrible for the Kurds, but at least America might get the last laugh on Putin. Trump let Putin win Syria -- and the indefinite task of propping up al-Assad's genocidal regime and managing Iran's attempts to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel. What's second prize?
But even if you argue that walking away from the Kurds in Syria was the right coldblooded, strategic thing to do, how a president does things matters. By just pulling out of Syria without advance planning or coordination with our allies -- and dumping the Syrian Kurds after they sacrificed 11,000 men and women in the fight against ISIS -- we sent a message to every U.S. ally: "You'd better start making plans to take care of yourselves, because if Russia, China or Iran decides to come after you or bully you, America does not have your back -- unless you've paid cash in advance."
Watch out. Over time, that will not make for a more stable world or a cheaper U.S. foreign policy.
What makes America unique as a global power is that we have allies who share our interests and values -- and amplify our power at a low cost to us -- while Russia and China have only client states, like Syria, and customers.
"When we suddenly withdraw our support for an ally in one place -- with no warning -- we call into question our credibility everywhere," argued Michael Mandelbaum, author of the book "The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth."
That is not an argument for sustaining bad wars forever, he added, like Vietnam. But it is an argument for ending them in ways that don't unnerve your allies: "If the Germans and Japanese conclude that America's security guarantees are no longer valid, they will each get nuclear weapons -- which we don't want and they don't want."
Finally, most everyone now understands (I certainly do) that we don't have the time, patience, energy or know-how to create democracy in the Middle East. But what we can do and should do is amplify decency wherever we see it in hopes that the islands of decency there might one day connect up and flower into democracy.
For instance, Iraqi Kurdistan and the Syrian Kurdish regions, while they have plenty of corruption and tribalism, are nevertheless islands of decency where women tend to be more empowered, Islam is practiced in more moderate forms and Western liberal education is promoted in American-style universities. In just walking away from the Syrian Kurds, Trump has weakened their island of decency, rather than amplified it.
America is better than that, even if our current president is not.

Texto completo: The inventive revivals offered new ways to experience cherished classics of the musical theater canon.
Two boldly reimagined revivals of beloved American musicals -- a blood-soaked and bluegrass-tinged "Oklahoma!" and a "Fiddler on the Roof" performed entirely in Yiddish -- will end their acclaimed runs in January.
The "Oklahoma!" production, now at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theater, won this year's Tony Award for best musical revival, and also won a Tony for Ali Stroker, the actress playing Ado Annie, who became the first performer using a wheelchair to take theater's top prize. It will close Jan. 19.
"Fiddler" is an Off Broadway production, now running at Stage 42. It will close Jan. 5.
Both productions were praised by critics for offering new ways to see, hear and feel two of the most cherished works of the musical theater canon. The "Oklahoma!" revival emphasizes the violence and danger of an American frontier community, while the authenticity of the "Fiddler" revival reinforces its poignancy.
The productions were both successful in many ways, with humble beginnings that led to extended runs. Neither has yet become a financial success, but each production said it is hoping to recoup its capitalization costs through touring productions.
"Oklahoma!," directed by the avant-garde innovator Daniel Fish, had a first professional production in 2015 at Bard College's SummerScape festival, and then last year had a successful Off Broadway run at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn before beginning performances in March on Broadway, where the lead producer is Eva Price.
Its box office grosses have fluctuated, peaking at $ 651,744 during the week ending April 28; the show grossed $ 473,275 during the week that ended Oct. 20. Thus far it has been seen by 151,782 people and has grossed a total of $ 16.5 million, according to the Broadway League.
"There's a long future still ahead for Daniel Fish's groundbreaking production," said Ms. Price, who cited a 45-week tour that is scheduled to begin in Oklahoma City next fall, as well as "other international productions, currently in the planning stages."
The Broadway production and the tour were jointly capitalized for $ 8.5 million, Ms. Price said.
The production has not publicized a closing announcement, but has been advertising Jan. 19 as its final performance, and Ms. Price confirmed her intention to end the Broadway run at that point. The production was initially announced as a limited engagement through Sept. 1 and was then extended.
"Fiddler," directed by the Tony-and-Oscar-winning actor Joel Grey and deploying English and Russian supertitles, is a project of the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene, and began with a run last year at the Museum of Jewish Heritage before transferring in February to Midtown Manhattan, where the lead producers are Hal Luftig and Jana Robbins. The "Fiddler" production told the cast of plans to close on Tuesday.
"Fiddler" was capitalized for $ 2.6 million, and hopes to recoup those costs with national and international tours, including a production in Australia opening next September.
The first production of "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943, and the current production is the fifth Broadway revival. The musical, by Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers, depicts a love triangle set on a farm in Indian Territory in 1906, just before Oklahoma became part of the United States.
"Fiddler," featuring music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and a book by Joseph Stein, first opened on Broadway in 1964, and has been revived there five times. Set in a Russian village in 1905, it depicts tensions between tradition and assimilation -- personified by the concerns of a dairyman with five daughters -- in a shtetl imperiled by anti-Jewish violence.

The Democratic Primary's God Deficit

Texto completo: The candidates' reticence about religion is excessive and unwise.
The most recent Democratic debate lasted three hours and, according to one transcript I checked, exceeded 30,000 words.
Almost none of them were about religion.
God came up only in throwaway phrases. "God bless Kamala," said Cory Booker, praising Kamala Harris for discussing reproductive rights. Joe Biden scattered "for God's sake" and "God forbid" like croutons on his word salads. Tulsi Gabbard, explaining the meaning of "aloha," noted that "we're all God's children."
When Booker fleetingly mentioned his participation in a bipartisan Bible study group, I snapped to attention. That was the closest the debate came to acknowledging the importance of faith in many people's lives.
While the percentage of Americans who don't identify with any religion has grown significantly over the past decade -- to 26 percent from 17 percent, according to a sweeping survey by the Pew Research Center -- it's still the case that more than half of Americans say that they pray daily and 45 percent attend religious services at least once a month.
But you wouldn't know it to tune into the Democratic primary.
If many Republican candidates travel far out of their way, toward the bogs of histrionics and hypocrisy, to recruit the Almighty into electoral service, many Democrats steer clear of religion. That's partly understandable, even admirable: In light of the rightful separation of church and state, they don't want to be seen as spotlighting or peddling any one creed.
But it's not necessary, and it's not smart.
[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni's exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter. ]
President Trump and his Republican allies are poised to paint Democrats as unhinged lefties not only in terms of health care and taxes but also in terms of cultural issues, including abortion and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
And some Democratic presidential candidates are already playing into their hands. Beto O'Rourke, for example, recently seemed to call for religious groups that don't support marriage equality to lose their tax-exempt status, an outlier position that the president immediately seized on and railed against. (O'Rourke's aides later insisted that he was misunderstood.)
Democrats would make it harder for Trump to vilify them as enemies of so-called traditional values if they talked a bit more about spirituality and religion -- including, if applicable, their own.
That might not matter in the bluest parts of the bluest states, said Mike McCurry, a Democratic consultant who served as the White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton and now teaches at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. But, he added, "I sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that's what it's all going to come down to."
The church-state divide shouldn't dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. "That's such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is," he said. "We have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning."
Besides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: "Think ahead to the general election. If you're talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you're running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary." While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.
And he's vulnerable not just because of his personal history and public demeanor, which amount to a raging bonfire of the pieties. He also has governed in ways that contradict the principles of charity and mercy that are central to many religions.
Pete Buttigieg took gorgeously effective note of this in the Democrats' first debate, in June, referring to the Trump administration's treatment of migrants at the border.
"The Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion," he observed. "But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it." And any political party that suggests that "God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents -- that God would condone putting children in cages -- has lost all claim to ever use religious language again."
Buttigieg, a churchgoing Episcopalian, refuses to cede religion to Republicans or let them use it as some crude moral cudgel. He weaves it into discussions of his marriage to another man. "Nothing has made me feel more connected, more able to be true, however imperfectly, to my faith than the experience of putting myself second," he said at a CNN town hall this month. "That came with committing my life to my husband, Chasten."
He's not the only Democratic presidential candidate with religion in his history and on his mind. He's just unusual in his readiness to mention it.
In the Democratic debates, Elizabeth Warren, a Methodist, has repeatedly reflected on her past as a teacher. But she has never taken the few extra syllables to note that she taught Sunday school.
In terms of connecting with as much of the electorate as possible, that's a mistake. And in terms of the president's nonexistent moral fluency, it's a blown opportunity.

Texto completo: An anonymous writer described as a senior Trump administration official whose op-ed piece in the New York Times last year caused a firestorm has written a book called "A Warning" slated to hit bookshelves on Nov. 19.
The publisher, Twelve, an imprint of Lagardère SCA's Hachette Book Group, described the book as "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency."
The op-ed piece , which ran in September 2018, was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration." In the essay, the author said that he wanted the administration "to succeed" but added that "the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic."
After the op-ed was published, President Trump described the author as "gutless" and called on the Times to "turn him/her over to government at once!" The White House repeatedly urged the Justice Department to launch a probe to identify the writer.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twelve said in a news release that the author didn't receive an advance for the book and that the author intends to "substantially" donate any royalties to nonprofit groups that "focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world." The publisher said the author would continue to remain anonymous.
Javelin, a literary agency in Alexandria, Va., sold the book on behalf of the author to Twelve. It couldn't be learned whether the author is still working in the Trump administration. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on any aspects of the author's identity.
One bookseller said he had already placed a major order for the forthcoming book but that it was too early to predict how it would sell.
"We haven't been given any information," said Bradley Graham, co-owner of the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C. "We just can't tell at this time how much of a splash it will make without knowing more about what it will say."

Main Street: All Hillary's Russian Assets

Texto completo: Ever since Hillary Clinton suggested Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian "asset," the Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii has been on the attack. But she ought to consider the remarks an in-kind contribution. Because before Mrs. Clinton's ham-handed insertion of herself into the 2020 Democratic race, Ms. Gabbard's campaign for president was going nowhere.
The big challenge before Ms. Gabbard now is whether she will make it into the next Democratic debate on Nov. 20 in Atlanta. She has yet to meet the polling requirements: either 3% support in four Democratic National Committee approved national polls, or 5% in two DNC-approved polls from states with early primaries (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada).
Ms. Gabbard has had trouble cracking 2% in most polls, and her debate performance last Tuesday hasn't moved the needle. A FiveThirtyEight.com analysis put her at the bottom of the pack of all the Democratic candidates who made it to the stage, and noted her postdebate net favorability had dropped further into negative numbers.
Nor is her alleged stooging for Moscow Democrats' only issue with Ms. Gabbard. In her call to bring the troops home, many hear echoes of Donald Trump; her support for a ban on third-trimester abortions breaks with the party's abortion absolutism; notwithstanding an apology, her past opposition to same-sex marriage has led to charges of homophobia; and her threat to boycott last week's debate after alleging its corporate sponsors (CNN and the New York Times) worked with Democratic Party officials to "rig" the election had the Times writing how her political contribution was "injecting a bit of chaos" into the race.
Enter Mrs. Clinton. Speaking Thursday with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe for his "Campaign HQ" podcast, Mrs. Clinton offered that Ms. Gabbard is a tool of Moscow. Though she didn't mention her by name, the reference was unmistakable:
"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Mrs. Clinton said. "She's a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far."
Mrs. Clinton went on to say that Jill Stein, who ran in 2016 on the Green Party ticket, is "also a Russian asset." She later said she meant the Republicans were grooming the third-party candidate, but the use of the word "also" to describe Ms. Stein as a Russian asset shows that isn't true.
Call it Hillary Classic. Start with an outrageous charge, backed with zero evidence, against a combat veteran who still serves as a major in the Army National Guard. Use an interview about the 2020 election to try to settle an old score, in this case Ms. Gabbard's 2016 resignation as vice chairman of the DNC and her endorsement of Bernie Sanders after she'd complained publicly the party was limiting debates, which was thought to favor Mrs. Clinton. Finally, yet again blame your loss to Mr. Trump on the Russians rather than accept that you were a lousy candidate.
Ms. Gabbard minced no words in response. She launched a tweetstorm that began, "Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain."
On Sunday she escalated. In a video she accused Mrs. Clinton of a "new McCarthyism" and asked for help in taking back the party from Mrs. Clinton and "her rich and powerful friends." "If they can falsely portray me as a traitor," Ms. Gabbard warned, "then they can do it to anyone."
It's making for interesting bedfellows. Most Democratic defenses of Ms. Gabbard have come from the minor candidates, such as Beto O'Rourke and Marianne Williamson. They are also coming from Republicans. At his cabinet meeting Monday, President Trump declared that Mrs. Clinton believes "anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent."
Some anti-Trumpers are coming to her side as well. Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who recently left the GOP, tweeted that whatever else may be unclear, "the thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset." Meanwhile the Associated Press ran a story Monday with the headline, "Tulsi Gabbard elevated in Iowa by Clinton spat."
This week will probably tell whether Ms. Gabbard's nuclear response to Mrs. Clinton will give her the boost in polling she needs to get herself into the next Democratic debate, or whether their dispute will merely give conservative radio something to chew on for the next few days. But if the controversy does elevate her to the next debate, it won't be just Tulsi Gabbard on that stage in Atlanta. With her will come a question on which almost all her fellow candidates would rather pass: About the high price the party continues to pay for Hillary Clinton and her fantasy that all her electoral troubles came from Russian agents.

Texto completo: The senator acknowledged that he had an account, which he used to monitor political conversations online and defend himself.
Mitt Romney, the senator from Utah, former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker "Pierre Delecto."
Mr. Romney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It's unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.
Several events preceded the admission.
First, The Atlantic published on Sunday a profile of Mr. Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.
Mr. Trump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a "pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning." In one tweet, the president used the hashtag "#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY."
In the Atlantic profile, Mr. Romney admitted to having what he called a "lurker account" -- essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation. But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.
The admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.
Slate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Mr. Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.
Slate's Ashley Feinberg found that Pierre Delecto's first follower was Mr. Romney's oldest son, Tagg. The account was created in 2011, shortly after Mr. Romney announced his intention to run for president. The account also followed all of Mr. Romney's children who are on Twitter and several former advisers, according to Slate.
The account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private on Sunday night.
In one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Mr. Romney's strategy on Mr. Trump was "non-confrontation verging on spinelessness."
"Jennifer, you need to take a breath," Pierre Delecto replied. "Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure."
The Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Mr. Romney, he had concocted one of the most extraordinary pseudonymous social media accounts for a public official ever (besting the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey's onetime moniker of Reinhold Niebuhr).
After Slate published its article, Mr. Coppins circled back with Mr. Romney to ask if he was indeed "Pierre Delecto."
"Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto," Mr. Coppins said in a tweet. "His only response: "C'est moi."'
A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney did not directly answer questions about the account on Sunday night. But in an email, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Mr. Coppins describing Mr. Romney's admission.

No More 'Marshall Plans'; When America rebuilt Europe, it also built a pernicious cliché.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposes a "Green Marshall Plan," which would lend $100 billion to foreign governments to purchase "clean" energy products made in the U.S. Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, wants "a 21st century 'Marshall Plan' for Central America." Columbia economist Glenn Hubbard likens President Trump's $50 billion Mideast peace plan to the Marshall Plan.
It's time to stop with these latter-day Marshall Plans. As the only nation-rebuilding effort perceived to have been successful, the 71-year-old plan has become the go-to association for policy entrepreneurs everywhere. Without substantive detail—almost invariably absent—these neo-Marshall Plans are sure to fail.
Appeals to the Marshall Plan cloak designs for massive government spending. No matter the cause's worth, no matter the plan's feasibility, this analogy provides an easy off-the-shelf sales pitch.
The real Marshall Plan of 1948 provided grants and loans to speed Europe's economic recovery after World War II. Although named for Secretary of State George Marshall, the plan's real author was Will Clayton, an international financier and former cotton trader. Debate persists about whether the Marshall Plan was motivated by humanitarian concerns, self-interest or anti-communism. To varying degrees, it was all of the above. Although scholars quibble about the plan's effectiveness and context, the American public remembers it as a triumph. But many forget why it succeeded—not merely due to its ambition or price tag but, critically, because of good political and economic institutions in recipient countries.
The Marshall Plan often resurfaces in periods of crisis. In 1958 Bruno Kreisky, a socialist who went on to become chancellor of Austria, proposed a "Marshall Plan for the Third World." In 1999 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed for a "Marshall Plan for the Balkans."
After 9/11, proponents of aid to Arab countries turned to the analogy. "The security of the United States now depends upon achieving throughout the Arab and Islamic World what the Marshall Plan achieved in Europe," wrote Richard Sokolsky and Joseph McMillan in the New York Times. President George W. Bush invoked the Marshall Plan while spending $20 billion to reconstruct Iraq after the 2003 invasion, and liberal critics like Susan Rice argued it wasn't generous enough.
More recently, the musician Bono proposed a Marshall Plan for refugees in 2016. Commentators writing everywhere from Bloomberg to the Jakarta Post have implausibly christened the $575 billion Belt and Road Initiative "China's Marshall Plan." Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has trumpeted a $30 billion "Marshall Plan" for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The original Marshall Plan's success now confers instant legitimacy on knockoffs of dubious merit. Without regard for accountability, administrative concerns, loan default, corruption, oversight, appropriate measures of success, or recipient-country history, all of these counterfeit Marshall Plans risk building up only one thing: the federal deficit.

With toxic Kyrie gone, Celtics spin positive outlook

Texto completo: The Celtics were big-time underachievers last season. Presumed front-runners to get to the NBA Finals, they feuded and fumbled all season. As they staggered into the spring, toxic Kyrie Irving told us not to worry. He told us we would see the real Kyrie and the real Celtics in the playoffs.
We did. In Round 2 of the playoffs, Kyrie stunk up the gym and the Celtics got pantsed in a feeble five games against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Mud on their face . . . big disgrace . . . dishonoring championship banners all over the place.
And then they got worse. Lyin' Kyrie took his talents and goofiness to Brooklyn. Al Horford, one of the few adults in a room of child prodigies, bolted for Philadelphia where he thinks he can play for a true contender. Marcus Morris went to the Knicks. Terry Rozier and Aron Baynes were traded.
Despite all of the above — despite a 6-foot-8-inch starting center (Daniel Theis) who seems to have been delivered from the NBA of the 1950s — we are hearing the message that everything is awesome in Celtics land. They are the Hakuna Matata Five once again. They may not have as much talent, the ceiling may be lower, but you are going to love these guys. This is the Green Team narrative.
At the Shamrock Foundation Gala on Thursday at the Westin Waterfront, Celtic co-owner Steve Pagliuca told the crowd, “This is the most positive and uplifting team I have seen in my 15 years."
Swell. But is this feel-good vibe grounded in hope or reality? Pags was here in 2007-08 when the Celtics went to Italy for preseason camp with newcomers Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. That team was built on “Ubuntu" and blitzed to the NBA championship, wiping out the vaunted Lakers, 131-92, in a sixth and deciding game on the Garden parquet. Can this 2019-2020 team really be more “uplifting" than that?
I dove into the Globe clips to recall exactly how bad things were here in mid-May when the Celtics were humiliated by the Bucks. There was a lot going on in Boston sports during those days. Half of the members of the world champion Red Sox visited with President Trump, while almost all Sox players of color boycotted. The Bruins were finishing up with the Colum­bus Blue Jackets en route to the Stanley Cup Final. The Patriots were claiming to have had the best draft since Red Auerbach made off with Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones in 1956. There was crazy talk about the Celtics maybe trading for Anthony Davis.
The Celtics never had a chance for Davis, of course. But they did make a deal for 6-foot guard Kemba Walker and Walker is now being asked to drive the Green bus into the new decade.
Everybody loves Walker. He is the anti-Kyrie — also shorter and less accomplished. But he is lovable the way Isaiah Thomas was lovable.
This worries me. Isaiah was a wonderful talent, but the Celtics were never going anywhere with him as their best player. We don't need another little engine that could.
It worries me that Walker teamed with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart on the 2019 Team USA squad that finished seventh in the ­FIBA Basketball World Cup. They could not beat France. And now we need them to beat the Sixers, Bucks, Clippers, and Lakers? Walker will have the ball in his hands all the time, but if the Celtics are going to contend they need Tatum and Brown to be their best players and they need Gordon Hayward to return to the form that made him an All-Star in Utah. These guys won't have Kyrie to kick around anymore. Time to step up.
The Celtics are going to have trouble with interior defense. Horford, Baynes, and Morris were their paint defenders. Now we are going to see a steady diet of Theis and Enes Kanter. Look out below. Who is going to guard Joel Embiid when the Celtics open their season Wednesday in Philadelphia?
The Green Team is projected to finished third in the Eastern Conference with about 48 wins. That might be generous. The Sunday New York Times had the Celtics finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division, just ahead of the woeful Knicks.
The 2019-2020 Celtics will be more fun to watch than last year's edition. And easier to coach. They will play team-above-self basketball. They will possibly exceed expectations and the same fans who regularly torch the Red Sox and Bruins will be happy.
Once again, the franchise that's won a single championship in 33 years will operate noise-free in a town that can be brutal toward its teams.
When it comes to the Boston Celtics, optimism always trumps reality. It's a Green Team thing.

No, We Won't Just 'Get Over It'

Texto completo: We dare not fail this test of our constitutional government.
For weeks Donald Trump and his defenders have insisted that his decision to hold up aid to Ukraine was not dependent on that nation investigating Trump's political opponents in the United States. They all insisted that there was no quid pro quo.
But, last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, lifted the veil on that lie, confirming during a televised briefing that there was indeed a quid pro quo. As The New York Times reported, "Mr. Mulvaney told journalists ... that the aid was withheld in part until Ukraine investigated an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016 -- a theory that would show that Mr. Trump was elected without Russian help."
Since making this shocking statement, Mulvaney has been struggling to clean it up, to tell the world that he didn't say what he clearly said.
And, in the moment of making the statement, Mulvaney proudly proclaimed: "I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy."
No, Trump world, we are not just going to get over it, not now or ever.
Trump's strategy is simple: Be brazen. Conduct your corruption in plain sight. And, it follows a simple logic: If it were wrong, I would be ashamed of it and attempt to conceal it. The fact that I haven't attempted to shroud it is proof of its virtue.
That is what's maddening about the Trump presidency: how much harm has been done as America looked on, with full awareness of the damage, and Trump has yet to be held accountable for any of it.
But that time is drawing to an end.
Wrong is wrong, whether you parade it or put it away. In fact, it is the flaunting of wrongdoing that should carry more of a penalty, not less of one. We can't allow our numbness to make this normal. It isn't.
This impeachment inquiry is the best thing Congress has done to help the country in years. Some worry that an impeachment would tear the country apart. To the contrary, I believe that it will bring the country together. A majority of Americans will recognize and rally around a common set of facts, a common truth, and reject Trump's attempt to bend reality.
A Pew Research Poll released last week found that 58 percent of Americans, including a quarter of Republicans, believe that Trump has done things that are grounds for impeachment.
No matter how much he says that the call he made to the president of Ukraine was perfect, no matter how much he attacks the whistle-blower, no matter how much he lies, most Americans see through it and are appalled by it.
And now that Mulvaney has made the disastrous mistake of actually telling the truth, some Republicans are even signaling that they are open to at least entertaining a vote to impeach the president.
This is another step that is important to the repairing of the country. It's not that I believe that the Senate would be in any danger of actually voting to convict and remove Trump. It's that we need to know that at least some of these Republican men and women who make our laws are not totally craven and devoid of morality.
And, Republicans and independents need to know that holding Trump accountable is not a sour grapes pursuit to relitigate 2016, or born out of maddening personal hatred of the man himself.
This is far bigger than all that. Trump is a stress test on our system and constitutional government and we dare not fail. Trump must be held accountable not only because his corruption dictates it, but also because we must demonstrate that accountability is possible.
If Americans chose to just "get over it" as Mulvaney demanded, the power of the president to degrade, corrupt and evade the system would be enshrined. Trumpism would mar the future.
That can't happen. Trump wrongdoing in the Ukraine case is clear. (I would argue that it's clear in other areas as well.)
Republican Congressman Francis Rooney of Florida made it clear that he's not ruling out the possibility of supporting impeachment. Sunday on CNN he told Jake Tapper that Mulvaney's attempt to walk back his admission was a farce, saying: "I don't see how you walk back something that's clear. I would say game, set, match on that."
And, as The Washington Post reported:
"Rooney told reporters Friday when asked about the political consequences of potentially impeaching Trump that he wanted 'to get the facts and do the right thing because I'll be looking at my children a lot longer than I'm looking to anybody in this building.' "
Each of us will have to look at our children, to look at ourselves in the mirror and be held accountable for how we responded to the threat Trump poses.
As the late Elijah Cummings put it:
"When we're dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?"

Texto completo: To many people, Anthony Bourdain was more than a chef. He was a world traveler and storyteller with a passion for music, watches and art spanning all cultures and regions. Bourdain admirers can now take a glimpse into his diverse life interests at Savannah's Everard Auctions and Appraisals.
Located at 2436 Waters Ave., the auction house has 10 items on display from Bourdain's personal collection that are part of the Property from the Collection of Anthony Bourdain, a 215-piece online auction hosted by Lark Mason Associates through iGavel Auctions.
"The objects are stories in themselves and they tell a lot about his life and in them sending us a group of these items they tried to represent different areas," said Amanda Everard, president of the Savannah auction house.
The items on display at Everard include several cufflink sets, sunglasses, an African carved wood figure, Ralph Steadman print, Jacques Pepin painting, tribal pigmented wood mask, a Verve cardboard record case with a collection of vinyl records, Latin American carved wood figure of a pre-Colombian warrior and a Tom Ford tuxedo.
"He really enjoyed things that were well-made and had a story to them," Everard said.
The online auction runs through Oct. 30 and is divided into categories that reflect Bourdain's wide variety of interests: film, art, cooking, travel, writing and world culture.
Some of the highlights of the overall collection include a custom steel-and-meteorite chef's knife crafted for Bourdain by master bladesmith Bob Kramer. As of Thursday, the knife was the highest-priced item with a leading bid of $21,000.
"He also used it and that was the cool thing. He didn't just have objects around that he wasn't going to enjoy and use," Everard said of the knife, which is on display in New York.
Other notable items include a chrome duck press from the Paris episode of Bourdain's show "The Layover," which aired from 2011-13 on Travel Channel, with a bid of $9,250. A group of early writings by Bourdain includes the original idea for his New York Times best-selling book "Kitchen Confidential," which has a bid of $4,100. A white chef's jacket worn by Bourdain for a cameo in the film "The Big Short" is listed for $1,300.
If you can't spare thousands of dollars for a bit of Bourdain history, there are several items, including an Alfred Brown blazer, Tom Ford suit and various pieces of furniture, that as of Thursday were listed for under $200.
"It's a little bit of everything. He was such an interesting guy," Everard said.
"The objects that were chosen to be sold really tell his story, and he was a great storyteller. That's what drew us all in."
For Everard, a pair of silver skull cufflinks that is being sold alongside another pair of silver disk cufflinks stands out among the pieces on display at the auction house.
"They're so persona," she said of the cufflink set, which has a current bid of $950.
"Things that you wear on your person, it says something. It's sort of a glimpse into the person."
All items from the collection, including the ones on display in Savannah, can be bid on at igavelauctions.com through Oct. 30. You can view the 10 items at Everard by appointment through Oct. 25 or at a public viewing scheduled for Oct. 28-30.
"We feel really lucky to be the ones here who get to take this on and bring it to people here locally," Everard said of Bourdain's collection.
"Because he traveled and was so famous he was given hundreds of things over the years, so the things that actually made it into his home are things that he cared about and they meant something to him."
A portion of the auction's proceeds will benefit the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, the Culinary Institute of America. The scholarship was established to support students pursuing a semester abroad or taking part in one of the college's global cuisines and cultures international programs.
The remaining proceeds will go to Bourdain's estate. Bourdain died in 2018 in Paris. He was 61.

Texto completo: In Tallahassee, in the early 1940s, one might have heard Glenn Miller's "In the Mood," or Frank Sinatra crooning a love ballad on the radio. But, if you were in the right place you might have heard Julian Adderley and his brother Nat playing the saxophone and cornet live.
Julian Adderley Jr., or "Cannonball" as he was professionally known, was one of our most famous jazz musicians. He got there by having great parents, a solid education, and checking all the boxes along the way such as a stint in the Army and as a high school teacher.
Early Tallahassee While he was born in Tampa in 1928, Julian's family moved to Tallahassee when he was young. His father, Dr. Julian Adderley Sr., and his mother, Jessie, were educators and had obtained teaching positions at Florida A&M University. As a cornetist himself, Dr. Adderley instilled a love of music in his sons Julian Jr., and Nat.
By the time Julian was 14, he was playing with his own band at local venues in the historic Frenchtown section. By one account, he played with the great Ray Charles here before either were known.
After graduating from FAMU in 1948, Julian became a high school band director at Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale. Uncle Sam called in 1950 and he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he became the leader of the 36th Army Dance Band.
The Big Apple With his military service over, he moved to New York City in 1955 planning to pursue graduate studies in Manhattan. However, one night his destiny changed after finding his way into the famous Cafe Bohemia in Greenwich Village accompanied by his brother Nat, a cornet player like their father, and was asked to sit in for the band's regular saxophonist.
The Cafe Bohemia was considered the mecca for finger-snapping jazz and progressive music conception. At the end of the evening, the manager called out to Nat "Who is that guy?" Nat shouted back, "Cannibal!" which was a nickname he had been given because of his ferocious appetite. The manager misunderstood and introduced him as "Cannonball" to the jazz patrons. The name stuck.
Shortly thereafter, he began to be referred to as the next Charlie Parker, who died earlier the same year, and was later immortalized in the movie "Bird" directed by Clint Eastwood.
Not unlike most musicians, Cannonball was involved with different bands performing with other fledgling performers such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Sarah Vaughan for the next few years. Along the way, he made his coast-to-coast television debut on NBC's the Tonight Show, hosted by Steve Allen, in July, 1956.
Performing with Nat In September 1959, Cannonball reunited with Nat and formed the Cannonball Adderley Quintet. The quintet recorded live one month later at the San Francisco Jazz Workshop and became an immediate success. For the next 16 years the quintet performed in venues all over the country.
Cannonball's personality also played a role in making the band popular. He loved to interact with the audience with commentary that explained the music. According to the New York Times, he once said, "I prefer nightclubs to concert dates because I dig the sound of laughter, the murmur of the crowds and that cash register – there's something Freudian about the ringing of a cash register. I feel that when people pay to hear music, I owe them something."
One of Cannonball's most famous record albums was "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! Live at the Club" recorded in 1966 and received the Grammy Award for the best instrumental jazz performance in 1967.
Cannonball recorded 55 hits as the band leader, seven with his brother Nat, and 25 with other greats such as Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, and Miles Davis.
Back home Even after becoming nationally known, he took time to return to Tallahassee to perform at FAMU's Lee Auditorium in February, 1957 at a benefit for a fraternity scholarship fund. Tallahassee was his home. Though widely traveled, he visited his family often. First at their home on West Pensacola Street, where the FSU law school is now, and later on Young Street near FAMU campus.
Sadly, Cannonball passed away after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while performing in Gary, Indiana on Aug. 8, 1975 at the age of 46. He is buried in Tallahassee at the Southside Cemetery.
At the beginning of my senior year at Leon High School we had a new guidance counselor, Dr. Julian Adderley. I was a saxophone player, albeit a bad one, so he was like a god.
On the few times I interacted with him I was completely in awe and could barely speak. He was an experienced educator, used to dealing with kids, so instead of just staring at me like I had two heads he gently coaxed the responses he needed.
Cannonball, you are remembered and missed. You did us proud!

Texto completo: Love is in the air
Rom-coms may be an endangered species in theaters, but the genre is alive and kicking in "Modern Love," a new anthology series based on the long-running New York Times column. Watching glamorous stars like Andy Garcia, Tina Fey and Dev Patel flirt and fight to coffeehouse music can get a little precious, but even curmudgeons will be forced to smile when Anne Hathaway leads a musical number in a grocery-store parking lot.

Paul Rudd does double duty in "Living With Yourself," an unpredictable new dramedy about a sad-sack advertising executive who may lose his wife (Aisling Bea) to his peppier 2.0 version, manufactured in a strip mall. Rudd offers a master class in subtle acting, differentiating his competing characters with the teeniest adjustments in posture and turns of the mouth, but the eight-part series works only because Bea is so properly flustered by a bizarre version of the Dating Game.

"This isn't the 'Price Is Right!' " bellows a member of "Impractical Jokers," whose members chime in as advisers. No, it isn't.

Trump in tailspin — and dragging country down with him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The most powerful office in the world is occupied — and being abused — by a man who is entirely unfit and is spinning dangerously out of control. Everyone needs to stop pretending otherwise.
And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom. “I pray for the president all the time ... I think now, we have to pray for his health,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later, because “this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.”
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts. The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
Trump then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9. Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, “Let's work out a good deal!” It ends by telling Erdogan, “History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.”
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
At the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate James Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is “the world's most overrated general,” Trump announced, according to The New York Times. “You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.”
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS — the Islamic State — was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives. Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354-60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Perhaps that vote was what set Trump off. “You're just a politician,” he told Pelosi. Then he amended his assessment: “You're not a politician, you're a third-rate politician.”
That's what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York heard; Pelosi thought she heard him say “third-grade politician.” In any event, she and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer rose to their feet and walked out.
They pressed Trump and his aides to explain what the plan was for fighting the Islamic State now that the Kurdish firewall is gone. They didn't get an answer because there is no plan. The president doesn't have the foggiest idea what he is doing.
Trump is in so far over his head that he doesn't know which way is up. He also is intellectually, psychologically and morally unsuitable for the high office he holds. Those two problems — incompetence and unfitness — reinforce each other, in the worst possible way, and have sent the presidency into a tailspin that puts the nation and the world in mounting peril.
Impeachment is no longer optional, given what we already know about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. But the prospect of facing a Senate trial — for which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is already making plans — can only boost Trump's anxiety. His outbursts and tweetstorms are becoming more frequent and less tethered to the world of facts, events and consequences. Madness is a term laypeople use, not doctors. We must use it now.
I once was confident that our institutions and processes were durable enough to easily survive Trump. Now, I'm less sure. “Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!” — a letter saying these things, on behalf of the United States government, was actually sent to the government of Turkey. Good lord.
Senators, pay attention. You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election. But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Marc Thiessen: Warren’s message is not working for ordinary Americans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That’s great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
A Marist poll asked voters whether “the economy is working well for you personally.” Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters. So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South. So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters. Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is “part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,” it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that “over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases.” Americans don’t just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday’s debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on Earth would Americans rally to her call for “big structural change” to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and — whether she admits it or not — would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren’s proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. “Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,” Riedl says. And that’s before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There’s no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren’s wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday’s debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump’s policies but don’t like Trump. They can’t do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will “repeal the filibuster,” she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump’s message — “whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me” — will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Texto completo: The Celtics were big-time underachievers last season. Presumed front-runners to get to the NBA Finals, they feuded and fumbled all season. As they staggered into the spring, toxic Kyrie Irving told us not to worry. He told us we would see the real Kyrie and the real Celtics in the playoffs.
We did. In round 2 of the playoffs, Kyrie stunk up the gym and the Celtics got pantsed in a feeble five games against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Mud on their face . . . big disgrace . . . dishonoring championship banners all over the place.
And then they got worse. Lyin' Kyrie took his talents and goofiness to Brooklyn. Al Horford, one of the few adults in a room of child prodigies, bolted for Philadelphia where he thinks he can play for a true contender. Marcus Morris went to the Knicks. Terry Rozier and Aron Baynes were traded.
Despite all of the above — despite a 6-foot-8-inch starting center (Daniel Theis) who seems to have been delivered from the NBA of the 1950s — we are hearing the message that everything is awesome in Celtics land. They are the Hakuna Matata Five once again. They may not have as much talent, the ceiling may be lower, but you are going to love these guys. This is the Green Team narrative.
At the Shamrock Foundation Gala Thursday at the Westin Waterfront, Celtic co-owner Steve Pagliuca told the crowd, “This is the most positive and uplifting team I have seen in my 15 years."
Swell. But is this feel-good vibe grounded in hope or reality? Pags was here in 2007-08 when the Celtics went to Italy for preseason camp with newcomers Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. That team was built on “Ubuntu" and blitzed to the NBA championship, wiping out the vaunted Lakers, 131-92, in a sixth and deciding game on the Garden parquet. Can this 2019-2020 team really be more “uplifting" than that?
I dove into the Globe clips to recall exactly how bad things were here in mid-May when the Celtics were humiliated by the Bucks. There was a lot going on in Boston sports during those days. Half of the members of the world champion Red Sox visited with President Trump, while almost all Sox players of color boycotted. The Bruins were finishing up with the Columbus Blue Jackets en route to a Stanley Cup Final. The Patriots were claiming to have had the best draft day since Red Auerbach made off with Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones in 1956. There was crazy talk about the Celtics maybe trading for Anthony Davis.
The Celtics never had a chance for Davis, of course. But they did make a deal for 6-foot guard Kemba Walker and Walker is now being asked to drive the Green bus into the new decade.
Everybody loves Walker. He is the anti-Kyrie — also shorter and less accomplished. But he is lovable the way Isaiah Thomas was lovable.
This worries me. Isaiah was a wonderful talent, but the Celtics were never going anywhere with him as their best player. We don't need another little-engine-that-could.
It worries me that Walker teamed with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart on the 2019 Team USA squad that finished seventh in the FIBA Basketball World Cup. They could not beat France. And now we need them to beat the Sixers, Bucks, Clippers and Lakers? Walker will have the ball in his hands all the time, but if the Celtics are going to contend they need Tatum and Brown to be their best players and they need Gordon Hayward to return to the form that made him an All-Star in Utah. These guys won't have Kyrie to kick around anymore. Time to step up.
The Celtics are going to have trouble with interior defense. Horford, Baynes, and Morris were their paint defenders. Now we are going to see a steady diet of Theis and Enes Kanter. Look out below. Who is going to guard Joel Embiid when the Celtics open their season Wednesday in Philadelphia?
The Green Team is projected to finished third in the Eastern Conference with about 48 wins. That might be generous. The Sunday New York Times had the Celtics finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division, just ahead of the woeful Knicks.
The 2019-2020 Celtics will be more fun to watch than last year's edition. And easier to coach. They will play team-above-self basketball. They will possibly exceed expectations and the same fans who regularly torch the Red Sox and Bruins will be happy.
Once again, the franchise that's won a single championship in 33 years will operate noise-free in a town that can be brutal toward its teams.
When it comes to the Boston Celtics, optimism always trumps reality. It's a Green Team thing.

POLITICS: Trump-backing PAC opts not to go all in on Georgia 6th: Despite longtime GOP ties, 6th looks ever less Republican.

Texto completo: Lucy McBath entered Congress after winning a tight race in 2018 over then-U.S. Rep. Karen Handel. Only 1.02 percentage points separated McBath and Handel in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, a matter of 3,264 votes.
Conventional thinking would say McBath, a Democrat from Marietta, is in for another tight contest, possibly a rematch with Handel.
But what does the big money say? There may be safer bets.
America First Policies, a political action committee that supports Republican President Donald Trump, has announced a $1 million campaign -- using television and Facebook ads, plus text messages--to pressure 28 "swing legislators on an impeachment vote." A majority of the money will go toward the Facebook ads and text messages to spur voters to call their representatives in Congress, including McBath.
But TV will be the most high-profile part of the effort, and when it comes to McBath, America First is saying maybe later. It's aiming its TV ads at three other Democratic lawmakers, U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, now serving his fourth term in the U.S. House; U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer of Iowa, who first won election in 2018; and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former CIA spy and another first-term member of Congress.
That's not to say McBath hasn't faced pressure on impeachment. Trump supporters have demonstrated outside her Sandy Springs office. Others have gathered there to stage counterdemonstrations.
America First's decision, however, may be less a comment on McBath than it is on the 6th District. Despite its longtime ties to the GOP, having been represented in Congress by the trio of Newt Gingrich, Johnny Isakson and Tom Price, the 6th is looking less and less Republican.
Age and level of education are now among the most significant factors in determining U.S. elections, and in the 6th District, they trend well for Democrats. The district is younger and better-educated than Cartwright's, Finkenauer's and Spanberger's districts.
The youngest of the three targeted districts is Finkenauer's Iowa 1st, where 26.4%of the population is over age 54. In the 6th District, 25.5% of the population falls in that category.
The real difference is education. The best-educated of the targeted districts is Spanberger's Virginia 7th, where 40.5%of its residents age 24 and over hold at least a bachelor's degree.
That's no contest for the 6th District, which has the sixth-highest level of education in the country, with 63.5% of its residents age 24 and over possessing a bachelor's degree or better.
That's something for the smart money to consider.
Cancel with care: This past week's Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, spotlighted that state's canceling of voter registrations, a topic familiar to many Georgia election officials.
Court rulings in Ohio have been cited in Georgia cases because both states take a "use it or lose it" approach in removing "inactive" voters from voting lists. Georgia removed more than 1.4 million voter registrations from 2010 to 2018, while Republican Brian Kemp, in his role as secretary of state, was Georgia's top elections official. It becameanissuelastyearwhen Kemp ran successfully for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams.
Proponents say the cancellations are necessary to remove voters who have died or moved. Critics say the policy is overly broad, affecting voters who often don't know about their unregistered status until Election Day.
The New York Times looked at how officials in Ohio addressed the critics' objections.
"This year," the Times wrote, "a group of elected officials in the state, mostly all moderate Republicans, tried to answer the concerns with an experiment of their own: Rather than purge the voter rolls behind closed doors as had been done in the past, the government released the full list of those to be removed this summer, and gave the list to advocacy groups. The groups said they found the list was riddled with errors.
"The result:Around 40,000 people, nearly one in five names on the list, shouldn't have been on it, the state determined. And it only found out before anyone was actually turned away at a polling place largely because of volunteer sleuthing."
Georgia eased its voter regulations somewhat during this year's legislative session.
Under House Bill 316, the same legislation that authorized the purchase of new voting machines for the state, voter registrations cannot be canceled for inactivity for eight or nine years, two years longer than under the previous state law. Also, voters must be mailed a notification 30 to 60 days before their registrations are canceled.
A victory for Hice: When the U.S.House voted this past week to curtail federal benefits provided to former U.S. presidents, it marked a win for U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Monroe.
Hice sponsored the measure, which would limit the former presidents' future pensions, the annuities provided to surviving spouses and their annual allowances.
"In recent years, former presidents have had no shortage of lucrative opportunities upon leaving office," Hice said when he introduced the bill earlier this year. "Despite this, taxpayers are still footing the bill for the official expenditures of former commanders in chief."
The bill was a bipartisan effort, and its co-sponsor was U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. Hice had tangled in the past with Cummings, who led investigations into Trump's activities as chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Cummings died the day after the presidential pension bill won House approval.
The bill now goes to the U.S. Senate, where companion legislation was proposed by U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.
Trump gets Abrams wrong: Trump once wrote in a tweet that Abrams "will have a terrific political future!"
But based on what he says about her on the campaign stump, he doesn't seem to know her too well.
Abrams came up repeatedly during a recent Trump event in Louisiana. The president referred several times to last year's campaign for governor between her and Kemp. He got a lot wrong. Here are a few of the biggest errors:
|Trump said that, while Abrams had "every
star"Democrat rally to her side, "all Brian Kemp had was Donald Trump." Maybe it's a matter of what Trump considers to be a "star," but several big-name Republicans came to Georgia to back Kemp. That included Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence.
|The president also said he attracted "55,000 people at that rally" for Kemp at an airport outside of Macon the Sunday before the election. Kemp's campaign disagreed. It put the attendance closer to 10,000 people.
|Finally, he said Kemp won the race by 2.5 percentage points. His math was a little off. Kemp won by less than 1.5 percentage points in Georgia's closest race for governor in decades.

Nike Puts a Spring In Runners' Steps. Is It Too Much?

Texto completo: The people who oversee track and field have to give serious thought to how much running-shoe technology is too much.
Last weekend's extraordinary marathon performances -- 1 hour 59 minutes 40 seconds by Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna and 2:14:04 by Brigid Kosgei in Chicago -- have focused attention on an already simmering question: Does the International Association of Athletics Federations need a more stringent rule to define legal running shoes?
It appears that running, the original and most elemental of sports, now faces the same tradition vs. scientific innovation challenge that other sports have encountered. Think: tennis rackets, baseball bats and, perhaps most similar, competition swimwear -- those polyurethane-based suits that were banned starting in 2010. The outcome of the current running-shoe debate could affect everything from stock prices of global footwear companies to who wins the Olympic marathon in Japan next summer.
Kipchoge, who became the first person to run the 26.2-mile distance in under two hours, and Kosgei, who set a women's world record, raced in a revolutionary and bizarrely tall Nike shoe that has taken the marathon world by storm since 2016. In the last 13 months alone, male runners in the Nike shoes have recorded the five fastest marathon times ever. Other running-shoe companies are struggling to catch up, and may face patent hurdles.
The current I.A.A.F. rules state only that shoes may not confer an "unfair advantage" and must be "reasonably available" to all. The rule does not explain how these two values can be measured.
This week, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published a commentary that is likely to guide the debate. In it, Geoffrey Burns, a 2:24 marathoner and University of Michigan doctoral candidate in biomechanics, argued for "a single standard in competition running shoes: regulate the shoe midsole thickness."
With the right material, a thicker sole produces more spring. Without clear restrictions, it is likely only a matter of time before someone comes up with a way to make a shoe with more powerful springs.
Burns called for an upper limit of 31 millimeters -- about 1.2 inches -- of midsole. Nike's current Vaporfly 4% and Vaporfly Next% shoes have a 36-millimeter midsole, or about 1.4 inches. Why 31 millimeters? That's a fairly common midsole height for previous models.
Until 2016, marathon racing shoes were constructed from thin slabs of rubber. In 1960, an Ethiopian runner named Abebe Bikila even managed to win the Olympic Marathon in his bare feet. Everyone understood that less was more; you ran more efficiently when you carried minimal weight on your feet.
In 1968, when shopping for the shoes that carried me to victory in that year's Boston Marathon, I had only two criteria. They had to be light and thin, and they had to be cheap. I was still in college. I paid $ 9.95 for my lucky shoes -- a pair of Onitsuka Tiger TG-4 Marathons.
Little changed in the footwear for elite marathoners in the next five decades, until Nike introduced its Vaporfly 4% shoes in 2016. These shoes contained a new midsole foam, Pebax, so lightweight that it is almost like running barefoot. Pebax also delivers 30 percent more energy return than the foams used in most running shoes since the 1970s. This allows Pebax to function almost like leg muscles, but without the fatigue that can debilitate the legs after 20 miles.
The Nike shoes also include a carbon fiber plate in the midsole. This plate might increase energy return, or it might improve foot function during the running stride. Either way, the plate is prominently mentioned in Nike's patent application.
Nike-supported experts soon published papers in scientific journals showing that the Vaporfly shoes could improve marathon times up to 3 percent. That sounds small until you consider it is often the difference between a gold medal and a quickly forgotten fifth-place finish.
The results were so astounding, in fact, that some considered them as just another example of Nike sports marketing.
"I was skeptical at first, but then came the second and third and fourth report," said Ross Tucker of the Science of Sport website. "I had to change my skepticism. Now I think the effect is real, and large."
A 2018 New York Times data analysis based on public race results uploaded to Strava, the athlete-tracking and networking company, found that runners in Vaporflys ran 3 to 4 percent faster than similar runners wearing other shoes.
To be fair, Kipchoge, 34, is an otherworldly talent who has beaten the best in the world in last-generation shoes. There probably isn't another marathoner who could break two hours in the shoes he wore last weekend.
(When I was with Runner's World, I traveled to Kenya with a group from the magazine in 2005. Our dozen or so runners met with Kipchoge's training group one day high in the Great Rift Valley. My wife wanted to get in a few miles, despite the altitude and a hilly course. I sheepishly asked the Kenyan runners if anyone was willing to run at a 12-minute-per-mile pace with us. Kipchoge stepped forward, an easy smile on his face, and did four miles with us.)
Still, the I.A.A.F. acknowledges that it has a problem, especially with the Tokyo Olympics coming up fast. In a statement, it said, "It is clear that some forms of technology would provide an athlete with assistance that runs contrary to the values of the sport." The group has appointed a technical committee to study the shoe question, and make a report in the next two months.
Not every fast marathoner wears Nike shoes. Jared Ward finished sixth in the 2016 Olympic Marathon, and ran 2:09:25 in April in the Boston Marathon. When Ward lines up at the New York City Marathon in two weeks, he'll be wearing Saucony shoes, as he has for years.
But not ones you can find at your local shoe store. Ward has been working with the biomechanist Spencer White, Saucony's vice president for human performance, to design a shoe that is, well, a bit like the Vaporfly. Ward believes they have succeeded. "My new shoes feel so good that I know I'm ready to compete well in them," he said.
Nike is well known in the patent world for its large and increasingly frequent applications. It also has plenty of lawyers, though no one can say what might happen in any patent infringement case until it is litigated.
White said he would be unhappy if the I.A.A.F. tightened its shoe regulation policies. "We could end up limiting creativity and losing the chance to improve running shoes for the everyday runner," he noted. "I think the 'must be widely available' part of the rule is the best answer."
Tucker's view is more in line with Burns's. "The solution is very simple," Tucker said. "Limit the stack height" -- which is the midsole height -- "and ban the addition of springlike devices in the midsole."
Burns would not even go that far. "I don't want to ban anything," he said. "We can do most of what needs doing with a simple midsole-height limitation. My fear is, if we don't do this, in a few years we might end up with footwear that we don't even recognize as shoes."

Texto completo: Her novels, short stories and poetry were dense with lush and spellbinding imagery. As a teacher, one former student said, "She lived and died by the word."
Kate Braverman, a brash and theatrically dramatic writer whose novels, short stories and poetry were dense with lush and spellbinding imagery, died on Oct. 12 at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 70.
Her daughter, Gabrielle Goldstein, said the cause was cardiac arrest.
Outspoken and outrageous, Ms. Braverman brought a ferocious energy to books like "Lithium for Medea" (1979), with their focus on women on society's margins.
"Ms. Braverman possesses a magical, incantatory voice and the ability to loft ordinary lives into the heightened world of myth," Michiko Kakutani wrote in her New York Times review of "Palm Latitudes" (1988), a novel about three women in a Los Angeles barrio, including La Puta de la Luna, the most famous prostitute in the neighborhood.
"The night will be as all others, treacherous, studded with disguised traps and graves," Ms. Braverman wrote of La Puta. "She will survive it. There will be gold and the danger of barter with strangers, foreigners with metallic mouths of invisible eaten coins and greed, with mouths that are miniature replicas of the city, voids, empty, less than mud or clay, which are fundamental."
Ms. Braverman -- who struggled with addictions to cocaine in the 1970s and '80s and to heroin in the 1990s -- found purpose in writing. It was more than a mission; it was a mystical conjuring that brought her characters to vivid life. Stories, she said, revealed themselves to her on the page in an almost cinematic fashion.
"It's not a flat surface but three-dimensional, with an audio track, scents, seasons, an entire substrata of sound and cadence," she told Bella Online, a women's publication, in 2018, in explaining her attraction to writing. "The page is a unique kingdom, vast, mysterious and eccentrically indigenous. It's like a dance, you do some and it does some. To have the page open itself, to shed its skin and allow you to autopsy the living and the dead, is an inexplicable experience."
She harbored no doubts that her fiction had elevated her into an exalted place in literature beside men like Saul Bellow, Joseph Conrad, Philip Roth, Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer.
"I should not be compared to other women," she said in 2006 in an interview on "San Francisco/unscripted," a local television show. "I do not write or live like a woman. I'm a complete outlaw in my sensibility and in my demand that women be given total access to the page, which they are not."
But, she conceded, "Sylvia Plath, 50 years later, is still not really in the canon because she dared to complain about the 'smog of cooking, the smog of hell."'
Kate Ellen Braverman was born on Feb. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia. Her mother, Millicent (Glubt) Braverman, co-owned a public relations agency, and her father, Irving, was a contractor. The family moved to Los Angeles when Kate was a child.
Kate envisioned herself as a writer from a young age and joined a writing workshop at U.C.L.A. when she was 15. When she was 16 she left home for Berkeley, where she attended high school. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor's degree in anthropology. (She earned a master's in English from Sonoma State University in the 1980s.)
In 1971 she moved back to Los Angeles, where she was a founder of the Venice Poetry Workshop. Returning to her adopted hometown reignited feelings of alienation, loneliness and loathing for the city that she described, in a 2006 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, as a "gulag with palm trees."
She felt like a permanent outsider in Los Angeles, which she said lacked an intellectual community that recognized or appreciated her. She told The Chronicle, "I was continually having to translate myself into a local dialect that I barely spoke."
Yet she stayed there, writing more stories, poems and novels, including "Wonders of the West" (1993) and "The Incantation of Frida K." (2001), an imagined memoir of the painter Frida Kahlo, looking back at her life on her sickbed.
Reviewing the Kahlo book for NPR, the novelist Alan Cheuse said, "As with Kahlo herself, women are Braverman's great subject, but she also riffs in remarkably beautiful passages on the nature of cities and on the effects of drugs."
She became a writing teacher at the U.C.L.A. Extension Writers' Program and, in the 1990s, held workshops at her home. Her students included Janet Fitch, the author of the novel "White Oleander" (1999), and Samantha Dunn, the author of the novel "Failing Paris" (1999).
In phone interviews, both women described a high-octane and uncompromising teacher who inspired them to add propulsive power to their work. But they also said she could be tough on the students; some of them, Ms. Fitch said, wept in their cars outside Ms. Braverman's house after being criticized.
"She lived and died by the word," Ms. Dunn said. "If you were writing anything less than incendiary prose, you weren't living up to the challenge of the word."
Ms. Fitch recalled: "Her voice is constantly in my head. When something was particularly well phrased, she'd go, 'Yum, yum,' and when I write, I sometimes say, 'Yum, yum."'
Nearly 20 years after her last class, Ms. Dunn received a letter from Ms. Braverman that reminded her of her unyielding approach to literature.
"You thought writing a reasonable profession," Ms. Braverman wrote. "You thought you could wear linen and gloves. You didn't realize the habitual hazards of this art form, the contagious derangement, the exposure and subsequent addiction to toxins, the delirium of thirty hours in stark communion with a self that is insatiable for discovery."
She left Los Angeles for Alfred, N.Y., in 1995 with her second husband, Alan Goldstein, and her daughter. But after about seven years there in western New York, she moved again, to San Francisco, with Mr. Goldstein. There she found an artistic community that she felt was more welcoming to her than Los Angeles had been.
In 2006, she published "Frantic Transmissions to and From Los Angeles: An Accidental Memoir" (2006), which looked back at her life in the city she had long reviled.
Her publisher, Graywolf Press, awarded her its first nonfiction prize for that book, but she refused to accept it because, she said, the book's ending had been censored.
She accepted other honors, including an O. Henry Award in 1992. In 2004 she received the Raymond Carver Editor's Choice award and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation Fellowship.
Ms. Goldstein, her daughter, is her only immediate survivor. Her marriages to Donald McKenzie and Mr. Goldstein ended in divorce.
Ms. Braverman moved to Santa Fe about a decade ago. Her short-story collection "A Good Day for Seppuku" was published in 2018.
"Braverman pressurizes psychic landscapes into heated fields of organic matter, glowing or rotting," Katy Waldman wrote in her review of that book in The New Yorker.
Michael Clark, a longtime friend, said that a year ago Ms. Braverman told him that she was no longer writing. That retirement appeared to last less than two weeks.
"She was a dynamo and kept on writing, no matter what," Mr. Clark said by phone. "She called me 10 days ago and said, 'I have to stop, I've finished a draft and I'm exhausted."'

Women of a certain age, making their mark

Texto completo: Being a woman of 50 or more has always been a kind of drag, really. We keenly understand that we are invisible in public unless we have enormous fame that surrounds us like an omnipresent picture frame, or are muttering loudly on the street. Yet being, um, older (and there is always that "um") can allow a woman the freedom to be herself and enjoy what is left of her life.
I'm being serious. For succor, I recommend Gail Collins's new book, "No Stopping Us Now," subtitled, "The Adventures of Older Women in American History." Collins, an opinion writer (and formerly the first female editorial page editor) at the New York Times, is a cheerful companion through the decades. Right from the introduction, the reader understands Collins's point of view: A woman can be kind, intelligent, hard-working and successful, but we're always going to wonder if she's coloring her hair, or has gained or lost a little weight. Nevertheless, there are dozens upon dozens of heroic stories of remarkable women in this book that will be new to the average reader. And though you may already be an expert on Eleanor Roosevelt, I was not, and thus I could be surprised by Collins's take that, as she traveled nonstop, speaking and writing on all manner of important issues, Roosevelt "was possibly having the most extraordinary middle age of any woman in American history."
This is a history book, a sprightly one. But since it begins in 1630, the narrative starts on a grim note. Middle-aged women were likely to have gaping holes in their gums where their teeth used to reside. (Personally, I'm pretty convinced that I would have died from a hit-and-run horse, as I can barely see without my 20th-century inventions, contact lenses.) Life in the early years of our country saw few comforts, and sadly one often outlived several of one's own children. Medical treatments were limited to bloodletting, homemade remedies and sometimes opium.
You recall from your American history class long ago that independent-thinking women in the pre-Revolutionary War years might be taken for witches. An Englishman visiting the colonies in 1646, Collins writes, "deplored the way in which 'every old woman with a wrinkled face, a furr'd brow, a hairy lip, a gobber tooth, a squint eye, a squeaking voice, or a scolding tongue . . . is not only suspected but pronounced for a witch."
With that warning, if women wanted to pretty themselves up they had to be rich enough to use the family bacon. I mean this literally, as Collins explains that applying bacon to one's face was said to prevent wrinkles. However, in most communities, makeup and hair dye were shunned as misleading, dishonest and reflecting the bad character of a woman trying to fool a man into marrying her.
Most women didn't have many or any career options. However, once they had launched all their children and ditched the housework, many older women won respect - the old-fashioned way. They were midwives and ministers, writers and editors. Take for instance, the author of "The Frugal Housewife," Lydia Maria Child, whose story is woven throughout these pages. She was perhaps the first-ever influencer, and though female, she traveled the country spreading her opinions on matters of dress, decorum and stain removal. (Child had another hit in 1865 with "Looking Toward Sunset," a meditation on aging.) One gets the impression that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries women were crisscrossing the country giving "talks" in parlors and auditoriums, telling their fervid audiences how to be.
One thing they could not be was too youthful. It was deceitful and unseemly. Collins quotes the author Robert Tomes, who wrote "The Bazar Book of Decorum": "Old people of the best breeding now seldom resort to the hair-dresser to refurbish their shattered and decaying frames." Since many evenings in town involved going to parties with dancing, the old people were best served - according to society - by sitting quietly in a corner, cognizant of their own obvious decline. When lovely, healthy, married women were seen enjoying themselves, well, that was almost vulgar. "To dress cheerfully and becomingly is considered as an attempt to affect youth; to converse gaily an unsuitable effort to attract admirers. There is really no limit to the ungracious things said," complained the married Caroline Kirkland.
The painful adherence to beauty standards that created the corset and later the girdle gets its due in Collins's history. Although a Brooklyn gynecologist in 1910 suggested that it was dangerous for women to wear corsets, around the same time an editorial in Harper's Bazaar suggested that eliminating this item of "foundation" would be regrettable for the older woman: "an ill-advised experiment . . . if she wishes to look neat and trim and well-groomed."
In the 1920s, youth was a queen in a short flapper dress. "The whole nation got the idea: the younger generation intended to live life full-force and, of course, never get old." The amount of fabric needed to make the average woman's outfit had dropped from a voluminous 19 1/4 yards to a trim seven yards. Americans now had movies and movie stars to emulate, as well as beauty and fashion magazines filled with ads. Collins writes that there were 7,000 beauty products on the market by 1927, and the ads she quotes are harshly phrased, terrorizing their customers into buying their wares. Naturally, corsets were required for the modern silhouette. And they continued to be worn, though they were harder to buy, during World War II, when rubber was needed for the war effort. Women were urged for the first time to locate their abdominal muscles and exercise them to flatten their tummies if the manufacturing of these foundations were to take a hiatus. (Women complained. There was a backlash, and the government rethought a restriction on sales, deciding that girdles were helpful to the many women working in factories.)
"No Stopping Us Now" devotes much more time and space to politics and good works. From America's first female senator, Jeannette Rankin of Montana, to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, American women devoted themselves for years and years to winning the vote and equality under the law. Women were the trailblazers of the civil rights movement as well. Many of the pioneering women we used to read about - Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Addams, Alice Paul, Carrie Chapman Catt and others - were the mothers of both movements, some starting settlement houses for the poor.
We gals have made a ton of progress over the 389 years covered in Collins's book. We may one day even conquer the White House. But my favorite story belongs to Frances Willard, a leader of the temperance movement, whose interests included suffrage and "health reform." Willard learned to ride a bicycle at the wobbly old age of 53 and then wrote about it: "The most remarkable, ingenious and inspiring motor ever yet devised upon this planet." She became a devoted cyclist and advocate for the exercise and the experience. The year was 1895.

Texto completo: It's never the wrong time to do the right thing.
Everyman Theatre is showing Radio Golf, the final play in renowned playwright August Wilson's 10-play opus, 'The American Century Cycle.' Radio Golf brings the "crackle of a comedy with old-fashioned melodrama," according to the New York Times, and highlights the challenges faced by modern-day African Americans straddling the line between monetary success and cultural assimilation.
The play opened Oct. 15 and runs through Nov. 17 at Everyman Theatre, located in the up-and-coming Market Center District of Downtown Baltimore. This is the fourth August Wilson production from Everyman, after Fences (2002 and 2015) and Gem of the Ocean (2008). The Harlem Classical Theatre's Associate Artistic Director Carl Cofield makes his Everyman directorial debut with this play.
Radio Golf tells the story of Harmond Wilks, played by Jamil Mangan, a young African-American real estate developer running for Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1997. He opens a campaign office in the heart of Pittsburgh's Hill District, his childhood neighborhood that's fallen into disrepair.
Together with his business partner Roosevelt, played by Jason B. Mcintosh, and wife Mame, a resident company member Dawn Ursula, Harmond's grand plan to develop a neglected block in order to erect a high-rise apartment complex - complete with a Whole Foods and Starbucks - is challenged by two members of the Hill community, Sterling, played by Anton Floyd, and Elder Joseph Barlow, played by Charles Dumas. Harmond must face his uncovered past and weigh the impact and true costs of his personal progress if he chooses to ignore his heritage and legacy.
"Although Radio Golf is set in 1997, August Wilson saw into the future and started this conversation around life in America for upper-class Black folk," Director Carl Cofield said. "How important is success if you're denying and destroying your family's history and culture in order to get it? It's a modern examination of what the American
Dream means today, and has huge resonance in Baltimore and other urban centers."
Because the themes of neighborhood revitalization and cultural crossover directly affect both the Market Center, Bomo area, and Baltimore at large, Everyman is hosting multiple events that will engage community partners and begin to breach these topics in order to start a dialogue between neighbors and engaged Baltimore supporters. These include a neighborhood cleanup day and community panel discussions.
"We specifically chose to bring Radio Golf to Baltimore because of the mirror it holds up to our neighborhood and how it reflects some of the greatest challenges that Baltimore faces today," says Everyman Founding Artistic Director Vincent M. Lancisi. "August Wilson is one of the most revered playwrights of our age. His legacy of chronicling the American century decade by decade has left us with a treasure trove of great stories. Radio Golf is one that is immediate, relevant, and funny all at the same time."
Radio Golf runs from Oct. 15 - Nov. 17 and you can purchase your tickets online at everymantheatre. org, by phone at (410) 752 -2208, or at the Everyman Theatre Box Office at 315 W. Fayette St., Baltimore, Md.

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: News Corp reached a deal to let Facebook Inc. feature headlines from The Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones media properties, as well as the New York Post, in the social-media giant's news section, the companies said.
Other publications that have agreed to participate include the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider, people familiar with the matter said. The New York Times has been in talks with Facebook, but a spokeswoman for the paper declined to comment on whether it had reached a deal.
The deal, for which News Corp will be paid a licensing fee, presented some obstacles due to the Journal's digital subscription business model, people familiar with the matter said. Now that the issue has been settled, the way is cleared for the product to launch as early as the end of the month. Financial terms weren't disclosed.
The licensing fees Facebook is offering range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for smaller publishers to a few million for bigger ones, and substantially higher than that for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with the matter.
"People want to see high-quality news on Facebook," said Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive. "I'm excited we'll have the opportunity to include award-winning journalism from The Wall Street Journal [and other U.S. News Corp properties] in our news tab."
Facebook has sought to include news from about 200 different publications, although it is offering to pay only about a quarter of the news organizations that will be involved, people familiar with the matter have said.
The News Corp arrangement would allow headlines from properties in its Dow Jones unit, including the Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Financial News and Mansion Global, as well as the New York Post, to appear in the Facebook news section, linking to the publications' sites.
For nonsubscribers, links to Journal stories that are behind the site's paywall would trigger a prompt for the reader to sign up.
Certain headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be curated by editors, while others will be selected by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said. The "Top News" section will feature about 10 headlines selected by human editors. Subsections such as sports or entertainment and a "suggested for you" section will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising, the people said.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news.
"Facebook deserves credit for recognizing the principle of journalistic provenance," News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said Friday. "Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high-quality journalism has a viable, valued future."

ONLY IN THE AJC STONE MOUNTAIN: Street with KKK link slated to be renamed

Texto completo: As a little girl, before the roads were paved, Lydia Shumake made a lot of happy memories on a street that bore a controversial name.
For decades, her aunt and cousin's home in the city of Stone Mountain bordered Venable Street, named for the family that used to own Stone Mountain and had strong ties to the Ku Klux Klan, according to archives and records. Venable Street runs for four blocks through Shermantown, the historically African American part of the city of Stone Mountain, where Shumake often visited her family while growing up.
Spearheaded by members of the Shermantown community, a push to counter the negative stigma that accompanies the Venable name has gained steam in recent months. The Stone Mountain City Council is set to vote Nov. 7 to rename Venable Street to Eva Mamie Lane -- named after Shumake's aunt and cousin, Eva Jewell Greene and Mamie Ella Lane.
The mother and daughter were considered pillars of the Stone Mountain community, known for their outreach efforts, the leadership-based organizations they founded and the charity they provided to those in need. Greene died in 2006 at age 85, and her daughter died earlier this year at 77.
"My aunt and my cousin have given their lives and made an impact for that community," Shumake said. "It shows it's a new day coming in Stone Mountain, that they're getting rid of all that negativity."
'We have moved forward'
The name change would rename the entire length of Venable Street, which is less than half a mile long on the east side of the small city. From the corner near where Greene and Lane lived, the top of Stone Mountain is visible above the trees.
It's unclear exactly when the street was named and whether it was named after a specific member of the Venable family. Brothers William and Samuel Venable previously owned Stone Mountain, which they used as a granite quarry. They gave the Klan permission to meet at the mountain, where the group staged a cross burning and "rebirth" in 1915, according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives.When the Venables sold the property to the state in the 1950s, it was designated to become a memorial to the Confederacy.
Decades later, James Venable became the Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Klan for nearly 25 years -- a fact noted in his obituary that ran in the New York Times. He was also a mayor of Stone Mountain, using the nearby land for annual Klan rallies, newspaper stories stated.
Shermantown residents remember seeing the KKK march through town in the 1960s on its way to the mountain.
"We would have to get in the house,"Shumake said. "We would have to hide down on that floor."
Residents and leaders in Stone Mountain -- which is now about two-thirds black -- said changing the street name is a way to shed the negative stigma that accompanies the city's history. The past links to hatred and racism, they said, do not represent the welcoming and diverse spirit of the city today. It also follows a pattern in communities across DeKalb County of reckoning with past acts of racism and highlighting the positive contributions of African Americans.
"This will help people to see the positive side of what has happened in the community," said Vivian Moore, a longtime family friend who treated Greene as her own mother. "And how much we have moved forward."
Paving the way
Eva Jewell Greene and Mamie Ella Lane were not elected officials, and their names probably do not ring a bell for most metro Atlanta residents. But in Stone Mountain and the surrounding neighborhood, they were leaders and organizers.
Many remember the mother-daughter duo for the outreach organizations they founded and led: the DeKalb Economic Opportunity Authority, the Stone Mountain Negro Civic League, the DeKalb Neighborhood Leadership Institute and the Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger.
The family lived in a modest one-story home next to a building that Greene's husband, Henry, used as a shop and grill. In 1963, Lane turned the building -- at the corner of Venable and Third streets -- into the House of Bethel Prayer Chapel. There, she held prayer groups every Tuesday and did outreach ministry.
The two women were strong community advocates. Family and friends say Greene, whom many called "Mother Greene," helped to eventually get the roads paved in the neighborhood. Around Shermantown, they used their personal relationships to help their neighbors, often opening up their home to people who needed a place to stay.
"This is where my aunt did most of her prayer teaching and studying," Shumake said while cleaning out her aunt and cousin's old living room. The home, built in 1933, is still packed with books and fine china.
She remembers visiting here during the summer, on weekends or on holidays. She loved her aunt's biscuits and rolls, eating them around the dining room table with her cousin. Greene, serving the meals, was insistent on formality and table manners when they dined on the china plates.
The story goes that many area politicians, such as the late Sheriff-elect Derwin Brown, would not launch a run for office before first visiting the house and getting a blessing from Greene and Lane.
Moore enjoyed visiting their home simply to "sit with them and just listen to the stories they told." Moore credits "Mother Greene" with teaching her about outreach and community organizing.
"Mamie was right by her side. Wherever Mother went, Mamie's right there," Moore said. When Greene died, her daughter took over a lot of her work.
'Spirit of reconciliation' Ahead of the Nov. 7 vote, city
officials seem generally supportive of the street name change. Several City Council members knew both women personally.
"They were very great folks," Mayor Patricia Wheeler said, remembering when Greene would often call her out of the blue and ask her to meet to discuss a city issue. "She was a wonderful, pleasant person and is still missed a great deal. She and her daughter both."
At a recent public hearing on the measure, eight people spoke about how "Eva Mamie Lane" would appropriately honor the two beloved figures, while moving on from the negative implications attached to the Venable name.
Lance Hammonds, a vice president for the DeKalb branch of the NAACP, told the council that the proposal follows a "spirit of reconciliation" happening across the county. That includes the plaque recently installed next to the Confederate monument in Decatur Square, intended to provide a more accurate account of history and the purpose of the monument.
"The Venable Street name is rooted in hate," Hammonds said. "The city of Stone Mountain has an opportunity to choose how it wants to represent itself to the world. You can choose a symbol of hate and terror, or you can choose symbols of love and reconciliation."
Four rows back at the meeting, Shumake looked on proudly as the goodwill of her aunt and cousin were repeatedly lauded. The legacy would live on.

Texto completo: 2019 is the year of the woman. Or so it certainly seems from the line-up for the 28th edition of the Book Festival of the Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta (MJCCA), taking place across two weeks this year from Oct. 30 to Nov. 18. As always, readings, panels, and author talks represent a broad range of genres and diverse subjects, but for whatever reason, women and women's issues seem to have taken an especially prominent role in this year's festival.
"It honestly wasn't that much by design," says Festival Director Pam Morton. "But we definitely feel like that's been a trending topic."
Each year, organizers take a broad look at authors and titles they think could be a match for Atlanta audiences at the popular annual event. And as Morton suggests, organizers also try to keep an eye on current events and the issues at the center of widespread community conversations.
At each festival, certain trends emerge, and the 28th festival shaped up with an extraordinary number of women authors and notable speakers. A headlining appearance by former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and a talk by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jodi Kantor, whose reports on Harvey Weinstein kicked off the #MeToo movement, will help set the tone.
Clinton will appear at the festival on Nov. 18 at 6:30 p.m. along with her daughter Chelsea to discuss their new book "The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Storiesof Courageand Resilience"in conversation Dr. ValerieMontgomeryRice, President and Dean of Morehouse School of Medicine. In their first book together, the mother and daughter co-authors celebrate the women who have inspired them throughout their lives and careers. Profiles include 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, civil rights activist Dorothy Height, writer Rachel Carson, LGBTQ trailblazer Edie Windsor, historian Mary Beard and swimmer Diana Nyad.
One of the most prominent stories involving women in recent years was the news of Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and abuse. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jodi Kantor, who along with fellow reporter Megan Twohey broke the story for the New York Times, will discuss the new book "She Said" in conversation with Times Bureau Chief Kim Severson on Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. In the book, Kantor reveals how the two reporters broke the story and also delves into the consequences of reporting on the #MeToo movement, in addition to describing the difficult journeys of the women who spoke up.
Also bound to be popular with festival-goers is the Nov. 17 appearance of Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina and former United States ambassador to the United Nations, at 7:30 p.m. Haley's new memoir "With All Due Respect" offers a first-hand perspective and a behind-the-scenes account of her tenure in the Trump administration.
On Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. Pat Mitchell will speak about her book "Becoming a Dangerous Woman." Mitchell's book tells the true story of her journey from being raised on a cotton farm in rural Georgia to becoming a prominent TV and film producer and the first female CEO of PBS and president of CNN Productions.
On Nov. 8 at noon, popular New York style icon Tziporah Salamon offers a very different event, a first for the MJCCA Book Fest, a one-woman stage show in which she tells the story of her Hungarian parents who survived the Holocaust by fleeing to Israel, then New York.
One of today's most acclaimed novelists, Alice Hoffman, speaks about her latest novel "The World That We Knew," a tale of a mother and daughter that unfolds against the backdrop of Europe during the Nazi regime and World War II, on Nov. 10 at 3:30 p.m. in conversation with writer and former AJC contributor Greg Changnon.
Other notable women authors this year include Bari Weiss, speaking about her new book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism" on Nov. 16 at 8 p.m., and author Heather Morris speaking about the follow-up to her bestselling novel "The Tattooist of Auschwitz" titled "Cilka's Journey" on Nov. 4 at noon. Abby Chava Stein will discuss her journey from being born male in a dynastic rabbinical family in a Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn to transitioning to female covered in her book "Becoming Eve" on Nov. 14 at 7:30 p.m., and historian Julie Salamon presents her new book about the 1985 terrorist killing of Leon Klinghoffer titled "An Innocent Bystander" on Nov. 4 at 7:30 p.m.
Although women seem to have taken center stage this year, there are still plenty of headlining events by male authors. On Nov. 9 at 8 p.m., former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara discusses his new book on the legal system "Doing Justice: A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law" in conversation with Atlanta journalist Bill Nigut. Akbar Gbajabiamila discusses his book about his path to becoming an American Ninja Warrior champion, "Everyone Can Be a Ninja," on Nov. 3 at 3:30 p.m. with Atlanta media personality Mara Davis. And the festival opens on Oct. 30 at 7:30 p.m. with television star Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver discussing their new book for middle school kids about a space alien who visits Hollywood.
In all, this year's Book Festival includes more than 45 authors, and organizers estimate that more than 13,000 people from across the Southeast will come to an event at the book festival.

Texto completo: Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line: "I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 but got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

How San Francisco Is Killing Its Restaurants

Texto completo: San Francisco was once known for trendy restaurants with lines out the door. Today, the city's restaurateurs are concerned with keeping their doors open at all. Restaurant closings outpace openings by 9%, according to Yelp data analyzed by the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. In a recent meeting with the Board of Supervisors, one industry veteran said: "We need to do something now, or we will be gone."
How did the outlook for a top restaurant city get so bleak? As Hemingway wrote of bankruptcy, it happened "gradually and then suddenly."
Start with labor costs, which the San Francisco Chronicle identified as "the biggest factor." In 2003 residents passed an initiative that set the minimum wage almost $2 above the state level and then linked it to rise with inflation. A decade later, another initiative incrementally lifted the wage floor to $15 an hour by 2018. On top of this, the city has separate ordinances regulating paid sick leave, employee health-care spending and workplace scheduling.
These costs are magnified by a quirk in California law that prohibits tip income from counting toward a restaurant employee's hourly-wage requirement. An employee who earns several hundred dollars in tips on Friday night is considered no different from a dishwasher who earns none -- even though tips are taxed as income by state and federal authorities. Restaurant owners must pay ever-higher hourly wages to top-earning employees whose take-home pay far exceeds minimum wage.
In their recent meeting with the supervisors, San Francisco's small-restaurant owners enumerated a long list of other problems. Rising rents, exacerbated by the city's hostility to new development, burden employers and employees alike. Requirements for permits can keep restaurants closed for months. The owner of one Hayes Valley spot described her frustration: "I have a small restaurant, and it took two years to open -- a good eight months for permitting." She adds that "I don't even really want to expand anymore, even though it will double my business."
Restaurants have few options to offset these costs. The Chronicle reported in 2016 that prices at the city's signature restaurants "have risen, on average, 26 percent since 2010 and 52 percent since 2005." Tourists and tech employees have shouldered some of the burden through higher prices. But even the city's well-to-do residents and visitors have been stretched far enough to reduce their consumption.
The New York Times reported last year that some of the city's restaurants have adopted a "fine casual" business model. Customers find their own tables, fill their own water glasses and get their own drink refills -- which allows the restaurant to keep labor costs and prices down by staffing fewer tipped employees. Research backs this up: A forthcoming study from economists at Miami University and Trinity University finds that full-service restaurants hire nearly 18% fewer tipped servers, as a share of employment, in expensive markets.
When all options have been exhausted, many restaurants are forced to close, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco. (My organization has chronicled many of these closings at FacesOf15.com.) According to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, San Francisco lost nearly 1,000 full-service restaurant jobs last year. Annual employment growth in the industry has declined every year since 2012, and turned negative the past two years.
Testifying before the supervisors last month, one San Francisco chef warned that the city is becoming a "nonviable" market for restaurant growth. Don't tell that to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, most of whom support raising the national minimum wage to the same level that helped wreck San Francisco's restaurant market. The city's left-of-center legislators have yet to address the hostile policy environment, but Congress should treat San Francisco as a cautionary tale rather than a model to emulate.

Texto completo: El jefe interino del gabinete del presidente Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, reconoció este jueves en una conferencia de prensa que Estados Unidos detuvo la ayuda a Ucrania después de solicitar a este país que investigara a un servidor del Comité Nacional Demócrata . Mulvaney quitó hierro al asunto y negó que esta solicitud tuviera relación alguna con Joe Biden o su hijo Hunter.
“ Lo hacemos todo el tiempo con nuestra política exterior “, dijo el jefe de gabinete para justificar que el gobierno haya s olicitado a Ucrania algo a cambio (quid pro quo) de la ayuda estadounidense a otros países . Mulvaney se refirió específicamente al pedido de Trump para que su homólogo ucraniano investigara a un servidor del Comité Demócrata Nacional (CDN) .

“¿Me habló (Trump) en el pasado sobre la corrupción relacionada al servidor de CND? Absolutamente. No hay duda de eso. Y por eso fue que frenamos el dinero”, dijo Mulvaney a los periodistas de la Casa Blanca. El jefe del gabinete de la Casa Blanca dijo también que una de las principales preocupaciones de Trump era “ investigar qué fue lo que ocurrió en 2016 “, en referencia a la corrupción en Ucrania.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, effectively confirmed the main premise of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry on Thursday, telling reporters that aid was held back from Ukraine in part to prod the country to investigate Democrats https://t.co/Uep9uueYlf
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 17, 2019
Mulvaney reconocía con sus palabras que Trump había detenido la ayuda a Ucrania, en parte, para presionar al país a investigar al servidor demócrata . Sin embargo, poco después Mulvaney se retractó de sus palabras y dijo que el corte de la financiación no condicionaba a Ucrania a indagar una supuesta interferencia en las elecciones de 2016 y acusó a la prensa de “malinterpretar” sus palabras para “avanzar en una caza de bruja […] contra el presidente Trump”.
“Déjenme ser claro, no hubo absolutamente ningún quid pro quo entre la ayuda militar ucraniana y cualquier investigación sobre las elecciones de 2016″, aclaró a posteriori. “El presidente nunca me pidió retener nada de dinero hasta que los ucranianos hicieran algo relacionado con el servidor”. Mulvaney insistió en explicar que la única razón por la que detuvieron los fondos de seguridad fue para revisar que otras naciones estaban implicadas en acabar con la corrupción.

Texto completo: Un hombre sin hogar atravesaba un vecindario industrial en el centro de Oklahoma City el 12 de agosto cuando la policía lo vio. Pasaba de las 10 p.m. y los oficiales observaron que el desaliñado hombre sin camisa y una mochila al hombro no tenía luces traseras en su bicicleta.
Cuando intentaron detenerlo, Cody Gregg aceleró más para luego tirar la bicicleta unas cuadras adelante e intentar huir a pie. Los policías lo alcanzaron e inspeccionaron su mochila. Dentro encontraron un sospechoso polvo blanco en una lata de café, según documentos judiciales consultados por el diario The Oklahoman.
“Dentro del bolso había una gran cantidad de substancia blanca en polvo que basado en mi experiencia y mi entrenamiento creí que se trataba de cocaína”, dijo el oficial que hizo la revisión, según el diario citado. “Más tarde, el polvo blanco dentro del bolso dio resultado positivo para cocaína y era un paquete que pesaba en total 45.91 gramos de cocaína”, añadió.
Gregg fue acusado de posesión de cocaína con intención de distribución y fue enviado a la cárcel del condado de Oklahoma mientras aguardaba su juicio. Él se declaró inocente. Pero la semana pasada, tras dos meses, su arresto fue en agosto, se cansó de esperar y se declaró culpable. Fue sentenciado a 15 años en prisión.
La cárcel del condado de Oklahoma ha estado plagada de problemas durante años, como goteras, moho, sobrepoblación y una tasa de suicidios y muertes mayor a la del promedio nacional, según The Oklahoman.
El jueves pasado, sólo dos días después de recibir su prolongada sentencia, resultados de laboratorio demostraron que el polvo blanco no era cocaína, sino leche en polvo. Gregg le dijo al juez que había conseguido la leche de un dispensario de alimentos, según el diario citado.
Al día siguiente, Gregg solicitó a la corte que le permitieran retirar su declaración de culpabilidad, a la luz de la nueva evidencia. El juez de distrito Timothy R. Henderson concedió su petición y además desechó los cargos en su contra.
Gregg estaba bajo libertad condicional al momento de su arresto. Según documentos de la corte consultados por el diario The Washington Post, había sido arrestado por cargos relacionados con narcóticos al menos unas tres veces desde 2014.
El viernes salió en libertad.
El Washington Post reporta que no es la primera vez que un resultado de laboratorio equivocado termina en la convicción de una persona inocente. Las pruebas químicas que utilizan las policías alrededor de todo el país para determinar si una substancia es ilícita fallan frecuentemente.
En 2016, una investigación del diario The New York Times y la organización de periodistas sin fines de lucro ProPublica, revelaron que hay miles de personas en la cárcel por pruebas que tienen un amplio margen de error.
Una lista de los artículos que han dado un falso positivo a cocaína, recogida por el Washington Post, incluyó cosas como galletas de chocolate, el glaseado de una dona Krispy Cream y tabletas de menta. Algunos estudios citados por este diario indican que un quinto o hasta un tercio de las pruebas están erradas. Sin embargo, las policías las siguen utilizando como una herramienta cotidiana.
La historia de Gregg ilustra otro problema: muchas personas prefieren declararse culpables para no tener que esperar meses o incluso años para tener un juicio. Más de la mitad de las personas acusadas de delitos de drogas con base en una prueba de laboratorio errada se declararon culpables a la primera oportunidad, según el estudio del New York Times y ProPublica.

Texto completo: Three thousand Iowans showed up in downtown Iowa City on Friday, Oct. 4, and cheered wildly as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, of Sweden, took to the stage. As a member of 100Grannies for a Livable Future, who have been supporting the local School Climate Strikers for months, I was thrilled to share the stage with Greta and the youth that have ignited the school board and city hall. Both have agreed to increase their commitments in order to meet the IPCC goals.
Thank you to Mayor Throgmorton, Senator Joe Bolkom, and other local leaders who showed up to speak. Friday's rally was a huge celebration for the children who are taking the lead because, as Greta pointed out, "Somebody has to be the adults in the room."
A powerful "Town-Gown" challenge was issued to President Harreld of the University of Iowa to "stop making excuses" and close the coal plant in the center of town that is still spewing carbon emissions without converting to long-term use of natural gas. It is time– because we are about out of time– to do the impossible.
These kids know only too well what they are facing: A recent UN report states that over one million living species face extinction in the near future.
The human species cannot be far behind. (www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/)
It's clear we cannot count on our government to work with the nations of the world in order to protect and preserve this planet. Congress is in deadlock and the executive branch is doing everything in its power (and reaching far beyond the constitutional limits of that power) to thwart any progress toward solving this global existential crisis. It is, in fact, denying the science and pushing policies that exacerbate it.
Case in point, the New York Times recently reported that 85 environmental
Rules are on the way out under Mr. Trump. (www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html)
Our government, which is charged with the protection and wellbeing of its citizens, is instead protecting and benefiting the fossil fuel corporations.
Our Nero is fiddling and feeding the flames, while we literally watch our planet burn.
Our hope lies with the youth and with preserving our democratic right to participate in non-violent civil disobedience that made it possible to achieve women's suffrage, advance civil rights, end the war in Vietnam, and create important regulations for environmental protections.
Following this time-honored path on June 11, the "Climate Defenders Five" were arrested while carrying a banner about the urgency of the climate crisis outside a fundraiser for President Trump in West Des Moines. I vehemently maintain that we were totally justified, under Iowa law, to bring our message to this gathering. We face trial on Oct. 10.
This failure of two branches of our government to protect the common good and preserve our public trust is why I now look to the courts, on every level, to immediately address this crisis with the necessary courage and precedent-setting decisions.
Our Iowa Constitution states: "All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people, and they have the right, at all times, to alter or reform the same, whenever the public good may require it."
We require it now!

Texto completo: San Francisco was once known for trendy restaurants with lines out the door. Today, the city's restaurateurs are concerned with keeping their doors open at all. Restaurant closings outpace openings by 9%, according to Yelp data analyzed by the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. In a recent meeting with the Board of Supervisors, one industry veteran said: "We need to do something now, or we will be gone."
How did the outlook for a top restaurant city get so bleak? As Hemingway wrote of bankruptcy, it happened "gradually and then suddenly."
Start with labor costs, which the San Francisco Chronicle identified as "the biggest factor." In 2003 residents passed an initiative that set the minimum wage almost $2 above the state level and then linked it to rise with inflation. A decade later, another initiative incrementally lifted the wage floor to $15 an hour by 2018. On top of this, the city has separate ordinances regulating paid sick leave, employee health-care spending and workplace scheduling.
These costs are magnified by a quirk in California law that prohibits tip income from counting toward a restaurant employee's hourly-wage requirement. An employee who earns several hundred dollars in tips on Friday night is considered no different from a dishwasher who earns none—even though tips are taxed as income by state and federal authorities. Restaurant owners must pay ever-higher hourly wages to top-earning employees whose take-home pay far exceeds minimum wage.
In their recent meeting with the supervisors, San Francisco's small-restaurant owners enumerated a long list of other problems. Rising rents, exacerbated by the city's hostility to new development, burden employers and employees alike. Requirements for permits can keep restaurants closed for months. The owner of one Hayes Valley spot described her frustration: "I have a small restaurant, and it took two years to open—a good eight months for permitting." She adds that "I don't even really want to expand anymore, even though it will double my business."
Restaurants have few options to offset these costs. The Chronicle reported in 2016 that prices at the city's signature restaurants "have risen, on average, 26 percent since 2010 and 52 percent since 2005." Tourists and tech employees have shouldered some of the burden through higher prices. But even the city's well-to-do residents and visitors have been stretched far enough to reduce their consumption.
The New York Times reported last year that some of the city's restaurants have adopted a "fine casual" business model. Customers find their own tables, fill their own water glasses and get their own drink refills—which allows the restaurant to keep labor costs and prices down by staffing fewer tipped employees. Research backs this up: A forthcoming study from economists at Miami University and Trinity University finds that full-service restaurants hire nearly 18% fewer tipped servers, as a share of employment, in expensive markets.
When all options have been exhausted, many restaurants are forced to close, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco. (My organization has chronicled many of these closings at FacesOf15.com.) According to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, San Francisco lost nearly 1,000 full-service restaurant jobs last year. Annual employment growth in the industry has declined every year since 2012, and turned negative the past two years.
Testifying before the supervisors last month, one San Francisco chef warned that the city is becoming a "nonviable" market for restaurant growth. Don't tell that to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, most of whom support raising the national minimum wage to the same level that helped wreck San Francisco's restaurant market. The city's left-of-center legislators have yet to address the hostile policy environment, but Congress should treat San Francisco as a cautionary tale rather than a model to emulate.
Mr. Saltsman is managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which receives some support from restaurants.

NEW YORK—Marc Benioff, co-founder and co-CEO of business-software company Salesforce.com Inc., told business journalists Wednesday that it was time to apply much stronger controls to social media, artificial intelligence and other technologies.
Mr. Benioff renewed his assertion that Facebook "is the new cigarettes." He called for the abolishment of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 legislation that immunizes an "interactive computer service" from liability for information that third parties publish on its platform. The billionaire proclaimed that "capitalism is dead," while holding out hope for a new form of capitalism that puts stakeholders on par with shareholders.
He said he was "shocked by resistance" to San Francisco's Proposition C, which called for higher taxes on businesses to raise funds for addressing homelessness. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, is a prominent opponent , arguing the measure is unfair to Square and fintech startups. San Francisco voters approved Proposition C in November 2018, though the city has said it won't spend the money raised until legal questions are settled.
On WeWork, whose plans for an initial public offering were derailed recently , Mr. Benioff said that "an IPO is like a spiritual cleanse." That's because going public earlier in its life forces a startup to do things like find a top CEO, he said. Mr. Benioff said WeWork founder Adam Neumann, who resigned as chief executive, is a visionary, "but for sure some issues in the company got cleansed." SoftBank Group Corp., which owns a third of WeWork, has prepared a financing package that would give it control.
Mr. Benioff was speaking during an event honoring the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship in Economics and Business Journalism, a program at Columbia University. He was interviewed on stage by New York Times Deputy Managing Editor Rebecca Blumenstein, previously a top editor at The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Benioff entered the news business himself last year when he and his wife purchased Time magazine. Highlights:
Ms. Blumenstein: How worried are you about the upcoming election and misinformation?
Mr. Benioff: Well, I think we all should we be worried based on what we have seen. You know, unless we are living in a capsule and not reading anything, which some days, I would prefer to do, actually. But we should be worried. We should be worried because there are still a lot of things we don't understand about how the technology is shaping us, and how the technology is much smarter than it was even just a couple of years ago. Let me give you an example, something that is amazing to me….We have a drone that is flying over the ocean right now….It is run by the University of California, Santa Barbara. The drone is using advanced artificial intelligence…some that we developed. And it spots a great white shark…and then the classification engine also says oh, look, it is a kids' surfing camp right here. And they were able to call the beach and have the kids get out of the water.
Now that's the use of AI for good. But technology is never good or bad. It's what we do with the technology that matters….We are in this fourth industrial revolution. We all know that. And not just the information technologies, but the biotechnologies as well. It is incredible what is going on. But we have to guide the technology. We have to point it in the right direction. Otherwise we are going to end up somewhere that we don't want to do.
Ms. Blumenstein: Don't you enable this to a certain extent?
Mr. Benioff: Well, I hope not….Companies can't wash their hands of what people do with their products. That is a key point of ethical use. And that is where I think I have had to double down inside Salesforce over the last year and a half, two years. As our technology is getting more advanced, how is it being used ethically? We set up inside our company an office of ethical and humane use. We hired a top ethicist. We built a network of the top NGOs and nonprofits in the world…to help guide us. And we have made a number of decisions around ethical use, including by the way, we no longer sell military weapons or assault weapons through our commerce platform. Our team came to us and said this is no longer something we can do. And we turned that off. That is a tough decision, by the way. But those are the hard decisions CEOs are going to have to make. And that is something that we are willing to do….This is evangelical work."

Debate ratings dip on busy day; Against a big baseball game, the Democratic meetup is the least watched in 2019.

Texto completo: The fourth Democratic presidential primary debate drew an average audience of 8.3 million viewers for CNN on Tuesday, the smallest TV audience for the 2020 White House contenders.
The figure from Nielsen is a well below the 8.7 million who watched the first round of CNN's July 30 debate. The decline is likely because of stronger competition in prime time, including a National League Championship Series game on TBS, at which the Washington Nationals earned their first trip to the World Series in franchise history.
The debate also had an average streaming audience of 449,000 viewers on the websites of CNN and the New York Times, which teamed with the cable news channel on the event.

The TV audience level was down 22% from the 10.7 million who watched the second round of the second Democratic primary debate on CNN. The largest audience for a Democratic debate in the 2020 campaign cycle is 18.1 million viewers who watched the second round of the first Democratic debate simulcast across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo on June 27.
The last debate on Sept. 12, which aired on ABC and Univision, had an audience of 14 million viewers.
Nevertheless, CNN's audience for the Democratic candidates competing to face President Trump in the 2020 election remains higher than most debates in pre-2016 campaign seasons at such an early stage. In the years before Trump turbocharged the ratings during the 2016 race, the largest audience for a primary debate before the Iowa caucuses were held was the 9.3 million who watched Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama face off in January 2008.
The three-hour event held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was the first since Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has emerged as a front-runner. She spent much of the night parrying questions on how her administration would fund her proposals of Medicare for all and free tuition at public colleges.
The 12 candidates on CNN's stage was a record number for a primary debate. ABC's debate had 10 candidates, and the previous events held on NBC and CNN split up the qualifying contenders over two nights.
The lineup included former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Why Pete Buttigieg's moment could last well past the debate

Texto completo: By most accounts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had a great debate Tuesday night. So did Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
But unlike Klobuchar and virtually all other Democratic presidential candidates, Buttigieg has built out a campaign infrastructure that could, in theory, help him sustain momentum from his highly praised performance.
Buttigieg has a large campaign presence in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire so he could quickly translate his star turn into something more tangible and lasting.
In raw terms, this means that Buttigieg has the money, the staff, the data, and the endorsements to rapidly expand his reach.
He had $23.4 million in the bank at the end of last month, more than twice what Biden did. He has hundreds of people on staff.
The 37-year-old's campaign offices have lists of potential supporters to reach out to Wednesday and beyond, and can ask them to show up and make calls to other voters.
Klobuchar, by way of comparision, doesn't have any of this. It means whatever momentum she has could be fleeting.
Bolstered by his success in fundraising in the first half of the year, Buttigieg spent the summer building out a campaign infrastructure.
In New Hampshire, for example, Buttigieg has 13 offices, more than any other campaign. (Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second with 10 offices.) In those Buttigieg offices, there are 64 staff members, with 57 of them slotted for direct voter contact, according to the campaign. A few campaigns have more staff on the ground in the state, but they tend to be in roles that are not in direct contact with voters.
Buttigieg also has the highest number of offices in Iowa, 22, again slightly edging out Warren, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Buttigieg's campaign says they have more than 100 staffers on the ground there. It has also been running television ads in the Hawkeye State for a month.
There is a reason why all of this matters.
History has shown that while it is easy for candidates to have “a moment," it is very hard for them to sustain the moment. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum may have won the Iowa Caucuses, but they didn't have anything to help them in the following states to keep it going. This is where the spade work in the early primary states can help the most.
Just consider Senator Kamala Harris of California. She was riding high after her June debate performance. Polls quickly found her to be a top-tier candidate.
But Harris spent considerably less time in Iowa and New Hampshire than other major candidates and made building out her infrastructure, staff, and endorsements less of a priority. Within a month, she was fading.
As it stands, there are 19 Democratic presidential candidates running for president. On the ground in the early states, just a few candidates have built an infrastructure able to capitalize on any momentum. And among that group, no candidate is better built as a “growth stock" than Buttigieg, who has sat just outside of the top tier of candidates, including Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Tuesday's debate marks the second burst of mometum for Buttigieg. In March, he came out of obscurity during a CNN town hall in Texas where he attacked Vice President Mike Pence's views on homosexuality. Following that performance, Buttigieg was a hot ticket on the campaign trail, but his staff didn't yet have the capacity to grab personal data from the huge crowds swarming his events.
This time around, however, it is different. Buttigieg needs to find a way to get into the top tier and improve his standing among female voters and people of color. It's unclear if Team Buttigieg can pull that off. But they are uniquely set up to give it a shot.

Texto completo: Yesterday this column noted that judicial radicalism is increasingly embraced by establishment Democrats. At last night's Democratic debate, presidential candidates kicked around the idea of restructuring the Supreme Court by adding new Justices or perhaps forcing out current ones via term limits.
The general idea is to change the judiciary until it produces their desired political results. To his credit, former Vice President Joe Biden warned his fellow Democrats against attempting to pack the court with ideological allies, as it would surely reduce the public's respect for legal decisions.
But unfortunately the idea probably isn't going away. David Leonhardt, a relative moderate among the leftists at the New York Times opinion pages,
recently expressed a view held by many elected Democrats when he wrote that "the country has reached the point where once-unthinkable solutions are worth debating." Added the Timesman:
I don't like the idea of court packing, which I think could lead to never-ending escalation between the parties and the potential breakdown of the judicial system. But I also find the status quo unacceptable: A court majority of dubious democratic legitimacy that sometimes acts as a kind of partisan super legislature...
And remember: Every 5-4 decision that breaks along partisan lines likely would have gone the other way if Senate Republicans hadn't stolen a seat from Obama.
By "stolen," Mr. Leonhardt means that in the appropriate exercise of its constitutional role in 2016, the Senate did not consent to President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.
And of course Mr. Leonhardt's smear goes much further, as he called the entire majority of the Supreme Court "of dubious democratic legitimacy." Here's his argument:
Four of the nine current Supreme Court justices have been named by presidents who took office despite losing the popular vote.
Two of those four justices were named by a president whose victory was clinched when the Supreme Court ordered a halt to vote counting.
He's talking about Justices who were appointed by duly-elected Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump—and then confirmed by the Senate. To make his argument, the Times columnist appears to be clinging to Constitutionally irrelevant nationwide popular vote totals to denigrate winning campaigns by Messrs. Bush and Trump.
It's corrosive enough for our politics when partisans refuse to accept the legitimate results of elections. But the Leonhardt critique is also highly misleading.
It's true that George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and therefore the Presidency in 2000. It's true that in 2000 he received fewer votes nationwide than his opponent. It's also true that in 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that a Democratic effort to apply different vote-counting standards in different parts of Florida was not constitutional, which allowed the Florida secretary of state's certification of a Bush victory to stand.
But the two Bush appointees whom Mr. Leonhardt seeks to smear were appointed in 2005, a year after Mr. Bush had won re-election. In that 2004 contest, Mr. Bush not only won a decisive victory on the only scoreboard that counts—at the Electoral College—Mr. Bush also won on the scoreboard that Mr. Leonhardt claims ought to count. Nationwide, Mr. Bush surpassed his opponent by more than 3 million votes.
During the 2000s, this column's most celebrated alumnus created the gag headline, "We Blame George W. Bush." It was intended to poke fun at the media habit of blaming America's 43rd President even for problems he could not possibly have caused.
Now the left won't even give George W. Bush credit for the votes he clearly earned.

Resumen: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT exams. The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by The New York Times and Washington Post, among others. The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT exams.
The action comes about a week before high school students throughout the state are due to take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, or PSAT, which among other things is used to determine eligibility for National Merit Scholarships.
Next spring, high school juniors throughout the state will take the SAT, a college-entrance exam that the state mandates as part of its school accountability program.
The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by The New York Times and Washington Post, among others.
In May, a representative from the College Board, Todd Iverson, confirmed to the state Senate Judiciary Committee that the company sells access to data from Illinois students for 45 cents per student. That testimony came as the panel was considering legislation to strengthen the state’s Student Online Personal Protection Act.
But Sara Sympson, a spokeswoman for the College Board, said in an email Thursday the nonprofit company does not "sell" the data but, rather, makes the information available "under strict licensing agreements with colleges, scholarship partners, and nonprofit organizations."
The program is voluntary, she said, and students must "affirmatively declare" they want to have conversations with schools and scholarship providers.
Those who access the data, she said, must adhere to precise rules that require the data be used for only noncommercial, education-related purposes. They also must agree not to share student information with third parties, other than mail service providers and other contractors, and they must destroy the data once their agreement expires.
"Students and their families need information to help them navigate the winding and complicated path to college and career," Sympson said. "Student Search fills that need, providing information that can support their transition to college, particularly for historically underrepresented student populations who are already disproportionately unlikely to apply, enroll, and graduate from college."
But the group of lawmakers urging Raoul to investigate argued that the College Board is less than transparent about the program.
"Although the College Board asks students for their consent (including those under age 18) for disclosing their data to colleges, universities and scholarship providers, they do not inform either students or parents that they will be providing the data to these organizations in exchange for a monetary payment," the lawmakers said in a letter to Raoul.
The data involved in the program includes not just students’ test scores, but also information they provide on survey questionnaires that accompany those exams, such as their academic interests and their activities in high school. Colleges, universities and scholarship programs buy the data to identify prospective students.
The lawmakers also noted the College Board is a significant vendor for the state. It has a $29 million contract with the Illinois State Board of Education for the SAT and PSAT exams, and last year it was paid more than $2 million to cover fees for Advanced Placement Tests for low-income students.
The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.
The letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Cristina Castro, of Elgin; Robert Martwick, of Chicago; Laura Murphy, of Des Plaines; and Robert Peters, of Chicago. Democratic Reps. Robyn Gabel, of Evanston and Will Guzzardi, Lindsey LaPointe, Aaron Ortiz and Ann Williams, all of Chicago, also signed on.
A spokeswoman for Raoul said in an email the office is aware of the lawmakers’ concerns and is looking into the matter.
Cassie Creswell, who heads the advocacy group Illinois Families for Public Schools, said in an interview that Raoul’s office has worked with students and parents to fill out consumer complaint forms so the office can begin an investigation.

Hunter Biden talks Ukraine company

Texto completo: In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden said his involvement with a Ukraine company while his father was vice president was "poor judgment" but firmly maintained that he did nothing wrong.
"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake," Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview that aired Tuesday. "So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever."
Hunter Biden told ABC News that he never spoke to his father about his business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president. He also admitted in the interview that he was not sure he would have been on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company, if he wasn't Joe Biden's son.
But he maintains that he was qualified for the job because he had previously served on various boards.
"I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden," the 49-year-old said. "Because my dad was vice president of the United States. There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full-grown adult that my father in some way hasn't had influence over."
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
The New York Times reported in May that Joe Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. The country's current prosecutor maintains that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter.
In July, President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to investigate Joe Biden. It led to the House of Representatives starting an impeachment inquiry.
When a transcript of the Trump's call was released, Hunter told ABC News that he was "shocked." He said that he immediately called his father — who first asked about Hunter's daughter Maisey.
"For real. And that's not a joke," Hunter said to ABC News. "I mean, and then discussion was literally like, 'Oh my gosh. But other than that, really, I want to make it clear, it's not like anybody has to have any discussion beyond that."
Hunter Biden also spoke about his sobriety and his issues with substance abuse. He said that his father doesn't have to defend him and that he "loves me unequivocally."
The presidential candidate's son said he doesn't worry about being a target of Trump.
"Being the subject of Donald Trump's ire is a feather in my cap," he said. "It's not something that I go to bed nervous about at night at all. The reason I'm able to do that is because I am absolutely enveloped in love of my family."

Vehicle pollution keeps growing

Texto completo: Pollution from auto emissions has gone up 55 percent in the Tampa Bay area since 1990, according to a nationwide analysis the New York Times published last week.

The numbers are nearly the same or worse for other parts of the state during that time period: a 53 percent increase in the Jacksonville area; 58 percent in the Dade-Broward region; 61 percent in the Sarasota-Bradenton area; 98 percent in the Orlando region; and a whopping 126 percent in Naples.

In some areas the increase is partly due to population growth, but in others the per capita amount of pollution has increased as well. In the Tampa Bay area, the amount of vehicle-related pollution produced per person has gone up by 4 percent since 1990.

The newspaper noted that these figures  based on data collected by Boston University  are important because transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today and the bulk of those emissions come from driving in our cities and suburbs. About 60 percent of the vehicle emissions come from the nations 250 million passenger vehicles, with 23 percent from commercial truck traffic.

Pinellas and Hillsborough counties used to be among the six Florida counties that required drivers to bring their vehicles in for an annual emissions inspection every year. In addition to a cursory safety check, inspectors were looking for cars that were belching smoke like a Rust Belt factory. The other counties were Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Duval.

Florida was required to launch the emissions inspection program in 1991, after those six regions flunked federal smog standards. Every year inspec

tors spotted thousands of vehicles that couldnt pass muster. In 1999, for instance, the inspectors ordered 25,941 drivers to repair their vehicles or scrap their beaters.

But motorists disliked sitting in long lines and breathing the noxious fumes while waiting their turn to fork over money for the inspection. In 2000, the Legislature and then-Gov. Jeb Bush teamed up to eliminate the inspections entirely. They declared it to be both expensive  costing a total of $52 million a year  and unneeded, given that the Environmental Protection Agency under Florida native Carol Browner said the states air had gotten cleaner.

The vehicle inspection program is not an efficient tool for reducing pollution and is an unnecessary burden to motorists, Bush said then. Preliminary approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed that emission testing is not necessary to maintain air quality standards in all the Florida counties they have reviewed.

Efforts by the American Lung Association and civic and environmental groups failed to sway the politicians who were happy to support a deregulation move that saved people both money and aggravation.

But 19 years later, Its hard to argue that our air wouldnt be cleaner here in Florida today if we still had emissions testing, said Mark Ferrulo of Progress Florida, who in 2000 was leading one of the civic groups trying to save the program.

Bush, in an email to the Tampa Bay Times, defended ending the program.

The emissions testing was not so consumer friendly, it cost too much, Bush wrote. We saved millions each year for Florida. I am proud of getting that done and there is no evidence that it had any influence on increased emissions since they were growing before the action taken. But I do know that used car owners were delighted that they didnt have to go through the agony of inspections.

For Tampa Bay, auto emissions are more than just an air pollution problem. According to Maya Burke of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, what comes out of drivers tailpipes ends up settling into the water and polluting that too.

Its one of our primary sources of nitrogen pollution, Burke said. The quasi-governmental organizations most recent report on the bay shows vehicle emissions account for 17 percent of all the nitrogen in the bay.

Originally wastewater flowing into the bay and power plant smoke accounted for a greater percentage of the pollution problem, she said. But over the years local governments have cut back on the wastewater dumping and added scrubbers to power plant smokestacks. Meanwhile, the auto emissions continued apace, and gradually became a larger percentage of the problem, she explained.

We try to tell people that air quality equals water quality, Burke said. All that pollution in the air comes back in the form of nitrogen that lands in the bay.

Nitrogen pollution fuels algae blooms such as Red Tide when it drifts near shore and can also cause sea grass die-offs.

Florida is considered one of the states that is most vulnerable to climate change because its a peninsula surrounded by water and the land is flatter than Kansas, meaning sea level rise will go farther inland faster.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker
* South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
* California Sen. Kamala Harris
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?
Graham Walker is executive director of the Independent Institute, based in Oakland.

Beto O’Rourke on taking AR-15s from gun owners: ‘I believe that they will do the right thing’

Texto completo: Beto O'Rourke said the key enforcement mechanism for his proposed AR-15 confiscation is a belief that the American people will participate.
During the fourth round of Democratic presidential debates, O'Rourke was asked how he would deliver on a promise he made during the last round of debates to confiscate "weapons of war" from American gun owners given that it is unknown how many guns are in the country and who owns them.
CNN host Anderson Cooper noted that O'Rourke has promised to fine gun owners who don't participate in a mandatory buyback but asked how he could ensure that all AR-15s and similar weapons were off the streets, as he has promised police would not be going "door-to-door."
O'Rourke claimed those who brandish their weapons will face legal action, but most, he believes, will be turned over from Americans.
"If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public to brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement," said O'Rourke.
He continued, "But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing."

O'Rourke also used the debate stage to go after his fellow Democrats who have called for a ban on the sales of AR-15s but have stopped short of calling for a full ownership ban.
"So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own," said O'Rourke.

Nixon, Grant, and Buchanan are off the hook: Trump ‘most corrupt’ president in history, according to 2020 Democrats

Texto completo: President Trump is everything to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

He is even the “most corrupt” president in the history of the United States, according to Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.

“In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It is not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause,” said Sanders at the outset of Tuesday’s Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.

Biden later added that Trump "is the most corrupt president in modern history and, I think, all of our history.”

“[Trump] is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had,” said Harris.

This should come as a great relief to former Presidents James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Warren Harding, and even Richard Nixon. Yes, according to the 2020 candidates, Trump is worse than even Nixon, who you might remember resigned rather than be impeached over a little something called Watergate.

Buchanan’s gross mismanagement, incompetence, and general corruption as president was the final straw that launched the U.S. into civil war, claiming the lives of an estimated 620,000 Americans. A special committee ruled in 1860 that Buchanan’s administration was the most corrupt in history.

Johnson regularly flouted laws passed by Congress. He frequently challenged Congress’ legal authority. Johnson also sacked federal officials without seeking consent from Congress. All this led to his eventual impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. Johnson was acquitted that same year, mostly because the charges, which were political, did not come close to meeting the threshold for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” After Johnson left office, the U.S. was plunged into the worst recession in its history.

Grant’s tenure in the White House is notable only because it was so corrupt.
Then there is Harding, who is probably the reigning champion in the nepotism category. He filled his White House with friends and family, many of whom lined their pockets with unethical, or likely illegal, kickbacks. The worst of it was when it was revealed that members of Harding’s administration took bribes from private companies in return for leases to drill on public lands.
Then there is Nixon, who was a walking, talking caricature of corruption. From Watergate to illegal bombing campaigns in Cambodia to sabotaging the Vietnam peace talks to win his presidential election bid to holding an "enemies list," America’s 37th president had it all.

Sanders actually said with a straight face Tuesday evening that Trump is worse than all of this because of possible emoluments clause violations.

Please. Get a hold of yourself, people.

Nixon will likely go on holding the distinction of being the worst commander in chief in history, even after Trump and his cohort are long gone.

Trump’s hands certainly seem dirty. There certainly seems to be a lot of smoke where Democrats and their allies in the press say there is a fire. But let’s wait on handing the Trump White House first-place trophy for “most corrupt.”

That is not for us to decide for now. Only time can do that.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden has already acknowledged he had reservations about his son's seedy international business deals, and yet at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday, he felt fully confident pretending he never did that.
CNN's Anderson Cooper, who helped moderate the debate, gave a helpful assist to Biden by asserting — without evidence! — that Hunter Biden had never done anything afoul while working with a Ukrainian gas company as his dad engaged with the country on policy matters.
Biden said that he did nothing wrong and his son did nothing wrong and that the real problem, of course, was President Trump.
Except his own son has already acknowledged that, at the very least, it was "poor judgment" to take a job that paid him tens of thousands of dollars each month while his dad was making policy decisions with the government of the country that was investigating that very company.
Joe Biden himself has admitted that he knew there was something concerning about what his son was doing. “He did say at one point that it came out that he was on the board [of Ukrainian gas company Burisma],” Biden recalled in a recent radio interview, “I said, ‘I sure hope to hell you know what you’re doing.' Period. I said that.”
Asked by the interviewer Jack Heath what exactly it was that concerned Biden about his son and Burisma, the 2020 candidate said, “What his job was.”
Um ... Does this not bother Cooper? Anyone?
Biden is in quicksand, and his answer at the debate won't help it.

Texto completo: Kamala Harris claimed that President Trump has already confessed to committing a crime and that he should be impeached.
Harris appeared at the fourth Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday night with 11 other candidates. The joint CNN/New York Times debate kicked off with questions to the candidates over possible impeachment and removal from office.
Harris began the debate claiming that the evidence already compiled against Trump is enough to justify impeachment.
"It's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight," Harris said. "He has consistently, since he won, been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security."
"On this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy," Harris said. "Congress must act. The reality of it is that I don’t think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it."iFrame Object

Texto completo: Fiona Hill, antigua asesora del gobierno de Donald Trump en Rusia, declaró este lunes que vio “irregularidades” en las relaciones diplomáticas de Estados Unidos con Ucrania . En el marco del proceso de investigación previo a un posible impeachment del presidente, Hill desveló la información a los legisladores demócratas y aseguró que ella se opuso enérgicamente y en varias ocasiones a la expulsión a principios de este 2019 a la embajadora en Ucrania Marie Yovanovitch .
Tal y como adelantó el diario The New York Times, un fuente anónima familiarizada con la investigación de los demócratas dijo que, durante las 10 horas que duró su testimonio, la exasesora afirmó haber notificado en su momento las “irregularidades” que vio . Por su parte, la embajadora Yovanovitch había declarado previamente que Trump presionó al Departamento de Estado para que la despidiera.
El testimonio de Hill forma parte de los intentos de la Cámara de Representantes por descubrir si Trump presionó a funcionarios ucranianos para que investigaran al hijo de su rival político Joe Biden y la supuesta injerencia de este país en las elecciones presidenciales 2016. Para esta semana hay otras cinco entrevistas previstas, la mayoría de ellas con funcionarios del Departamento de Estado. Sin embargo, no está claro quienes se presentarán después de que Trump se negara a cooperar la investigación.
Según la agencia Associated Press, la investigación podría extenderse hasta la semana que viene para tratar de determinar si la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania era una manera de presionar a este país para que iniciara las investigaciones contra Hunter Biden.

Texto completo: Twelve Democratic presidential candidates sparred Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event:
11 p. m. EDT
Warren emerges as top target in feisty debate
Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren.
Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs.
“Your idea is not the only idea,” Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires.
The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden’s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren’s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: “I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond. ”
The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes.
“So let me be clear on this,” Warren said. “Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. ”
Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response.
“Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,” he said in response to Warren. “Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. ”
Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it.
“At least Bernie’s being honest here,” Klobuchar said at one point. “I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice. ”
It was a frontrunner’s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage.
President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden’s son – Hunter Biden – and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with.
Biden said his son “did nothing wrong” and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday “speaks for itself. ”
Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact.
“That was so offensive," Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son’s foreign business.
Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U. S. troops from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U. S. -allied Kurds.
The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump’s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region.
“I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being – having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,” Biden said.
The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage.
“So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U. S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,” Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg.
“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy,” Buttigieg responded. “What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. ”
Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate – to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from “staying alive” to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing.
Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren’t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O’Rourke.

10:47 p. m. EDT
Biden to Warren: ‘You did a hell of a job’
In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington.
The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden’s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach.
To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach.
“I went on the floor and got you votes,” a visibly upset Biden told Warren. “I got you votes. ”
Warren looked past Biden’s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama.
“I am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,” Warren said.
“You did a hell of job in your job,” Biden acknowledged.
“Thank you,” Warren said.

10:40 p. m. EDT
Democrats name check . . . Robert Bork?
The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork.
Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that "Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep. "
Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact.
"Bork has been dead for six years. He’s more than asleep," tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago. )
Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler: “You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. ”
Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon.
Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations.

10:29 p. m. EDT
Cory Booker, a vegan, calls Trump 'most unhealthy' candidate
In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates – Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren – about their health.
“I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,” the New Jersey senator said. “It’s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump. ”
In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is “in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond. ”
A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate’ physical health.
– Ledyard King
10:15 p. m. EDT
Sanders: 'I'm feeling great'
When pressed about whether he’s “up to the stress” of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, “I’m healthy. I’m feeling great. ” The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital “made me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system. ”
But as the Vermont senator seeks to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All, the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020.
A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate’ physical health.
Sanders said he’s reassuring Americans about his fitness by “mounting a vigorous campaign” across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery.
The same question was put to another septuagenarian – Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office.
“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience – with it comes wisdom,” Biden said.
9:55 p. m. EDT
Buttigieg takes on O'Rourke over gun buybacks
Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they’ve been having over O’Rourke’s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons.
Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O’Rourke said he expects “my fellow Americans to follow the law. ”
Buttigieg, who has called O’Rourke’s proposal a “shiny object” that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O’Rourke’s response makes clear that he doesn’t know how the plan would work.
“We cannot wait for purity tests,” Buttigieg said. “We have to just get something done. ”
O’Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they’re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups.
Buttigieg said the problem isn’t the polls; the problem is the policy.
“I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” Buttigieg added. “Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. ”
O’Rourke then said Buttigieg’s “shiny object” description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting.
Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to “actually deliver a solution. ”
Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg’s criticism when asked what’s wrong with a mandatory buyback program.
“I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,” she said. “Let’s not mess this up with this fight. ”
Kamala Harris, when asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets.
“I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,” the former prosecutor said. “I’m done and we need action. ”
– Maureen Groppe
9:46 p. m. EDT
O'Rourke, Gabbard, Steyer getting less air time
It’s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don’t get much of a chance to talk.
While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case.
According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time
Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts.
She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words.
On the other end, Beto O’Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words.

9:42 p. m. EDT
Democrats debate troop presence in Middle East
Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria.
"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East," Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. "I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way. "
Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific.
"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East," tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. "We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security. ”
Warren’s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U. S. -allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next.
“So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U. S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,” Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg.
“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy,” Buttigieg responded. “What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. ”
Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform.
– David Jackson and John Fritze
9:38 p. m. EDT
Steyer: Trump’s America First ‘worst idea I’ve ever heard’
Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U. S. economy.
“We can’t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,” the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. “We have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word. ”
“We’re going to have to lead the world morally,” he continued. “We’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way. ”
– Ledyard King
9:29 p. m. EDT
'Dude gotta go'
Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what’s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump’s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added.
“That’s why Dude gotta go,” Harris said.
9:27 p. m. EDT
Biden on Syria: ‘Most shameful thing’
Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U. S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region?
Biden called Trump’s decision the “most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U. S. allied Kurds in Syria.
Biden said he believed the U. S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back.
The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump’s move in Syria but who have also called for the U. S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment.
“What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,” said Pete Buttigieg.
– John Fritze and David Jackson
9:08 p. m. EDT
Warren emerges as biggest target
In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals’ slings and arrows.
On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she’s wearing the bullseye.
On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All plan that they said was costly and unrealistic.
On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her ”ultra-millionaire tax” as the best plan.
“We just have different approaches,” Klobuchar told Warren. “Your idea is not the only idea. ”
Beto O’Rourke piled on: “I think it’s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other. ”
– Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian
9 p. m. EDT
Billionaires under fire, even from the billionaire
Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich.
Even the rich agreed.
Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn’t go that far, but he did say that the country could not “afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. ”
Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders’ assessment.
“Sanders is right,” Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. “There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government. ”
Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: “Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. ”
– John Fritze
8:53 p. m. EDT
Andrew Yang likes 'spirit' of Green New Deal, not job guarantee
Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn’t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans a $1,000 monthly “dividend. ”
Yang said he likes the “spirit” of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation.
But “the fact is most Americans don’t want to work for the federal government,” Yang said. “And saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace. ”
Yang said he’s rather put money directly in American’s pocket than rely on government to address the problem because “it will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. ”
– Ledyard King
8:51 p. m. EDT
Harris draws applause for raising abortion amid healthcare fray
Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights.
“There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,” she said.
She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color “will die” because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being “out of touch” with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights.
– Courtney Subramanian
8:37 p. m. EDT
Klobuchar: Where will we 'send the invoice' for health plan?
Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn’t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans.
Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All, has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down.
Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families.
"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families. ” Warren said.
Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question – what he called an example of why people are “so frustrated with Washington. ”
“I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,” Buttigieg said.
Warren said Buttigieg’s “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal is really “Medicare for All Who Can Afford It. ”
“That’s the problem we’ve got,” she said. “Medicare for All is the gold standard. ”
Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive. ​
“I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice," Klobuchar said.
"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done," she said.
Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs.
"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,” Sanders shot back.
– Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian
8:23 p. m. EDT
Biden demurs on Hunter Biden question
Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s lead on that country?
Biden largely demurred on the question.
“Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,” Biden said.
“My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. “What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I’m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made. ”
The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden’s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China.
Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a "mistake" and showed “poor judgement” in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything "improper" in the Ukraine.
Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump’s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump’s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue.
– John Fritze
8:20 p. m. EDT
Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment
Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump’s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight.
Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump’s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president’s interactions with Ukraine.
“Impeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,” he said.
– Courtney Subramanian
8:17 p. m. EDT
Klobuchar makes first Syria reference
President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U. S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U. S. -allied Kurds.
It didn’t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office.
Klobuchar asked how "leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter" would make "Make America Great Again. "
Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours.
– John Fritze
8:11 p. m. EDT
First question is about impeachment
The debate launched with a question about House Democrat’s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn’t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked.
“Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,” she said.
Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history.
“I agree with Bernie,” Joe Biden echoed.
Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats’ investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act.
Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long.
“As a former prosecutor,” Harris said. “I know a confession when I see it. ”
– Maureen Groppe
And they’re off
8 p. m. EDT
The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders’ recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about.
Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments.

Trump, RNC announce $125. 7 million fundraising haul
7:50 p. m. EDT
Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large.
The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125. 7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate.
In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand.
“President Trump’s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said.
According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44. 50.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders.

Battle of the young guys: Beto v. Buttigieg
7:40 p. m. EDT
Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.
The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for “Medicare for All” and instead touting his “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan.
Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O’Rourke made headlines over in the last debate.
Earlier this month O’Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat’s “Good Luck America. ”
“I get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,” Buttigieg said Monday.
O’Rourke responded in a tweet: “Pete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a ‘shiny object. ’ He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year. ”

Pelosi delivers debate question to stage
7:15 p. m. EDT
The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine – to name a few.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago? Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now.
Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don’t need to do that – and the Constitution doesn’t explicitly require it – but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won’t provide documents absent a vote.

Dems send signal by debating in Ohio
7:05 p. m. EDT
President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican.
When Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of "The Bellwether. "
By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they’re not conceding the state.
"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands," Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations.
Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That’s why Tuesday night’s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average. That’s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held.
So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.

Bloomberg: Are we hiring a legislator in chief?
7 p. m. EDT
Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he’s eager to remain in the mix.
Bloomberg – who initially announced he wouldn’t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he’d consider it if Biden falters – writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things.
“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who’s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani.
“The job’s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,” Bloomberg writes. “The country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief. ”
Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people “who are smarter than you. ”
So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well.
“Mostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,” Bloomberg wrote, “while also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news. ”

Are you smarter than a bookie?
6:50 p. m. EDT
Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight’s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said.
Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting. ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden).
If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you’re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40. 5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3. 5. )

AOC's barb at Mayor Pete
6:45 p. m. EDT
A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party’s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate.
Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his “Medicare for all who want it” health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren “believe that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,’ where private insurance is abolished. ”
The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders.
Buttigieg’s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren’s eschewing small donor strategy: “We're not going to beat Trump with pocket change. ”
In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg “insults” has outraised him.
And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that “numerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate. ”
“Mayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,” the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday.
Trump's one-word attack
6:40 p. m. EDT
The Trump campaign’s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism.
In a full-page ad in today’s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats’ “big government socialism will wreck Ohio’s economy. ”
Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted “SOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS. ”
The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by “ending fossil fuels. ”

What to expect
5:50 p. m. EDT
The Westerville debate is the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will take the stage two weeks after having a heart attack.
And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case – through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers – for why she should be considered the frontrunner.
Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2.
October Democratic debate: Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know
The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times.
They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters.
– Maureen Groppe
Tom Steyer enters the fray
On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump.
A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson.
The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate.
Impeachment: 5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate
– Maureen Groppe
A more aggressive Biden?
Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge.
Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter.
Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden repeatedly admitted he made a "mistake" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president.
So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds?
“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden said at the fundraiser. “Which is good, I’m not complaining, I’m a big boy,” he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don’t allow time for full answers.
– Maureen Groppe
Likable enough?
While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters.
The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn’t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him.

Left of Obama; Few of his judges make a "progressive" wish list for the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: This column is not the first to notice that Democratic politicians seem to spend about half the day accusing President Trump of trashing vaguely defined Constitutional norms—and the other half explaining how they plan to trash enumerated Constitutional rights. As for the latter activity, Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate is another opportunity for candidates to show how much damage they intend to inflict on the first two Amendments. Now prominent activists are demanding that candidates promise to be more radical than America's 44th President.
Seung Min Kim writes in the Washington Post today:
Democratic presidential contenders are coming under increased pressure from their base to take a page from Donald Trump's 2016 playbook and release a shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees — one part of a larger strategy from party activists to make the courts a central issue in the 2020 race.
Demand Justice, a group founded to counteract the conservative wing's decades-long advantage over liberals in judicial fights, will release a list of 32 suggested Supreme Court nominees for any future Democratic president as they ramp up their push for the 2020 contenders to do the same.
The slate of potential high court picks includes current and former members of Congress, top litigators battling the Trump administration's initiatives in court, professors at the nation's top law schools and public defenders. Eight are sitting judges. They have established track records in liberal causes that Demand Justice hopes will energize the liberal base.
What's interesting is that Demand Justice is not a Sandernista fringe group. It's run by Brian Fallon, who has impeccable Democratic establishment credentials according to the group's website :
Fallon worked as the Director of Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of Justice during the Obama administration. Prior to that, he was a top aide in the United States Senate, working for New York Democrat Chuck Schumer.
In 2016, Fallon served as the National Press Secretary for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He appears frequently on MSNBC and CNN to discuss national politics from a progressive perspective.
Fallon is a 2003 graduate of Harvard College.
It's also interesting, as a commentary on how far and how fast his party has been moving leftward, that he and his "progressive" friends don't seem to trust most of the people his old boss appointed to the federal bench. "Justice on Trial" co-author Carrie Severino notes on Twitter :
Amazing: there must be hundreds of federal judges Obama put on the courts, and only 4 make this list. This list would have been way too liberal for Obama.
...Only 8 of the 32 potential nominees on this list have judicial experience. Which makes sense - they're looking for activists, not judges.
The bet here is that voters still prefer a President who's looking for judges.

Executive Producers of The Impeachment Show
"Why can't we see the witnesses testify?," writes Noah Weiland in the New York Times. Mr. Weiland then does his best to answer the question:
My colleague Nick Fandos, who was on Capitol Hill today, explained to me why Democrats are doing so much out of public view:
The Democrats are trying to collect as much information as possible as quickly as possible. Big made-for-TV hearings are a chaotic and clunky way to try to build a body of evidence. They allow witnesses to line up their stories in advance and could easily backfire on Democrats trying to build a public narrative in real time.
Most congressional veterans would tell you that from a fact-finding point of view, you are better off following the Watergate model: Investigate in private first, then choreograph a series of public hearings that recreate for the public what the investigation found. Republicans, nevertheless, are accusing Democrats of impeaching a president in secret.
Are Republicans really the only ones bothered by Democrats "doing so much out of public view" to "build a public narrative" and then "choreograph a series of public hearings"?

LeBron's Favorite Dictator
China's communist strongman Xi Jinping is surely enjoying comments from NBA star LeBron James discouraging criticism of Mr. Xi's regime. The BBC reports that the Beijing tyrant is also doing his part to discourage free speech:
China's president has issued a warning against dissent, saying any attempt to divide China will end in "bodies smashed and bones ground to powder".
Xi Jinping's comments came during a state visit to Nepal on Sunday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
He didn't mention any particular region but it was seen as a warning to Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing protests have been ongoing for months.
"Anyone who attempts to split any region from China will perish," said Mr Xi, according to the BBC. Adds government-run China Daily:
Those who engage in separatist activities in any part of China will be smashed into pieces, Xi said, adding that external support for separatists will be seen by the Chinese people as delusional.
Is it delusional to believe the NBA will not enhance its global brand by seeking to please dictators?

Bolton decried Ukraine 'drug deal,' Fiona Hill testifies, reports say

Resumen: Fiona Hill, an ex-White House adviser on Russia, reportedly testified that Bolton called Giuliani "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted no part of what he derided as the White House's "drug deal" to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a former White House official told congressional investigators on Monday, according to reports of her testimony from The New York Times and NBC News.
Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, spent more than 10 hours fielding questions from three House panels behind closed doors.
Her testimony was part of an impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump used military aid as leverage to get the Ukrainians to dig into an energy company that included the former vice president's son Hunter on its board. Ukrainian officials have said they uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.
Hill testified that Bolton told her to inform National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg of the push for a fresh investigation by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the U. S. ambassador to the European Union, the reports said.
Mulvaney, Giuliani and Sondland also wanted Ukrainian officials to explore the possibility of a Ukrainian role in 2016 election interference.
This week in the impeachment inquiry: A deadline for Rudy Giuliani, more Capitol Hill meetings
Hill said Bolton advised her to contact Eisenberg after a July 10 meeting with senior Ukrainian officials in which Sondland brought up the issue of investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Bolton told her he wasn't part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," unnamed sources who witnessed Hill's testimony told the Times. He also reportedly referred to Giuliani as "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up. "
"I always liked and respected John," Giuliani said of Bolton in response to Hill's testimony, according to NBC News. "I’m very disappointed that his bitterness drives him to attack a friend falsely and in a very personal way. It’s really ironic that John Bolton is calling anyone else a hand grenade. When John is described by many as an atomic bomb. "
Fiona Hill: Former Trump Russia adviser Fiona Hill testifies for 10 hours in impeachment probe
Hill told lawmakers that Giuliani's role circumvented the normal national security processes and procedures for forming foreign policy.
The Times reported that she confronted Sondland about what she considered the rogue foreign policy he was instituting in Ukraine, which is not part of the EU and therefore not normally under the ambassador to the EU's purview.
Sondland told her that he was in charge of Ukraine. When she asked who had given him that authority, he replied that the president had, according to the Times.
Sondland is expected to testify Thursday.

Report details video played at conference

Texto completo: The White House says President Donald Trump hasn't seen the violent video edited to depict him carrying out a massacre of news organizations and political opponents, but he does condemn the contents being reported.
The statement comes as questions about the video and its use continue to swirl and as the people "killed" in the video continue to react.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
In the edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," Trump as the face of Colin Firth's character enters a "Church of Fake News" and opens fire on members of the congregation.
The churchgoers have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday morning that the president has not yet viewed the video, but condemns its contents based on reports. She said he will see it shortly. Trump has not directly responded.
Trump's character shoots, stabs and sets fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.; 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.; and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, among others.
The video also shows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is currently involved in pursuing the impeachment inquiry into Trump.
Several news outlets are depicted being killed in the rampage, including Politico, NPR, HuffPost, The Washington Post, Slate and CNN.
The White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.
"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society," Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.
"The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone," a CNN statement reads.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday evening, "Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN – and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn't funny. It will get people killed.
An organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown but denounced its showing as part of a "meme exhibit" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. "This matter is under review," said the organizer Alex Phillips.
Phillips also said on the conference's website it was "shocking" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, "Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved."

Texto completo: For Notre Dame fans, this football weekend was a twofer. Not only did the Irish beat a longtime rival, the University of Southern California, on Saturday, the campus was treated to a sight it had never before seen: the attorney general of the United States, at a pregame tailgater, serenading faculty, students and fans with his bagpipes.
Turns out that was William Barr's second performance on campus. The first came at the law school Friday, when he delivered a bracing speech on the role of religion in the American story of freedom.
The attorney general advanced two broad propositions. First, the waning of religion's influence in American life has left more of her citizens vulnerable to what Tocqueville called the "soft despotism" of government dependency. Second, today's secularists are decidedly not of the live-and-let-live variety.
"The secular project has itself become a religion, pursued with religious fervor," he said. "It is taking on all the trappings of religion, including inquisitions and excommunication. Those who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake -- social, educational and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns."
Right out of central casting, critics stepped forward to prove his point. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman accused Mr. Barr of "religious bigotry" and described his words as a "pogrom type speech."
Political ethicist and professional attention seeker Richard Painter tapped out a series of even more furious tweets, here calling the speech the latest episode of "The Handmaid's Tale," there suggesting Mr. Barr isn't much of a Christian, here again saying Mr. Barr sounded like "vintage Goebbels." Over at MSNBC, meanwhile, retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, once chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, told Joy Reid the attorney general is "Torquemada in a business suit," a reference to the Spanish Inquisition's grand inquisitor.
This is what we have come to expect when someone in public life mentions religion in a positive light. Many didn't like Mr. Barr's blaming secularism for social pathologies such as drug addiction, family breakdown and increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males. Yet few engaged his more arresting contention, which is that all these problems have spiritual roots. Whereas religion addresses such challenges by stressing personal responsibility, Mr. Barr argued, the state's answer is merely to try to alleviate "bad consequences."
"So the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion," he said. "The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the state to set itself up as an ersatz husband for the single mother and an ersatz father for the children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with this wreckage -- and while we think we're solving problems, we are underwriting them."
Vincent Phillip Munoz, a Notre Dame professor, notes there was nothing particularly Catholic about this speech. Like Washington in his Farewell Address, he says, Mr. Barr focused on the irreplaceable role of religion in cultivating the morality citizens need to be capable of self-government.
"The speech wasn't first and foremost about religious freedom," says Mr. Munoz. "It was about the human and social consequences of the new secular morality, and what happens when the state views its citizens not only in purely material terms, but as subjects who can't really govern themselves."
Even those who strongly disagree with Mr. Barr ought to have found this an invitation for thoughtful and vigorous debate. But rather than engage, some imply there is something unseemly about an attorney general's even speaking at a Catholic university. Given the hostility that holding such a conversation engenders on campuses today, perhaps America can count itself fortunate it still has a university where this can happen.
Carter Snead, the law professor who invited Mr. Barr, puts it this way: "At Notre Dame, we are not afraid to explore the hard questions about God, religion and America together in friendship, especially on those matters about which people strongly disagree."
Mr. Barr's argument has been echoed throughout American history: "Our Constitution was made for only for a moral and religious people" (John Adams). "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith" (Tocqueville). "In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For 'not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God' shall our democracy be founded" (FDR). And so on.
That so many would become unhinged by Mr. Barr's relatively modest contribution to the genre is highly revealing of the absolutism of secularist opponents determined to marginalize and destroy anyone who dares dissent from their own uncompromising orthodoxy.

Texto completo: MISS JUNE
At ONCE Ballroom, Somerville,
Oct. 15. at 8 p.m. Tickets $12, www.oncesomerville.com
On the day I'm scheduled to interview New Zealand pop-punk band Miss June, Instagram targets me with a personality quiz that says it can tell me which member of the formidable foursome I am. The quiz declares me a “Chris."
When I reach Miss June singer/guitarist Annabel Liddell on the phone while she's on the road in the United Kingdom and ask what that says about me, she breaks into giggles. It means the quiz is broken, she says. Everybody so far has been a Chris.
It's not a bad thing to be Chris Marshall, the band's bassist, she assures me. “Nice guy, good hair!" she says.
People ask Liddell “all the time" if she's Miss June, but the band is named after the Brian Jonestown Massacre song “Miss June '75," and the name was picked in a rush. The band consists of Liddell, Marshall, guitarist Jun Park, and drummer Tom Leggett, and it formed “about four years ago." Liddell had a solo gig, realized she didn't want to do it alone, sprinted into the jazz school, found three guys who were willing to learn her songs quickly — and the lineup hasn't changed since then.
2019 has been a banner year. The fuzzed-out Kiwi band signed to New York's indie-playground label Frenchkiss Records, their debut LP's sizzling lead single “Best Girl" landed on The New York Times's exclusive Playlist, and the album, “Bad Luck Party," drew raves from all around the music blogosphere. On top of that, Liddell is set to graduate from medical school in New Zealand next month, right after the band comes home from its two-month tour across Europe and the United States.
The band will be playing tunes from “Bad Luck Party," and some unreleased new material too, when it brings the noise to ONCE in Somerville on Tuesday.
Q. How did you balance being a med student and a musician?
A. I've balanced it the best that I can. At the end of last year, I had really worked myself into the ground. Honestly, working all day, every single day, without fail. I was doing the best I could, and I have a great support network. My family and the boys in the band are really supportive.
Q. When you were in the depths of medical school, when did you find time to write?
A. So first of all, I had a two-year break from writing. That was during the time that I was doing all the academia. For med school, you have three years which are pretty much theory before you get in the hospital. I was working so hard, and I stopped writing, but then once I got into the hospital work, I found a lot of inspiration. My mind was more active. And so I used to keep my writing guitar in the same room as my study. I'd cram for a couple hours and then take a break, make coffee, and pick up the guitar as a break from studying.

Q. Is there a story behind your Twitter and Instagram handles, “@ihatemissjune?"
A. We were playing a gig, and a bunch of Jun's friends came to the show. They all made these T-shirts, and on the back of the T-shirts they wrote “[Expletive] Miss June," just as a joke. And they were moshing in the front, getting so into it with these “[Expletive] Miss June" T-shirts on! We thought it was really funny. Obviously, we couldn't make our Instagram handle “[Expletive] Miss June," so we went with “I Hate Miss June."
Q. Tell me about the way that the band writes songs. Are they mostly yours, is it a collaborative process?
A. In the early days of Miss June, I was very much doing the lion's share of the songwriting. I remember we had a conversation about it, where the boys were like, “We want to contribute more." And I'm like, “Cool. Let's try to do this more collaboratively." That's the newest sort of song for us. Some of those heavier songs like “Enemies" and “Aquarium" were riffs that Jun wrote on guitar and brought in, and then I put vocals on.
Q. What inspired “Best Girl?"
A. I am from a tiny island on the bottom of the Earth, and it has a very small population. Because of that constant close proximity with other people, it's really important to be supportive of each other. That's something New Zealand can struggle with a little bit.
I wrote “Best Girl" from the perspective of being a young female musician growing up in a small town. And basically just feeling the weight of expectation, and the patriarchal construct that says there's only room for one woman on the lineup, or there's only room for one girl in the band. And it's this mentality that forces us to compete with other women, and it's just not necessary or true. In my mind it's another form of oppression.
What I've been seeing recently is a lot of marginalized people, a lot of women, rising up and saying, “[Expletive] your old system, we're actually going to do our own thing." The song is about this pursuit of this goal that doesn't exist . . . “If I'm the best girl, I'll be happy, no one can win but me, I have to be the one." Which actually isn't true. There's enough room for everybody to succeed in their own right.

God Is Now Trump's Co-Conspirator

Texto completo: Bigotry, both racial and religious, is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Listening to the speech William Barr, the attorney general, gave last week at the University of Notre Dame Law School, I found myself thinking of the title of an old movie: "God Is My Co-Pilot." What I realized is that Donald Trump's minions have now gone that title one better: If Barr's speech is any indication, their strategy is to make God their boss's co-conspirator.
Given where we are right now, you might have expected Barr to respond in some way to the events of the past few weeks -- the revelation that the president has been calling on foreign regimes to produce dirt on his domestic opponents, the airport arrest of associates of the president's lawyer as they tried to leave the country on one-way tickets, credible reports that Rudy Giuliani himself is under criminal investigation.
Alternatively, Barr could have delivered himself of some innocuous pablum, which is something government officials often do in difficult times.
But no. Barr gave a fiery speech denouncing the threat to America posed by "militant secularists," whom he accused of conspiring to destroy the "traditional moral order," blaming them for rising mental illness, drug dependency and violence.
Consider for a moment how inappropriate it is for Barr, of all people, to have given such a speech. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion; the nation's chief law enforcement officer has no business denouncing those who exercise that freedom by choosing not to endorse any religion.
And we're not talking about a tiny group, either. These days, around a fifth of Americans say that they don't consider themselves affiliated with any religion, roughly the same number who consider themselves Catholic. How would we react if the attorney general denounced Catholicism as a force undermining American society?
And he didn't just declare that secularism is bad; he declared that the damage it does is intentional: "This is not decay. It is organized destruction." If that kind of talk doesn't scare you, it should; it's the language of witch hunts and pogroms.
It seems almost beside the point to note that Barr's claim that secularism is responsible for violence happens to be empirically verifiable nonsense. America has certainly become less religious over the past quarter century, with a large rise in the number of religiously unaffiliated and growing social liberalism on issues like same-sex marriage; it has also seen a dramatic decline in violent crime. European nations are far less religious than we are; they also have much lower homicide rates, and rarely experience the mass shootings that have become almost routine here.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Nonetheless, William Barr -- again, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, responsible for defending the Constitution -- is sounding remarkably like America's most unhinged religious zealots, the kind of people who insist that we keep experiencing mass murder because schools teach the theory of evolution. Guns don't kill people -- Darwin kills people!
So what's going on here? Pardon my cynicism, but I seriously doubt that Barr, whose boss must be the least godly man ever to occupy the White House, has suddenly realized to his horror that America is becoming more secular. No, this outburst of God-talk is surely a response to the way the walls are closing in on Trump, the high likelihood that he will be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Trump's response to his predicament has been to ramp up the ugliness in an effort to rally his base. The racism has gotten even more explicit, the paranoia about the deep state more extreme. But who makes up Trump's base? The usual answer is working-class whites, but a deeper dive into the data suggests that it's more specific: It's really evangelical working-class whites who are staying with Trump despite growing evidence of his malfeasance and unsuitability for high office.
And at a more elite level, while a vast majority of Republican politicians have meekly fallen in line behind Trump, his truly enthusiastic support comes from religious leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr., who have their own ethical issues, but have called on their followers to "render to God and Trump."
Patriotism, Samuel Johnson famously declared, is the last refuge of scoundrels. But for all his talk of America first, that's not a refuge that works very well for Trump, with his subservience to foreign autocrats and, most recently, his shameful betrayal of the Kurds.
So Trump is instead taking shelter behind bigotry -- racial, of course, but now religious as well.
Will it work? There is a substantial minority of Americans with whom warnings about sinister secularists resonate. But they are a minority. Over all, we're clearly becoming a more tolerant nation, one in which people have increasingly positive views of others' religious beliefs, including atheism.
So the efforts of Trump's henchmen to use the specter of secularism to distract people from their boss's sins probably won't work. But I could be wrong. And if I am wrong, if religious bigotry turns out to be a winning strategy, all I can say is, God help us.

12 Things You Need To Know About Ohio

Texto completo: The 2020 Democratic hopefuls will debate in a state that has voted for the winning presidential candidate every time since 1944, with one exception.
As the 2020 Democratic candidates descend Tuesday on Westerville, Ohio, a northern suburb of Columbus, for the fourth presidential debate, here are 12 fast facts about politics and the economy in the Buckeye State that could help shape the upcoming election.
Ohio is a historically accurate presidential predictor
The state is typically a reliable weather vane on election night: It has voted for the eventual presidential winner every time since 1944 except once, in 1960, when Ohioans chose Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy. In 2004, Ohio provided the Electoral College votes that put President George W. Bush over the top.
Many strategists no longer consider it a battleground state
In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a blowout eight points in Ohio -- more than in Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia -- leading many strategists to remove the state from the map of presidential battlegrounds. Ohio Democrats, however, are not yet willing to admit they live in a red state, pointing to last year's midterm elections, where...
Sherrod Brown easily won re-election as a progressive
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, won 53.4 percent of the vote in 2018, running a campaign that emphasized working-class economic issues.
And Democrats flipped six seats in the statehouse last year
Democrats in 2018 flipped six seats in the statehouse from red to blue, including three in the Columbus suburbs, reflecting a national pendulum swing away from Mr. Trump by white college-educated independents and Republican women.
Republicans have a lot of power statewide
On the other hand, Republicans won every state constitutional office in 2018 from governor on down, in a year when Democrats captured top offices in other northern industrial states including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Trump's approval rating in Ohio is no better than the national average
Mr. Trump's approval rating in the state, now at 43 percent, is not much better than the national average of 42 percent and worse than in "safe" red states. A recent survey by Emerson Polling found that 54 percent of women in the state disapprove of Mr. Trump. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders all outpolled Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups. Forty-seven percent of Ohio voters support impeachment, the survey found.
Trump promised to reverse the decline in manufacturing jobs, but he hasn't
The long-term decline of manufacturing, which fueled Mr. Trump's victory in Ohio, has continued, but the state's transition to a service economy has salved some wounds. General Motors, once Ohio's largest employer, today ranks 72nd, while the Cleveland Clinic is No. 1, with Walmart close behind.
The closing of a General Motors plant had major repercussions
The idling of a G.M. factory near Youngstown, Ohio, this year cost thousands of jobs, years after Mr. Trump visited, promising that the jobs were "all coming back." But the closure may not sour all the rank-and-file union autoworkers who voted for him. Some white working-class voters are determined "to go down with the ship with him," a union official told The Times recently.
Democrats are losing blue-collar voters
Although black voter turnout in Ohio declined by 7.5 points from 2012 to 2016, according to one analysis of voting data, that does not come close to accounting for Mrs. Clinton's loss there. Instead, Mr. Trump won white voters in Ohio by a much larger margin than the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
The political bottom line: Democrats in Ohio, as elsewhere, are winning over suburbanites while losing white blue-collar voters in places like northeast Ohio. Many strategists consider it a long-term trade-off that will outlast the Trump era.
The site of the debate is turning blue
Westerville, with above average family income, education levels and home prices, is the home of former Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who ran in the 2016 presidential primary, but the community is trending blue. It voted for Mr. Romney in 2012 but Mrs. Clinton in 2016. There was a 29-point swing toward the Democrats between 2016 and 2018 in Senate and House races, according to an analysis by Cleveland.com.
Columbus is on the rise
Columbus, with an economy anchored by banking, insurance and higher education, fits the profile of a Sun Belt city plopped down in the Midwest: It is one of the 15 fastest growing metropolises in the country, and the only one on the list in the Midwest.
And one more thing...
Columbus is home to The Ohio State University. Do not omit the article. And on Big Ten football game days, Michigan is pronounced "the state up north."

Texto completo: Even in the midst of an impeachment inquiry, President Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria, enabling a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters, has prompted howls of protest — including from prominent Republicans who otherwise can barely bring themselves to utter a critical word.
The critics have a point. There are good reasons to wring one’s hands, but there is also a cogent “America First” argument to be made in favor of withdrawal — even if declaring policy with a surprise tweet isn’t the way to go about it. There is a third way to look at it, as well: The cynic’s view of how America often conducts foreign policy.
So overall, which viewpoint has the most merit? Let’s go with the cynical one.
The hand-wringers’ list of worries is well documented, and it was summed up by conservative columnist Bret Stephens in the New York Times. The first concern is the moral cost of abandoning an ally: Allowing Turkey to invade leaves the Kurds, who did America’s dirty work fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, to face a vastly superior force alone.
But the move also damages Washington’s reputation as an ally; gives the Islamic State a chance to regroup; encourages Iran and Russia (which, a New York Times investigation shows, is bombing hospitals in Syria); and it gives Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a chance to strengthen his hand domestically. Also: It may increase the possibility of a conflict between Iran and Israel.
Evangelical Christian leaders, who normally are big Trump backers, also are upset. Pat Robertson declared that Trump risks “losing the mandate of heaven” by abandoning the Kurds. Wow.
(For an explanation of the long-running conflict between the Turkish government and Kurdish groups, check out this Council on Foreign Relations primer.)
A lot of the criticism is accurate, and it is likely to be reflected in an overwhelming, bipartisan effort in Congress to impose sanctions on Turkey for its military action. It comes at a time of political peril for Trump. Even if the Lindsey Grahams of this world won’t criticize him over the Ukraine scandal, this will fuel their private doubts about Trump’s temperament and leadership.
Trump doesn’t appear to care. Pulling back in Syria is popular with the part of his base that loves the “America First” message, and it allows Trump to portray himself as someone willing to make tough decisions.
U.S. policy on Syria has been a muddle throughout the eight-year civil war. The United States either didn’t have much of a chance to influence events there, or didn’t care enough to try. In addition to hunting Islamic State figures, U.S. forces have been making a difference around the margins — balancing the Iranians and Russians and keeping the Turks and Kurds apart — not pushing events toward a solution. Without a solution, it’s easy to see American troops doing much the same thing in Syria for a long time to come — precisely the kind of deployment Trump wants to end. You could cast Trump’s pullback as what happens when a superpower gets tired. It reduces commitments. People get hurt. This time, it’s the Kurds.
But if America is rethinking its role, it would best move slowly and only after making sure everyone knew where Washington’s new boundaries were. That didn’t happen.
Plus, if the president truly believes that “going into the Middle East is one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country,” why, exactly, are more troops heading to the region? The Pentagon announced Friday it is sending additional forces to Saudi Arabia, bringing to 3,000 the number dispatched since an attack on Saudi oil facilities last month. Overall, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said 14,000 U.S. troops had been added to the region since May, according to Politico.
Policy toward both Syria and Saudi Arabia is in part about confronting Iran. But let’s give the cynics their due. The United States cares more about Saudi Arabia, which has a lot of oil, than Syria, which has much less. That calculation is even more true for Trump. The Saudis know how to flatter him, and — despite the objections of Congress — they’ve made him complicit in their humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen. In turn, Trump has shielded them from fallout in the death and dismemberment of dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
Everyone knows this isn’t the first time the United States encouraged the Kurds, and then stood by and watched them die. It happened at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991, as well. So why did they trust the Americans this time? Because, says Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Kurds have little choice: “The United States is powerful and can afford to be duplicitous, whereas the Kurds are weak and are thus forced to be credulous.”
Trump’s decision could — probably will — harm U.S. interests. On Sunday, the Kurds cut a deal with the Syrian government, which is propped up by Iran and Russia.
This may also prove to be one more example of the kind of calculation the United States often makes. And what might most distinguish it is not the withdrawal itself, but the typically shambolic way a president impressed by his own “great and unmatched wisdom” went about it.

Billionaires are good

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders' last stand for his fading presidential dreams rests on a final attack on emerging front-runner Elizabeth Warren from the Left. Despite them endorsing the same multitrillion-dollar programs to nationalize vast swaths of the economy, Sanders has lambasted Warren as a "capitalist," which the Massachusetts senator herself has conceded. Sanders says that he is not.
"I mean, Elizabeth considers herself, if I got the quote correctly, to be a capitalist to her bones. I don’t," Sanders told ABC on Sunday. "And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary."
Although the media has rallied behind Warren, luxuriating in her many bad plans and running interference for her history of lying about her background, they've taken to Bernie's various calls to arms. The pattern is simple.
First, Bernie writes up a new bumper sticker:TweetThen some willing sheep in the media turns it into a think piece:TweetRepeat as necessary until desired effects are seen.
This works just as well with his policy proposals, which are all contingent on demanding a punitive system of taxation.
On Oct. 9:TweetThen 48 hours later:TweetAnd scene.
But now that the media's begun taking the socialist ramblings of a septuagenarian Soviet-wannabe seriously, it's worth asking these two inextricably linked questions in earnest: Are billionaires really failing to pay their fair share, and do they even have the right to exist?
The first question is far more straightforward, and the falsehood purveyed by Sanders' lackeys is even easier to debunk.
The New York Times piece, written by two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, determines the tax burden of income percentile intervals using six forms of taxation: consumption, payroll, residential property, corporate and business property, estate, and income taxes.
Predictably, for all but the top tenth of earners, consumption and payroll taxes comprise the overwhelming majority of taxation. Consumption, payroll, and mostly insignificant residential property taxes are regressive. Income taxes take fewer than 5% of the earnings of the bottom 50%. Regressive taxes still outpace income taxation for the middle class, with income taxation only taking over for the top 10%.
By the article's own admission, its total calculated tax rates per income percentile increase in a progressive manner. But even the calculation itself ignores economic realities to paint a dishonest narrative.
For starters, payroll taxes are not supposed to be explicitly redistributive, even if their output manifests itself in means-tested benefits as well as straightforward entitlements, meaning that they're regressive by design. Social Security's most vocal supporters defend it by claiming that it simply pays you back your money, even though in practice we know it's an effective generational wealth transfer.
It logically follows that if lower-income earners often pay zero in their effective income tax rates while the wealthy pay double digit percentage points, the payroll tax burden will be greater in relation to total income for lower-income earners. The same goes for consumption taxes, not by design in terms of a specific program, but by virtue of lower-income earners spending a greater percentage of their income on consumer goods than higher-income earners.
Transactional taxes such as standard consumption taxes and VAT taxes are good for the economy because they encourage wealthier Americans to invest and save more rather than spend irresponsibly. Furthermore, no serious economist is looking at taxes not even reported to the IRS as evidence of a markedly increased tax burden.Screen Shot 2019-10-14 at 11.20.44 AM.pngNow, look at the graph published by the New York Times, mentally erase the red bars, and consider whether the central thesis still applies. In fact, don't take my word for it. Just listen to Jason Furman, former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.TweetMoreover, as Michael Strain notes at Bloomberg, tax burden estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the U.S. tax code is highly progressive. Whereas the much-hated "1%" pays 33% of their total annual earnings as federal taxes, the lowest one-fifth of income earners pay a measly 2% in federal taxes. If anything, the state and local tax deduction cap in the 2017 tax reform law made the combined state and federal tax burdens even more progressive.
Clearly millionaires (including Sanders) and billionaires are paying their fair share. But should they even exist?
Let's ignore the moral case that the state ought not steal from its own citizens with neither the consent of the governed nor any intention other than income redistribution guided by government greed. Does the existence of billionaires improve the bottom line of American prosperity?
Yes, individual greed is good, and yes, billionaires are good.
Thomas Piketty laid the groundwork for the rallying cry of the pseudo-intellectual left in his assertion that returns on capital tend to outpace returns on labor. Even though this concept is taught in the first few weeks of most high school economics classes, the Piketty cry to eat the rich for the crime of having a more efficient factor of production comes at the detriment of all earning classes.
The only real factors that grow economies, other than legal or political shifts to ease trade or relax burdensome regulations, are investment, entrepreneurship, technological and scientific advances, and increasing the labor force. (This last factor is a large reason why nations that oppress women from joining the workforce hinder their own economic growth.)
If you're into Rawlsian liberalism with the end goal of increasing the bottom line, it makes sense to encourage a VAT tax, as Andrew Yang wants to use to fund a universal basic income. VAT taxes discourage the wealthy from wasting their money through consumption (which doesn't really grow the economy) and instead invest (which absolutely helps grow the economy). It's why we want a capital gains tax that's lower than other forms of income taxes, and the same Wall Street investors that supported Hillary Clinton in droves balk in fear of an Elizabeth Warren presidency threatening to punish investment and thus, crash the economy as a whole.
When we let billionaires become billionaires, they employ hundreds of thousands of people and create trillions of dollars of wealth for the economy overall. When we let billionaires stay billionaires, even the most undeserving of them keep gobs of cash in investments, growing the economy for everyone as they sleep.
Billionaires are paying their fair share, and billionaires are good. Don't be bitter that you aren't one. Be thankful you benefit from the returns on their wealth.

Bill Barr 'Gets' Religion; The attorney general gives a speech on secularism, and the left goes bananas.

Texto completo: For Notre Dame fans, this football weekend was a twofer. Not only did the Irish beat a longtime rival, the University of Southern California, on Saturday, the campus was treated to a sight it had never before seen: the attorney general of the United States, at a pregame tailgater, serenading faculty, students and fans with his bagpipes.
Turns out that was William Barr's second performance on campus. The first came at the law school Friday, when he delivered a bracing speech on the role of religion in the American story of freedom.
The attorney general advanced two broad propositions. First, the waning of religion's influence in American life has left more of her citizens vulnerable to what Tocqueville called the "soft despotism" of government dependency. Second, today's secularists are decidedly not of the live-and-let-live variety.
"The secular project has itself become a religion, pursued with religious fervor," he said. "It is taking on all the trappings of religion, including inquisitions and excommunication. Those who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake—social, educational and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns."
Right out of central casting, critics stepped forward to prove his point. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman accused Mr. Barr of "religious bigotry" and described his words as a "pogrom type speech."
Political ethicist and professional attention seeker Richard Painter tapped out a series of even more furious tweets, here calling the speech the latest episode of "The Handmaid's Tale," there suggesting Mr. Barr isn't much of a Christian, here again saying Mr. Barr sounded like "vintage Goebbels." Over at MSNBC, meanwhile, retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, once chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, told Joy Reid the attorney general is "Torquemada in a business suit," a reference to the Spanish Inquisition's grand inquisitor.
This is what we have come to expect when someone in public life mentions religion in a positive light. Many didn't like Mr. Barr's blaming secularism for social pathologies such as drug addiction, family breakdown and increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males. Yet few engaged his more arresting contention, which is that all these problems have spiritual roots. Whereas religion addresses such challenges by stressing personal responsibility, Mr. Barr argued, the state's answer is merely to try to alleviate "bad consequences."
"So the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion," he said. "The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the state to set itself up as an ersatz husband for the single mother and an ersatz father for the children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with this wreckage—and while we think we're solving problems, we are underwriting them."
Vincent Phillip Muñoz, a Notre Dame professor, notes there was nothing particularly Catholic about this speech. Like Washington in his Farewell Address, he says, Mr. Barr focused on the irreplaceable role of religion in cultivating the morality citizens need to be capable of self-government.
"The speech wasn't first and foremost about religious freedom," says Mr. Muñoz. "It was about the human and social consequences of the new secular morality, and what happens when the state views its citizens not only in purely material terms, but as subjects who can't really govern themselves."
Even those who strongly disagree with Mr. Barr ought to have found this an invitation for thoughtful and vigorous debate. But rather than engage, some imply there is something unseemly about an attorney general's even speaking at a Catholic university. Given the hostility that holding such a conversation engenders on campuses today, perhaps America can count itself fortunate it still has a university where this can happen.
Carter Snead, the law professor who invited Mr. Barr, puts it this way: "At Notre Dame, we are not afraid to explore the hard questions about God, religion and America together in friendship, especially on those matters about which people strongly disagree."
Mr. Barr's argument has been echoed throughout American history: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people" (John Adams). "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith" (Tocqueville). "In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For 'not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God' shall our democracy be founded" (FDR). And so on.
That so many would become unhinged by Mr. Barr's relatively modest contribution to the genre is highly revealing of the absolutism of secularist opponents determined to marginalize and destroy anyone who dares dissent from their own uncompromising orthodoxy.

'Berners for Yang:' Why Some Young Voters Back a New Democratic Outsider; Andrew Yang's presence in the race could pose a hurdle for Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS—A Democratic presidential candidate—running against the establishment and raising millions for his campaign online—drew hundreds of young voters to a union hall here, pitching a radical idea to remake the U.S. economy.
The candidate wasn't Bernie Sanders, but Andrew Yang could benefit from the comparison.
Mr. Yang, a tech entrepreneur, is the new antiestablishment candidate, according to his backers, known as the "Yang Gang," many of whom supported Mr. Sanders in 2016. They are attracted to the idea at the core of his campaign: giving all Americans a payment of $1,000 a month. Mr. Yang says this "freedom dividend" would offset the loss of jobs from automation, which he says is the most urgent crisis Americans are facing.
Mr. Yang, who started as a virtual unknown, raised $10 million in the last quarter. He is now polling in sixth place at an average of 3%—ahead of a dozen other candidates, including current and former elected officials, but well behind Mr. Sanders. His slogan, "Make America Think Harder," shortened to "MATH," is stamped on merchandise and was chanted repeatedly before he walked onstage here.
In an interview in his New York City campaign office, Mr. Yang said there were "a lot of similarities" between him and Mr. Sanders, whom he supported during the 2016 election.

* Andrew Yang Raises $10 Million (Oct. 2)
"We draw in and energize people that haven't been attracted to politics historically," said Mr. Yang. "Bernie and I see some of the same problems and had many of the same goals. But I think, you know, I just have a different set of solutions that speak more to and empower the individual."
Mr. Sanders is in third place nationally, and the Vermont senator appears to have outraised everyone in the field this quarter, with $25.3 million.
Still, both candidates draw the overwhelming share of their support from voters under age 50, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from September. Interviews found they both appeal to independents and others who don't typically vote in Democratic primaries. Mr. Yang's continued presence in the race could pose a hurdle for Mr. Sanders to catch up to former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two front-runners who are distancing themselves from the pack.
Some of Mr. Yang's supporters told The Wall Street Journal that they once backed Mr. Sanders, an independent, but believe his growing influence within the Democratic Party has cost him his outsider status. They also worry that Mr. Sanders's promises to give free health care and college to everyone won't do enough to counter job losses, as companies invest in automation.
"I'm a Berner for Yang," said Valessa Mantona, 30, a retail worker from Henderson. Ms. Mantona said she supported Mr. Sanders during the 2016 primary but feels the relevant issues have changed since the last election.
Bennett Lovaas, a 25-year-old administrative assistant from Henderson, donated to Mr. Sanders's campaign in 2016, but he's mostly settled on supporting Mr. Yang this time. "I think Yang's positions on certain things differ from Bernie's and tend to focus more on fixing the issues instead of almost putting a Band-Aid," Mr. Lovaas said.
Mr. Yang, 44, has described himself to supporters as a version of Mr. Sanders who is "a little bit younger and more Asian and into technology." He showed up to his interview with The Wall Street Journal via bicycle, which includes a small child seat on the back. His campaign manager said the seat, typically used for one of Mr. Yang's two children, doubles as a luggage rack.
"Bernie's solutions tend to be more trying to address the imbalances within institutions without actually just putting the resources in our hands," Mr. Yang said. "Spiritually, our goals are quite aligned."
The Sanders campaign declined to comment.
Mr. Yang has said he doesn't support the "wealth tax" Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have proposed, calling it "somewhere between problematic and a disaster in practice." Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has said he supports a federal jobs guarantee instead of a universal basic income such as Mr. Yang's proposed freedom dividend.
Unlike Mr. Sanders, Mr. Yang is raising money in part through traditional fundraisers. Marc Michel, a New York City-based venture capitalist who is co-hosting a fundraiser for him this month, said he is supporting the entrepreneur, whom he's known for years, because he's making the idea of universal basic income more mainstream. "I'm not expecting it to get adopted in this election cycle, but this is a start of a conversation about it," he said. "Could it happen in two or three election cycles? It's very possible."
Mr. Michel also pointed to a key difference between Mr. Yang and Mr. Sanders.
"We don't hear Andrew bash a billionaire," he said, "or a free-market economy or an innovation economy."
Unlike some elected officials in the Democratic race, Yang has qualified for every Democratic debate and will appear at the CNN/New York Times forum in Ohio Tuesday. But Mr. Yang has substantial ground to make up: In addition to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris are also outpacing him in fundraising and polling.
In interviews with nearly two dozen undecided Democrats in Iowa recently, only one brought up Mr. Yang as one of the candidates on their shortlist. "I work in IT, so I understand what he's talking about on automation," said Wayne Rohret, 49, an IT consultant who lives in Ames, Iowa.
Mr. Rohret was skeptical about Mr. Yang's chances of winning the nomination but added: "I expect him to hang in there for a fair bit."
Another undecided Democrat, Tony Montgomery, 45, of Urbandale, Iowa, didn't consider Mr. Yang among his top choices because of concerns about electability but said he was intrigued.
"He needs to marinate more," Mr. Montgomery said.
Mr. Yang embraces his current position in the polls, going from an unknown to the low-single digits.
"The path is mainly about exceeding expectations," he said.
In Las Vegas, Mr. Yang's speech was peppered with curse words and jokes, and he spoke very little about traditional Democratic priorities—health care, climate change, gun control—instead focusing on his "freedom dividend" pitch.
After the rally, his campaign manager tweeted a video of Mr. Yang skateboarding, weaving around the young supporters who were still hanging around the mostly empty venue.

Texto completo: APPLETON – While attending Appleton West High School, Brad Smith never imagined he'd work for a big company. He thought he'd be a lawyer, a politician or a diplomat.
"I sometimes joke that, in fact, my job involves all three," Smith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in a phone interview to promote an upcoming book-release event at Lawrence University.
Now 60, Smith is president of a little outfit — you might have heard of it — called Microsoft.
He's been described by The New York Times as the tech giant's "elder statesman" and "a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large." He oversees more than 1,400 executive staff in 56 countries, and has testified before Congress.
But it all started, he said, with the lessons and experiences he collected as an idealistic Appleton teenager.
"I've always felt that way," said Smith, a student body president, newspaper editor and school-play pig wrangler at Appleton West who moved from Racine in eighth grade.
"I always thought of Appleton as my hometown."
Agitating and advocating The teenage Smith took a keen interest in the issues facing Appleton, Wisconsin and the wider world, and he debated everything — who should be president or what state policy should be on the ballot — with his mom, Barbara.
"My younger brother in particular ... would always say, 'Stop arguing with mom!'" he said. "And mother would say, 'We're not arguing. We're debating.'"
He brought that love for policy with him to school at Appleton West, where he was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper, The Talisman, and student body president in his junior and senior years.
As a sophomore running to become student body president as a junior, Smith's chances seemed slim. His parents were "very, very supportive of everything I did," he said, but they "were really downplaying the whole election," because they didn't want to get his hopes up.
The evening the votes were counted, in spring 1975, Smith stayed out at the YMCA until 8 p.m. When he got home and told his parents he won — "I still remember, I got 61 percent of the vote," he said — they asked why he hadn't called them earlier with the good news.
"And I said, 'Gee I didn't think that you were that interested in the election,'" he said.
Smith was also part of a student-faculty council that included five faculty members and an administrator, working to improve school policies like the way the National Honor Society selected students or who had access to the hallway.
"I was always agitating or advocating for some kind of change in the local high school," he said.
Smith worked three evenings a week at Shopko his junior year, and later at Fleet Farm in the summer after his senior year. There, "I managed to drive a forklift into a ditch," he said, "but happily survived."
During his junior year, he made what he jokes was his "great theatrical debut" as the props director for the play "Li'l Abner."
"My job was to — among other things — drive to a farm near Hortonville and pick up a little piglet and bring it to the high school theater every evening, so it could appear in the play."
'Values that I grew up with' Part of growing up in Appleton, Smith said, was that you could hop on your bike and get anywhere in town.
"Your parents never worried about you," he said. "That was sort of the slice of middle America that Appleton embodied in the 1970s."
He remembers, as an eighth-grader, a summer of pedaling off to catch Appleton Foxes baseball games. In high school, the social scene was the Friday night basketball game and the dance afterward in the Appleton West gym.
If it was warm, you'd end up at Dairy Queen. If it was cold, Burger King.
"Maybe McDonald's, if you wanted diversity and you wanted to go to a third place," he joked. "But that was pretty much the range of places that we would go."
Smith said he's delighted by how much Appleton has grown, with restaurants and retail by the riverfront — which was "not ... a place where people went for anything." And he's happily noticed how much more ethnically and racially diverse it's become.
His parents moved away the summer after he graduated high school, he said, but he gets back about once a year for Microsoft's TechSpark program, which includes job skills training and computer science education in Brown and Outagamie County schools. Microsoft also partnered with the Green Bay Packers for TitletownTech, a startup and tech innovation lab.
And Smith has donated money to the Appleton Education Foundation and a fund for special projects at Appleton West. Part of his donations were used last year to enable the witch to fly in the "Wizard of Oz" musical production by Appleton West and Wilson Middle School.
"There's little things like that that I like to get back and see," he said.
He still keeps in touch, 42 years after graduating, with two of his former teachers at Appleton West: English teacher Vira Stoner and history teacher Thomas Fanning.
He credits Stoner's contemporary composition class for helping him place among the 10 percent of incoming freshmen at Princeton who tested out of the English requirement. And Fanning, who taught Smith constitutional and diplomatic history and was co-executive secretary of the student-faculty council Smith's senior year, "really encouraged all of us to think very broadly about what was going on around the world and learn from history," Smith said.
Stoner recalled to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin that Smith was a force within the student body, "immediately very successful" in student government and debate club.
Fanning described Smith as intellectually curious and "very much student-minded, as far as the rights of students," he said.
"I taught for 32 years. Over a lifetime of teaching, you're blessed when you have students that just stand out," he said.
Smith's ongoing support of Appleton is "a small repayment on such a large debt," Smith said, to the place where he was exposed to the idea that you could accomplish anything if you were ethically grounded and worked hard enough.
"When I think of Midwestern values the way I was exposed to them in Appleton, I think of being friendly and outgoing. I think about being honest above all else. I think about showing respect for other people. I think of being plainspoken. And I think you find those values in other places too, but they are all values — those were the values that I grew up with."
'Tools and Weapons' Although Smith might have never imagined himself working for one of the most valuable companies in the world by stock market value, his life at Microsoft isn't too far from what he dreamed of as a kid: lawyer, politician or diplomat.
He quite literally is a lawyer, serving as Microsoft's chief legal officer, in addition to being president, since his appointment by CEO Satya Nadella in September 2015.
And Smith also travels around the world as a kind of politician or diplomat for Microsoft on the world stage, like attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or meeting with government leaders to advocate for changes or defend Microsoft.
Smith recounts those experiences as a lawyer, politician and diplomat in the book he co-authored with Carol Ann Browne, Microsoft director of executive communications, "Tools and Weapons."
It's about the tech industry's responsibility to make sure technology like social media and AI is regulated and fostered to benefit people, instead of just pursuing growth at all costs.
Each chapter is rooted in a story — not just stories from Smith and Browne's advocacy around the world, but from history, as well.
"I think I learned at a relatively young age that people don't necessarily like to listen to a lecture but they love to listen to a story," Smith said. "I think this is something I learned in school. I think it's something that I learned going to church as a teenager. You could just watch the reactions of people around you, and you could see when people would sit up straight, perk up, and actually follow what you're saying."
You can see Smith speak about "Tools and Weapons" at the Lawrence University Music-Drama Center, 420 E. College Ave., from 9-10 a.m. Friday. Admission is free.

AJC EDUCATION FOREIGN LANGUAGE: Parlez-vous français? Many kids at Gwinnett school do: Trip Elementary's dual language immersion program thriving.

Texto completo: To learn something that will stick with you for life, it's best to start when you're young.That philosophy drives Gwinnett County Public Schools' Dual Language Immersion Program.
For about a decade, the district has offered an opportunity for students to spend half their school day learning in another language. Six years ago, Trip Elementary began a French Dual Language Immersion Program. Enrollment is voluntary, starting with incoming kindergartners who are guaranteed a spot every year afterward. They are allowed to drop out if the program isn't a good fit, but "I haven't lost a single student," said Principal Rukina Walker.
The first group will move on to middle school at the end of this school year, having pioneered a path for those who come behind them.
The French curriculum must be translated from English, so students in the program are receiving the same lessons as students in traditional classes.
Binta Bin-Wahad, a native of the West African nation of Guinea who grew up speaking French, teaches it in the third-grade DLI class at Trip.
"It may seem like extra work to translate all the lessons, but it's second nature to me," she said.
Katie Basile, the English language teacher in the same class, said there was a little bit of adjustment.
"I trained in France and met with teachers and shared an experience that's so different," she said.
The students start with the new language in kindergarten on the first day.
"It takes them a little while to get used to it, but by the third or fourth week, they've mastered simple words and phrases and are beginning to feel comfortable with the language," said Bin-Wahad.
Her third-graders say they often think in French since math and social studies are the lessons they are taught in French.
"I sometimes have to stop and think about the English word for something in math," said Bella Glasco. Her classmates nodded in agreement. But they all concur that they wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
Maddox Cannon and his family traveled to France over the summer, and he was the only member of the family who spoke the language.
"It was pretty cool that I ordered food for everyone and got directions and stuff like that," he said, smiling. He said the program has gotten him interested in a career in architecture or engineering on an international level.
Similarly, Chinoo Nwosu has aspirations of becoming a translator.
"I already help my mom learn French, so I already have some experience," she said.
Madison Cain also has dreams of putting her French tutelage to work.
Earlier this month, the third-, fourth-and fifth-graders at Trip had a special visit from Rémi Courgeon, a French author and illustrator.Sponsored by the French Embassy, he read from his book "Feather" and talked to the students about French culture.
The experience solidified Madison's determination to be an author herself. "I want to write in English and French," she said.
And although Courgeon's book is also available in English, his presentation was all in French.
The book, a winner of New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books award, tells the story of musical girl who is also tenacious, tough and a fighter. It teaches children about taking charge and realizing their dreams. As he quizzed the kids about how their lives were the same or different from the protagonist's, nods and choruses of "Oui" filled the air. After the story was done, he put them through their paces asking questions that required more detailed responses.
Principal Walker said she's been bowled over by the success of the program.
"The program started my first year as principal here," she said. "I don't speak French, but we've become a French school even for the children that aren't in the program."
There are French words of the day and French words and phrases affixed to walls, and part of the morning announcements are read in French.
"We don't want it to seem like the program is elite," she said. "We include everyone in the learning on some level."
The school has already been in communication with nearby Bay Creek Middle School about the next phase of the program.
"It won't be an immersion program from that point on," said Virin Vedder, DLI coordinator. "We had to write three new courses because these students are more advanced than entry-level French students."
In high school those same kids can take Advanced Placement French and hopefully add foreign language mastery to their diploma.
"We started this program out slow and steady, and we're seeing fantastic results," said Vedder.
Walker agreed.
"There's power in the people, and we've got awesome teachers and world-class support. The students have nowhere to go but up."

MORE DETAILS
According to the Statistical Atlas of the United States,
39,600people in Georgia are native French speakers.
This makes up about 0.4% of the state's population.
Of those, about 80%say they speak English "very well."

Texto completo: Como miles de neoyorquinos que supieron del asesinato de cuatro hombres desamparados en Chinatown, el empresario Hakki Akdeniz expresó su tristeza y recordó que él mismo vivió en las calles.
En una entrevista con The New York Times y PIX11, Akdeniz , de 39 años, dueño de la cadena local de pizzerías, Champion Pizza, contó que fue al lugar donde encontraron los cuerpo.
“Estaba sorprendido” , dijo Akdeniz. Ha vuelto en varias ocasiones para dejar flores y velar en memoria de los hombres muertos.
Además, deja una pila de pizzas frescas para otros desamparados en el vecindario.
Hakki Akdeniz wept as he left candles, flowers, & pizza at the crimes scenes. He own a pizza shop & feeds the #homeless every wk. He used to be homeless himself & never turns away the hungry. 4 homeless men were savagely beaten to death as they slept in Chinatown. @abc7ny pic.twitter.com/Xi1A84ei4v
— Lucy Yang (@LucyYang7) October 7, 2019
Akdeniz dejó una carta expresando simpatía por la comunidad y tristeza por no haber estado allí para proteger a los hombres que fueron asesinados.
Además de ser conocido por sus habilidades al preparar la pasta para la pizza, a Akdeniz se le reconoce su dedicación para ayudar a la comunidad de personas sin hogar.
“A menudo entrega rebanadas gratis en sus restaurantes y reparte comida y ropa todos los lunes y miércoles”, reportó PIX11. “Hace varios años, comenzó a pagar una tarifa mensual en un gimnasio local para permitir que varias personas al día se duchen, y regularmente lleva a los grupos a una barbería para que le hagan un corte”.
Akdeniz, originario de Turquía, ayuda a la comunidad de personas sin hogar, debido a su propia experiencia de no tener hogar cuando se mudó a los Estados Unidos en 2001.
Llegó a Nueva York con $240 dólares en su bolsillo , durmió en un motel de $30 dólares por noche , pero cuando se le acabó el dinero, dormía en las estaciones de metro.
“Tenía grandes esperanzas, un gran sueño. Tenía un objetivo” , dijo Akdeniz. “Pero a veces la esperanza no es suficiente para alcanzar su objetivo”.
Después de trabajar en pizzerías y ahorrar dinero durante varios años, a finales de 2009, Akdeniz abrió su primera sucursal en el Bajo Manhattan. Las cosas no fueron fáciles y a menudo dormía debajo de su horno para ahorrar dinero.
Ahora tiene siete sursales, cinco en Manhattan, una en Brooklyn y otra en Queens.

Texto completo: Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, the former vice president and a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month, according to a statement from his lawyer.
Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said in a statement Sunday that Biden would resign from the company, BHR, an equity investment fund manager.
The statement added that if Joe Biden were to be elected president, his son would “agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies."
The role of the younger Biden in foreign companies has been a source of political grist for President Trump, who this month publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens' role in companies there.
In the statement, Mesires explained the role of Hunter Biden as an independent board member of Burisma, the largest independent natural gas producer in Ukraine. He earned $50,000 a month on the board of the company.
As vice president, the elder Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who US representatives warned was soft on corruption and whose office oversaw investigations into the gas company's owner. No evidence has surfaced that the vice president, who was carrying out policies of the Obama administration, was motivated by his son's business interests.
Still, Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have used the connection to attack the elder Biden, a political opponent who is running for president as a Democrat.
“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," Trump said in a recent interview with reporters.
Trump has his own troubles related to Ukraine. In July, he urged the Ukrainian president in a phone call to investigate the Bidens. The House has started an impeachment inquiry into that call and whether Trump used his role as president to influence the 2020 election.

Pompeo accuses reporter of working for the DNC
Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville's WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn't waste any time, telling the secretary she was going to "start right away with the tough stuff."
Then, in an exchange that has been described as "gutsy," "relentless," and "a master class in journalism," Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a former US ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.
Undeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that US diplomats believed a relationship between Trump and Ukraine's president was contingent upon the country investigating his political rivals. That's when Pompeo lost his cool.
"You've got your facts wrong," he told Amons, shaking his head. "It sounds like you're working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee."
Pompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Congress that she was ousted as a result of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was "a heck of a day not to be in Washington."
While in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters, including Amons, who has worked for WSMV for more than three decades and produced investigations that have led to federal indictments and state probes. Some speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her.

Louisiana governor forced into runoff with Republican
In a bid to recapture the governor's mansion, Republicans in Louisiana mounted an aggressive challenge to Governor John Bel Edwards, and on Saturday, the party succeeded in forcing the incumbent Democrat into a runoff election against a businessman who has never held political office.
Edwards had hoped to emerge with more than 50 percent of the vote in Saturday's jungle primary, where candidates from across the political spectrum compete against one another. But Edwards, a conservative Democrat, narrowly missed an outright victory.
Instead, Edwards, who took 46 percent of the vote Saturday, will face the businessman, Eddie Rispone, a conservative Republican who has aligned himself with President Trump and who cast himself as an outsider to politics, in a general election Nov. 16. Rispone received 27 percent of the vote.
Edwards has appeared especially vulnerable in a state that Trump won by 20 points in 2016 and where the president made a last-minute push for the Republican challengers at a rally Friday night. The Republican Governors Association had classified Louisiana as a potential “top pick-up."
Still, Edwards, a West Point graduate and the son of a sheriff, has managed to remain palatable among a conservative electorate by underscoring his distance on many issues from the rest of his party. He has pointed to his antiabortion stance and has been vocal in defending his record on protecting gun rights.
During the campaign, he also boasted of his role in closing a $2 billion deficit he inherited from his Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal.
In televised debates and on the campaign trail, Edwards faced off with a pair of Republicans who competed against each other as much as they did the incumbent; Rispone challenged Representative Ralph Abraham, whose congressional district covers sections of the northeastern and central parts of the state.
Abraham received just shy of 24 percent of the vote.
Rispone, who with his brother founded an industrial engineering, construction and maintenance company in Baton Rouge, aligned himself with Trump's policies, particularly on immigration, and attacked Abraham for being, in his view, inconsistent in his support for the president.

How your business can be more like Shake Shack, Nike

Texto completo: Underneath one of the many Shake Shack restaurants in New York City lives the breakaway restaurant chain's Innovation Kitchen. The full-time team isn't filling the orders of hungry guests, but rather is inventing what diners may enjoy for years into the future.
The underground lab focuses all its resources on inventing what's next rather than delivering on today's business needs.
Test kitchens are common among food giants and restaurant chains around the world. They consist of a dedicated team focused on the future. Rather than extracting every ounce of efficiency, they often invest heavily to try completely different concepts, knowing that most will fail. The space is equipped with all the latest gear, ingredients, and supplies in order to foster fresh thinking and drive creativity. It's a place where inventive thinking and imagination are cherished instead of extracted to maximize near-term profits.
While the investment is tiny in proportion to a food company's overall cost structure, these innovation labs play a gigantic role in the organization's ability to drive sustainable success.
Test kitchens provide a steady stream of innovation, allowing team members to dream up tomorrow's solutions without being encumbered by today's imperatives. Without a test kitchen, a food company may be able to deliver on expectations for a while but would suffer greatly over time as inventive competitors leave the laggards behind in their creative wake.
If test kitchens are so vital to sustainable success in the restaurant business, why don't we all embrace the same concept in our own industries?
Your test kitchen could be a small brainstorming room, equipped with art supplies and funky seating to enable your team's creativity. Or it could be a small workshop for tinkering and exploration. In fact, your innovation lab could focus on innovations far beyond products and services; what about a test kitchen for improved processes, driving customer engagement or boosting safety? Your test kitchen can be small, scrappy and resource-constrained while still delivering a big punch of fresh ideas for growth.
Hospitals around the world have installed their own test kitchen concept called Maker Nurse – a dedicated space where front-line health care professionals can safely tinker, explore and improve patient outcomes. Nike has a test kitchen in downtown Chicago called the Nike Lab Recreation Center that invites people from all walks of life to help the shoe company discover new ideas.
Even if you can't dedicate full-time space, at least invest some time and effort to pull the team away from today's deliverables in order to invent tomorrow's solutions. Your test kitchen – whether physical or metaphorical – can yield gigantic leaps forward in growth, efficiency, service and customer success.
Experiment. Tinker. Investigate. Test. Play. Give your team members a chance to let their hair down and explore the limits of their imagination, and you'll invent a delicious path forward.

Organized by the Polis Center, part of the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, Spirit & Place integrates the arts, religion and humanities with a goal of shaping individual and community life.

Hannah-Jones is a former MacArthur Fellow who won a Peabody Award for her 2015 series on school desegregation for public radio series "This American Life."
The Spirit & Place Public Conversation is scheduled 4:30 p.m. Nov. 10 at Shelton Auditorium on Butler University's South Campus, 1000 W. 42nd St.

Texto completo: The Georgia Department of Public Health has announced the state's second death from a vaping-linked illness.
No details on the latest death were provided early Wednesday, as the number of people hospitalized continues to climb. The first person who died in Georgia, announced two weeks ago, was an unidentified man over the age of 35.
The agency did not say where he lived, only that he did not live in metro Atlanta. He had a history of heavy nicotine vaping but no history of vaping THC, which has been linked to a majority of the mysterious vaping-related lung diseases afflicting e-cigarette users.
STATE
Georgia to host November Democratic presidential debate
Georgia will host the Democratic presidential debate on Nov. 20, another indication that the state is a top political battleground in next year's election.
Democratic Party of Georgia chairwoman Nikema Williams told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday she was not clear where the debate will be held, but that it would likely be in metro Atlanta. "All roads to the White House run through Georgia," she said.
State Democratic officials have aggressively lobbied the Democratic National Convention to hold the debate in Georgia, particularly given the double-header U.S. Senate races and competitive U.S. House contests.
ATLANTA
Rec authority, Bottoms adviser rebuke zoo for costly expansion
Simmering tensions between Zoo Atlanta and a government oversight board boiled over this week when a key adviser to Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms criticized the ballooning cost of a major zoo expansion and blasted no-bid contracts and a failure by the zoo to meet requirements to hire minority-owned vendors.
Officials with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority also took aim at the pay of zoo President and CEO Raymond King, whose total compensation more than doubled from 2013 to 2017 to nearly $630,000, putting him among the highest-paid zoo leaders in the nation.
"It's a bigger picture than these loans, it's the overall governance over there and making sure the money, the public money, is being spent the way we're being told it's supposed to be spent," said Alvin Kendall, a consultant to the authority board and adviser to Bottoms.
GWINNETT
Long-struggling Gwinnett Place Mall will soon be up for sale
For a few years now, local business leaders have urged the owners of Gwinnett Place Mall to sell off, move out and give someone else the chance to redevelop the long-struggling shopping center.
It appears they'll soon get their wish. Moonbeam Capital Partners is poised to sell their portion of Gwinnett Place, which is now so empty that it recently attracted Netflix's "Stranger Things" to shoot there -- and, in a more macabre incident, allowed the decomposing body of a murder victim to go unnoticed for weeks.
ATLANTA
Atlanta's rainbow crosswalks are here to stay, mayor says
The federal government has not asked the city of Atlanta to remove the rainbow crosswalks at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, but even if it did, the city wouldn't comply, said a spokesman for Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration, citing safety concerns, has asked cities across the country to remove the rainbow crosswalks -- a prominent municipal symbol of gay pride. The latest, according to the New York Times, is Ames, Iowa.
The news, coupled with the preparations for the 49th Annual Pride Celebration in Piedmont Park this weekend, caused Bottoms's press office to be inundated with questions about whether the city's own rainbow crosswalks were in the federal government's crosshairs.

Melissa Murphy, Gwinnett Online Campus teacher, teaches her students Sept. 25 during Blended Learning Elementary class at Gwinnett Online Campus in Lawrenceville. In a blended classroom, both face-to-face and online instruction take place each day using full digital content developed by teachers.

Along with focusing on reading, writing and arithmetic, more educators in the past few decades have striven to get students to take an active role in their learning. Instead of passively taking in the information such as in lectures or by rote memorization, they want students to engage with the lessons and ultimately perform better. Many think this can only occur face-to-face but education research says online courses can also be effective.
In its 10th year, Gwinnett Online Campus has proved that. With 7,900 courses offered, the program works with schools across the district. It offers choices for students from fourth grade through high school as full-time online learners who work from home, or students who take up to five online classes as part of their regular school day through supplemental programs."The days of teaching just one way are over," said Principal Christopher Ray. "Our method allows teachers to see in real time what students need. If someone if falling behind, there's an opportunity to pull them out for extra instruction right away. Or if a student is excelling, they can work ahead without it affecting the flow of the class."

Texto completo: The current fad of large companies and universities cravenly apologizing for their participation in slavery, no matter how slight the involvement, has become pervasive. Slavery was terrible, and it has thankfully been gone for 154 years, but certain black leaders simply cannot pass up the opportunity to monetize for themselves this ancient history. Certainly, the effects of slavery lasted for many years after the Civil War, but as long as so many black Americans wallow in victimhood, they will not be able to take their rightful place in our economy. It is sad that to gain and maintain political power, most black leaders continue to use the victimhood race card. Black Americans deserve better leaders, but that, sadly, is who they routinely elect.

'Unprotected'series spotlights care issues
Regarding "Suffering Behind the Facade" (News, Sept. 29), as a geriatric social worker in the field for 35 years, I am neither surprised nor shocked at what you are uncovering. My experience in training care staff is that most choose to do the work they do not for the money, but because they hope to provide compassionate care. Yet they are placed in jobs that require them to be superhuman. How can any caring human being be expected to care for 10 to 15 residents when these elders have dementia, need help with most activities of daily living and often resist the care they need? Not only are elders not receiving the best possible care and being placed in harm's way, but care staff cannot provide the best possible care and are also often placed in harm's way. Perhaps your series will wake some people up!

Dem hopefuls should spotlight Trump's flaws
Democratic candidates should always refer to "draft-dodging Trump," acting like a 600-pound man sleeping in the basement of his mom's house, eating fried chicken and tweeting. They should point out that a real "stable genius" would read books, respect different opin-ions and know a free press is part of what makes our government system great and that Fox News is not "fair and balanced." They also should point out that a brilliant, New York-elite billionaire would love to release his taxes to show his ability to make money (maybe Trump is not a billionaire?). "Draft-dodging Trump," please act presidential and realize you are president of all the people, Democrats and Republicans. "Draft-dodging Trump," don't give silly names to those who criticize you, as that is kindergarten stuff.
GEORGE FALKENSTEIN, CANTON
AJC's anti-Trump bias shows on Opinion page
It is atrocious that the AJC is inserting anti-Trump bias into its opinion page. Balanced reporting is reporting points of view from both political ideologies. Your Opinion page of Sunday, Oct. 6, presented two columns -- one from Gail Collins of the New York Times representing the left, and one from Mona Charen of Creators Syndicate purporting to represent the right. The problem here is Ms. Charen is clearly an anti-Trumper. The AJC did not fairly represent opposing points of view and joins the ranks of unethical media in sneaking in anti-Trump ideology in the guise of an opinion "From the Right." Its Editorial Board should be ashamed of itself.

Texto completo: From a guest column on AJC.com by Jack Bernard, a Republican and former chairman of the Jasper County Commission:
Impeachment is the role of the House of Representatives. Removal of an impeached President (after a trial and vote) is the role of the Senate.
The Constitution did not envision our two-party system where the impeachment/removal process would be primarily controlled by party loyalty, extreme partisanship and politics. Thus, putting nation over other factors like party (as the Constitution envisioned) has not always been the case. For example, Clinton lied about a sexual affair having nothing to do with the daily functions of government. Clinton was then impeached by the GOP-controlled House (led by an obviously partisan Newt Gingrich) for lying to Congress, but the Democratic Senate subsequently refused to remove him from office.
On the other hand, true statesmen did (at other times) put the interests of our country before political gain. Famously, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the father of the modern conservative movement, went to Richard Nixon and indicated to him that the GOP Senate would support his removal if he did not resign.
From a New York Times column by Bret Stephens:
I came of age as a conservative in an era when Republicans were keen on matters of private virtue and public probity. Then Bill Clinton became president, and his behavior exemplified neither. In 1998 he was impeached by a partisan GOP House. But he survived the drama -- and could have easily been reelected to a third term absent the 22nd Amendment -- for three reasons. His opponents overreached. The country was doing fine. And his supporters could be remarkably creative or brazen (when they weren't simply mute) in excusing behavior they would never have tolerated from a Republican.
It's hard not to think of that episode now that the shoe is on the other foot. As with liberals and Clinton, so with conservatives and Trump: Their ethics have turned out to be purely situational. As a matter of immediate partisan interest, this is also likely to help the president.
But it won't help the country, or the long-term interests of the party, much as the Democrats' defense of Clinton didn't help them.

Texto completo: Hoy abrió al público una plataforma de observación de vidrio en el piso 102 del Empire State Building que ofrece vistas de 360 ​​grados de la ciudad, en un ambiente sin paredes.
La apertura marca el comienzo de lo que los diseñadores llaman la “Experiencia del Observatorio”, resultado de cuatro años y $165 millones de dólares en renovaciones destinadas a resolver las largas colas y la congestión para hacer más atractiva la visita al edificio más famoso de Nueva York y quizá EEUU.
Después de ingresar, ahora a través de la calle 34 en lugar de la 5ta Avenida, los visitantes pasan por la fascinante arquitectura art deco y un modelo de 24 pies del edificio antes de acceder a una exhibición de 10 mil pies cuadrados sobre la historia del edificio abierto en 1931.
La exhibición dinámica y digital impulsa a los visitantes hacia los ascensores que transportan, en 55 segundos, a la cubierta del piso 86.
Los visitantes pueden ir al piso 102 pagando $20 dólares adicionales. Una variedad de beneficios, como tours privados y pases sin colas también están disponibles en paquetes que cuestan hasta $460, describió el New York Times.
“Es, simplemente, una vista inigualable”, dijo el jueves Jean-Yves Ghazi, presidente de Empire State Realty Trust, la compañía propietaria del edificio.
“Somos el punto en el mapa que mantiene unida a esta ciudad”, agregó. “Hay mucho significado aquí. La altura no es el marcador; se trata del estatus icónico de este lugar”.
El mirador en el piso 102 ofrecerá a grupos de unas 55 personas la oportunidad de ver Nueva York desde el panorama más alto de 360 ​​grados en la ciudad , destacó Ghazi.
El observatorio es completamente transparente. Los que se atreven pueden mirar directamente a las calles de abajo.
“Nunca ha habido un mejor momento para darle una nueva mirada” a la ciudad, escribió James S. Russell, recomendando que hasta los neoyorquinos y turistas que han subido al mirador del Empire State deberían volver ahora a redescubrirlo.

Justice Dept. Presses Court To Halt the Release of Taxes

Texto completo: But the department did not agree with President Trump's lawyers that a sitting president is immune from criminal investigation.
The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court on Friday to stop the release of President Trump's tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney's office, arguing that local prosecutors should have to meet a very high legal bar before investigating a sitting president.
The filing meant Mr. Trump's own Justice Department was lending support to his attempt to block a subpoena demanding eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. The district attorney's office issued the subpoena to Mr. Trump's accounting firm in late August as part of an investigation into hush-money payments made before the 2016 presidential election.
But in its filing, the Justice Department, which is led by Attorney General William P. Barr, stopped short of endorsing Mr. Trump's most sweeping argument: that sitting presidents are totally immune from all criminal investigations.
Mr. Trump's lawyers had made the argument in a lawsuit attempting to shield his tax returns from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
The lawsuit argued that the Constitution prevented a sitting president from being "investigated, indicted or otherwise subjected to criminal process," especially from a local prosecutor, such as Mr. Vance.
On Monday, Judge Victor Marrero of United States District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit and rejected that position, which he called "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."
The Justice Department had not previously weighed in with its view of the merits of Mr. Trump's lawsuit, which made an argument that has not been tested in the courts.
But after Mr. Trump appealed Judge Marrero's ruling, the department wrote to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, saying it wanted to provide its views in a case that raised "a number of significant constitutional issues that potentially implicate the interests of the United States."
Even though the United States is not a party to the lawsuit, it has the right to give its views. In the brief filed on Friday, the department asked the appeals court to reverse Judge Marrero's decision and order him to stop enforcement of the subpoena.
The department reiterated its longstanding position that a sitting president may not be charged or prosecuted, citing Justice Department memos dating to the Nixon and Clinton administrations.
But in essence, the department declined to adopt Mr. Trump's absolutist argument for immunity from criminal investigation, and instead urged the appellate court to have Judge Marrero take a closer look at the burdens a subpoena from a local prosecutor would impose on the president.
Mr. Vance should not be able to obtain the president's personal records "unless and until -- at a minimum -- the District Attorney is able to make the required showing of particularized need," the brief read.
The department said Mr. Vance's office had to show that the records it was seeking from Mr. Trump were central to the grand jury's investigation and were needed immediately, as opposed to after the president leaves office.
The district attorney also should have to show that the records were not available elsewhere, the department wrote.
Presidential materials "should not be treated as just another source of information," the department said. "A subpoena directed at a president's records should be permitted only as a last resort."
Mr. Trump's lawyers, in a separate appeal brief filed on Friday, said "the president's claim of absolute immunity is meritorious."
They argued that the framers of the Constitution had recognized the need for a strong chief executive and created a process for investigating and removing him in a manner that would "embody the will of the people" -- a clear reference to impeachment.
"A lone county prosecutor cannot circumvent this arrangement," Mr. Trump's lawyers said. "That the Constitution empowers thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable."
Mr. Vance's office has been examining whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship.
The current dispute began after Mr. Vance's office subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.
Mr. Trump sued in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking to block the subpoena. His lawyers argued that enforcement of the subpoena was a politically motivated action by Mr. Vance's office and that its enforcement would cause the president irreparable harm.
"Criminal investigations impose severe burdens on the president and distract him from his constitutional duties," the president's lawyers wrote at the time.
Mr. Vance's office, rejecting the president's arguments, claimed that Mr. Trump was trying to "invent and enforce a new presidential 'tax return privilege."'
The district attorney's office declined to comment on Friday. Its response to the briefs filed by the president and the Justice Department is due Tuesday. The appeals court, which typically decides cases with three-judge panels, is to hear oral arguments on the matter on Oct. 23.
Mr. Trump has challenged attempts by Congress to obtain his tax returns. On Friday, a separate federal appeals court panel in Washington ruled that the House Oversight Committee can subpoena Mazars for eight years of the president's financial records.

Texto completo: The Russian cosmonaut's thrilling feat in 1965 nearly cost him his life, but raised Soviet prestige during the Cold War space race against the United States. Aleksei Leonov, the Russian cosmonaut who became the first person to walk in space, a thrilling feat that nearly cost him his life but raised Soviet prestige during the Cold War space race against the United States died on Friday in Moscow. He was 85.
His death was announced by Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, on its website.
The milestone achievement by Mr. Leonov, a major in the Soviet Air Force at the time, showed that men could survive in space outside the confines of their craft and presumably walk on the moon one day.
His spacewalk, in March 1965, was seen by television viewers in the Soviet Union and Europe on videotape. Later in the mission, a live telecast showed Mr. Leonov and a fellow cosmonaut strapped in their seats in the cabin.
The spacewalk enabled the Russians once again to upstage the United States in space; they had launched the first satellite, Sputnik, in October 1957 and the first manned spaceflight into orbit, with Yuri Gagarin, in April 1961.
Edward H. White II of the United States Air Force carried out America's first spacewalk some two and half months later, leaving his two-man Gemini 4 capsule for 20 minutes.
NASA said in a statement that Mr. Leonov's "venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity that makes today's Space Station maintenance possible."
Mr. Leonov would have likely been the first Russian to walk on the moon had the Soviet Union not given up on its lunar ambitions. In 1975, he took part in a pioneering linkup in orbit of Soviet and American spaceships that ultimately led to creation of the International Space Station.
He emerged from his two-man Voskhod 2 for his spacewalk on March 18, 1965, while the spacecraft was orbiting above Earth at some 18,000 miles an hour. He spent about 10 minutes maneuvering, tethered to it with a cord.
"As far as I can remember, I was concentrating fully, cold blooded and relatively unexcited," Mr. Leonov wrote in a first-person account in Life magazine two months later. "The sight was spectacular! The stars do not blink. The sun seems welded into the black velvet of the sky. The earth alone speeds along."
What Mr. Leonov did not reveal until many years later was that he and his fellow cosmonaut, Pavel I. Belyayev, who was also an Air Force pilot, were fortunate to have survived.
Mr. Leonov's specially designed suit had unexpectedly inflated during his walk, and its bulk was preventing him from getting back inside the Voskhod.
"I knew I could not afford to panic, but time was running out," he recalled in the book "Two Sides of the Moon" (2004), written with the astronaut David Scott, about their experiences in space.
Mr. Leonov slowly deflated the suit by releasing oxygen from it, a procedure that threatened to leave him without life support. But with the reduced bulk, he finally made it inside.
"I was drenched with sweat, my heart racing," he remembered.
But that, he added, "was just the start of dire emergencies which almost cost us our lives."
The oxygen pressure in the spacecraft rose to a dangerous level, introducing the prospect that a spark in the electrical system could set off a disastrous explosion or fire.
It returned to a tolerable level, but the cosmonauts never figured out the reason for the surge.
When it came time for the return to Earth, the spacecraft's automatic rocket-firing system did not work, forcing the cosmonauts to conduct imprecise manual maneuvers during the descent that left them in deep snow and freezing temperatures in a remote Russian forest, far from their intended landing point.
It took several hours for a search party to find them and drop supplies from a helicopter, and they spent two nights in the forest, the first one inside their spacecraft and the second one in a small log cabin built by a ground rescue crew, until rescuers arrived on skis. They then took a 12-mile ski trek to a clearing, where a helicopter evacuated them.
Nearly four years after his spacewalk, Mr. Leonov had another brush with death.
In January 1969, a car in which he was riding with three other former cosmonauts -- part of a motorcade that included the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev -- was entering the Kremlin for a celebration marking the docking of two Russian spaceships when a man wielding a pistol in each hand opened fire. The car carrying Mr. Leonov was hit by 14 bullets, which shattered the windows and killed the driver.
"I looked down and saw two bullet holes on each side of my coat where the bullets passed through," Mr. Leonov told The New York Times Magazine in 1994. "A fifth bullet passed so close to my face, I could feel it going by. When it was over, Brezhnev took me inside and told me, 'Those bullets were not meant for you, Aleksei, they were meant for me, and for that, I apologize."'
The gunman had apparently fired on Mr. Leonov's car thinking Brezhnev was inside, but his car had already peeled off from the motorcade. He was quickly captured, declared insane and sentenced to a mental institution.
In July 1975, Mr. Leonov, flying with Valery N. Kubasov, took part in the good-will mission in which his Soyuz 19 spacecraft docked in orbit with an American Apollo spaceship carrying three astronauts. The cosmonauts and the astronauts exchanged gifts and spent nearly 50 hours together, conducting scientific experiments.
Mr. Leonov, an accomplished amateur artist, presented the astronauts -- Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand and Deke Slayton -- with sketches he had drawn of them during joint training.
The cosmonauts were later greeted by President Gerald R. Ford on a visit to the White House and the American spacemen toured the Soviet Union as guests of the cosmonauts.
Aleksei Arkhipovich Leonov was born on May 30, 1934, in the Siberian village of Listvyanka, one of 12 children. His father, Arkhip, a former coal miner who had become a farmer, was sent to a Soviet prison when Aleksei was 3, having been falsely denounced as an enemy of the state, but was released after several years.
When Aleksei was 6, he met a Soviet pilot and became enthralled by aviation. He was admitted to flight-training school, joined the Air Force, flew jet fighters and served as a test pilot. He was among the first group selected for cosmonaut training, in 1960.
He later became director of the cosmonaut corps and retired from the Soviet space program in 1992 as a major general.
Mr. Leonov lived near Moscow, had business interests and spoke around the world on space travel.
Mr. Leonov is survived by his wife, Svetlana, who edited publications issued by Russia's Cosmonaut Training Center; their daughter, Oksana; and two grandchildren. His daughter Viktoria died before him.
In 1969, Mr. Leonov was sitting in front of a television when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first moonwalkers as part of the Apollo 11 flight. Though he knew he would never fulfill his dream of walking on the moon, he saw a larger picture that day.
"Everyone forgot, for a few moments, that we were all citizens of different countries on Earth," he wrote in "Two Sides of the Moon." "That moment really united the human race."

Texto completo: When officials revealed last week that the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower had alleged ties to a 2020 Democratic candidate, two important questions were raised: Who was the candidate? And what was the nature of their relationship? We now can answer the first: The candidate was likely former Vice President Joe Biden.

The connection makes sense when you connect the report to what we already know about the whistleblower: He or she likely had a position in the White House, given the proximity of his allegations. And as the New York Times reported in September, the whistleblower was likely an intelligence officer of some sort, given his familiarity with protocol. He or she might have even been detailed to the National Security Council at some point.

“From everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch, then there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president,” a retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner yesterday.

The nature of this relationship is still up in the air. But given the whistleblower’s knowledge of Ukraine — as demonstrated in the complaint — it’s probable this person accompanied Biden on at least one of his six visits to Ukraine, as the Washington Examiner noted.

A close, past connection to Biden could have been a motivating factor in the whistleblower’s decision to come forward. And though this relationship doesn’t discredit the content of the whistleblower’s complaint, it does reveal that perhaps the whistleblower had a stake in this game after all.

Or perhaps the relationship was innocuous, as Glenn Carle, a former CIA officer who blew the whistle on former President George W. Bush’s administration, told the Washington Examiner.

“The truth is that the whistleblower would have worked with Biden not in some partisan political sense but as a member of the government,” he said.

It could be that the whistleblower’s complaint was purely professional and not personal. But if the House is going to base its entire impeachment inquiry on this complaint, it had better be airtight. A blatant conflict of interest could disrupt the entire process, and Democrats owe it to the American people to make sure the person whose testimony they have relied on is free of bias.

Congress has the right and the responsibility to look into the nature of Biden’s past ties to the whistleblower. As it’s suggested before, the House could hold a closed-door hearing, off-site, and away from the public eye to protect the whistleblower’s anonymity. But it should at least do something to address these concerns before it moves to remove the sitting president. These are serious allegations against both the president and the whistleblower, and they should be treated as such.

But if the Democrats ignore these allegations and move forward anyway, Biden won’t be the only one with some explaining to do.

Texto completo: Washington • Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May, testified to impeachment investigators Friday that a top State Department official told her that President Donald Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though the department believed she had “done nothing wrong.”
In a closed-door deposition that could further fuel calls for Trump’s impeachment, Yovanovitch delivered a scathing indictment of how his administration conducts foreign policy. She warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats’ judgment, threatening to undermine the nation’s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service. And she said that diplomats no longer have confidence that their government “will have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests.”
According to a copy of her opening statement obtained by The New York Times, Yovanovitch said she was “incredulous” that she was removed as ambassador “based, as far as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.”
Yovanovitch, a 33-year veteran of the foreign service and three-time ambassador, spoke to investigators on Capitol Hill even though the State Department had directed her not to late Thursday and in defiance of the White House’s declaration that administration officials would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. Democrats leading the inquiry said that order amounted to obstruction of their inquiry and quietly issued a subpoena Thursday morning with the understanding that Yovanovitch would then cooperate.
Not long after, she arrived at the Capitol with a lawyer and entered the secure basement rooms of the House Intelligence Committee, where she was expected to take questions from congressional staff and lawmakers for much of the day.
Her searing account, delivered at the risk of losing her job, could lend new momentum to the impeachment inquiry that imperils Trump. The inquiry centers on the president’s attempts to use his power and the foreign policy apparatus to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, an endeavor in which Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, was a central player. The shadowy effort by Giuliani grew to drive U.S. policy toward Ukraine, at times appearing to sideline the State Department in the process.
Yovanovitch said in her deposition that the undermining of loyal diplomats at the State Department would embolden “bad actors” who would “see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system” and serve the interests of adversaries of the United States, including Russia.
“Today we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,” she said. She called upon the department’s leaders, as well as Congress, to defend it, saying “I fear that not doing so will harm our nation’s interest, perhaps irreparably.”
And she spoke of her “deep disappointment and dismay” about the events that led to her removal, describing a sense of betrayal of the “sacred trust” she and other diplomats once had with their government.
Yovanovitch dismissed as “fictitious” the allegations that she had been disloyal to Trump, which were circulated by allies of Giuliani.
“I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me,” she said, adding that people associated with him “may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
Yovanovitch’s opening statement revealed no new details about Trump’s effort to pressure President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden. It also offered no details about Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, two businessmen who helped Giuliani mount a campaign for her removal. Both were arrested late Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations.
The indictment charged that they were working for one or more unnamed Ukrainian officials who wanted her out of Kyiv.
But she provided new details about her abrupt ouster just as Ukraine had elected a new president, when continuity in U.S. policy was critical, she argued.
Less than two months after the State Department asked her to extend her tour as ambassador until 2020, she said, she was abruptly told in late April to return to Washington “on the next plane.”
She said that John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, told her later that she had “done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.” Other foreign diplomats said they know of no parallel to her case.
Sullivan told her that Trump had “lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador,” she said. “He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018.”
That account contradicts what the State Department told reporters at the time, that Yovanovitch was merely completing her assignment “as planned.”
Even as she was being questioned behind closed doors Friday, Trump nominated Sullivan to be the next ambassador to Russia. The timing appeared to be coincidental.
Yovanovitch said that she had never inhibited any legitimate efforts by Ukraine to combat corruption; instead, she tried to bolster them to help Ukraine combat Russia’s influence.
She was not involved in discussions about the suspension of $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine this summer; those took place only after she left Ukraine in May, she said.
She said she feared that the administration’s failure to back its diplomats would harm U.S. interests, including Ukraine’s attempts to reform its government and defend against a hostile Russia.
“That harm will come not just through the inevitable and continuing resignation and loss of many of this nation’s most loyal and talented public servants,” she said, according to the prepared remarks.
“It also will come when those diplomats who soldier on and do their best to represent our nation face partners abroad who question whether the ambassador truly speaks for the president and can be counted upon as a reliable partner. The harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,” she said.
Yovanovitch said she had met Giuliani only a few times, and at least in her prepared remarks, offered no details about his efforts to freelance foreign policy in Ukraine and to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Giuliani’s role is now at the center of the House’s impeachment inquiry into whether the president withheld military aid and a White House meeting in an effort to gin up a foreign investigation that would damage the elder Biden, one of Trump’s foremost political rivals.
That Yovanovitch appeared at all was remarkable and raised the possibility that other government officials would follow suit in defiance of the administration’s orders.
Three House committees conducting the investigation hope to tick through a roster of additional witness depositions next week, when lawmakers return to Washington from a two-week recess. Among them are Fiona Hill, who until this summer served as senior director for Europe at the National Security Council and is scheduled to appear Monday; George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state and Ukraine expert, whose appearance is set for next Tuesday; and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, whose scheduled appearance Tuesday was blocked by the State Department hours before he was to arrive on Capitol Hill.
Sondland has now agreed to comply with a House subpoena and testify Thursday, despite the State Department’s instruction that he not appear, although he would not hand over documents unless the department did, his lawyer said Friday.
The White House or State Department could try to block those depositions, but like Yovanovitch and Sondland, witnesses may make their own choices. Democrats leading the inquiry warned the Trump administration that attempts to stonewall their work could itself be impeachable conduct.
“Any efforts by Trump administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the committees will be deemed obstruction of a coequal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the president on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up,” wrote the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees.

Life &amp; Arts -- Architecture Review: A Tipping Point Both Elegant and Disorienting

Texto completo: [The Museum of Modern Art Reopens]
New York -- What do the airport, the municipal hospital, and the Museum of Modern Art have in common? Each is condemned to perpetual growth, to add wing upon wing and never achieve final resolution. We resign ourselves to our rambling airports and hospitals but naturally expect more from a building that was once one of the most innovative and influential museums of the 20th century.
In 1939 MoMA completed its first permanent museum, a diminutive but flawless essay in translucent glass (a material imported from Mussolini's Italy) and flowing space. Edward Durell Stone, one of its co-architects, claimed that it was the first building in New York in the International Style, which was only fair since MoMA itself had coined the term just a few years earlier. Since that modest beginning, the museum has sprawled to take up the lion's share of the block between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and 53rd and 54th streets.
Every subsequent addition deferred to the original building. In three campaigns (1950, 1953 and 1964), Philip Johnson extended it to the east and west, and added a sculpture garden. Cesar Pelli pushed it farther westward in 1984 with a residential tower that provided museum space in its base. Yoshio Taniguchi's mighty expansion of 2001-04 added 35,000 square feet of exhibition space (along with 217,000 square feet of additional space for administrative and other needs, a harbinger of changing priorities).
All of these architects replicated the aesthetic language of their International Style model: fluid spatial continuity within a taut rectilinear frame, grace notes limited to those provided by impeccably laconic detailing, and a categorical avoidance of any structural drama, any visible play of weight and support.
Yet the original MoMA could not be enlarged ad infinitum simply by adding more International Style compartments, any more than a song can be turned into a symphony just by adding more notes. Once a certain threshold is crossed, the original loses its integrity without producing something resolved and coherent in its place. And with the newest $450 million enlargement of MoMA, an approach to planning that was splendidly suited to a building of modest scale now stubbornly refuses to cohere.
Of architects working today, Diller Scofidio + Renfro perhaps comes closest to the visual aesthetics of the International Style. Its addition (in collaboration with Gensler, the international design firm), begun in 2016, gives MoMA more than 40,000 additional square feet of exhibition space. Just to the west of the Taniguchi addition, where Tod Williams and Billie Tsien's startlingly imaginative American Folk Art Museum once stood, they have added two generously scaled double-height performance spaces, visible from the street. Farther west, MoMA spills into the lower stories of an extravagant 1,050-foot-high residential tower by Jean Nouvel, whose dynamic diagonal struts finally give some visual excitement to a block that, lined with MoMA's pageant of charcoal and gray facades, offers a kind of rhapsody in smoke.
Gallery by gallery, DS+R's new spaces are quite successful. Somewhat larger than those in the Taniguchi wing, they are pleasingly proportioned and superbly detailed. The maple floors are attractive, and subtly detailed to distinguish themselves from those in the Taniguchi wing. It was also a clever idea to move the bookstore below ground level, so that pedestrians can look down into it (although its managers have evidently had to scramble to make their wares attractive from above, what they call "aerial marketing").
One new space is uncommonly handsome. Just to the west of the Taniguchi wing, visible from outside, a continuous stair wraps around a suspended blade that looks sharp enough to shave with. Its wood-paneled walls, to dampen the inevitable clatter of heels, are speckled with micro-perforations -- one of the most elegant acoustic measures I have ever seen.
There is no question that DS+R can make elegant contemporary spaces, but to array those spaces in comprehensible fashion is a problem of a different order. It is a rule in architecture, from Stonehenge to the Seagram Building, that strong programs make for strong buildings. The clearer and more specific the client's requirements, the easier it is for the architect to resolve them in a unified, coherent design. But an indecisive program makes for an indecisive building, and the architectural program of the new MoMA, along with the innovative installation that marks its reopening, is riddled with ambivalence and insecurity.
Critics have already praised the reconfigured MoMA for dispensing with its traditional narrative of the heroic rise of modernism -- for abandoning, in the words of one New York Times writer, its "Whiggish movement-by-movement logic" -- even as they have complained about its confusing layout. But these are two sides of the same coin. The great museums of the past, a category that sadly now includes the original MoMA, were planned so that the visitor's linear movement was in physical and metaphysical harmony with the story they told. The architectural order reinforced the intellectual order. Controlled vistas were employed so that crucial works could be seen from a distance, and brought into meaningful and often complex relationships with other objects.
It is extraordinary how studiously the new MoMA avoids the axis; gallery doors are purposefully not aligned so there is no sense of enfilade, the axial progression from room to room that culminates in a climax. But a climax presupposes that most unfashionable of things, a hierarchy, without which the visitor is left to wander through an installation that has no point around which one can orient oneself, no sense of rising action and falling action, either in its sequence of objects or sequences of spaces. The result is a museum that is maddeningly disorienting. The intense effort that has been put into signage is itself a warning sign; a well-ordered building should be self-explanatory.
At one time the Museum of Modern Art prided itself on presenting one of the great events in history, a presentation rooted in rigorous value judgments, confidently made. It treated this story with pride, reverence and curiosity. Now it looks at it in vague embarrassment, an embarrassment that permeates its glistening but distressingly insecure shell. It proudly refuses to make value judgments, an attitude nowhere more perfectly expressed architecturally than in its wish "to encourage a multitude of possible routes through the museum." But that in itself is the greatest value judgment of all.

Texto completo: The 10 Cobb County Superior Court judges and the Cobb District Attorney will receive a 4% raise retroactive to Oct. 6.
By a split vote of 3-2, the Cobb Board of Commissioners authorized Oct. 8 this increase to begin Oct. 6 when a 4% merit increase also became effective for all Cobb County employees.
Opposed were Commissioners Bob Ott and Keli Gambrill with Commission Chairman Mike Boyce and Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Lisa Cupid in favor.
Since the Superior Court judges and the DA are state employees, Ott said, "The state needs to take responsibility for the Superior Court judges. At some point in time, we've got to tell the state enough."
Boyce said he would bring this matter to the Cobb delegation of state lawmakers when they meet in December.
However, Boyce said, "We have the best judges in the state. I don't believe we should hold their salary back. It's the first merit raise in four or five years."
Cobb Superior Court Administrator Tom Charron noted that the DA and the Superior Court judges have received one salary raise from the state in 16 years and no raise this year from the state -- other than a supplement from Cobb County.
The Cobb commissioners have the authority to enact the 4% for all Superior Court Judges without seeking legislative action as provided under 2014 Georgia Laws Act 450 (House Bill 1126), Charron added.

Texto completo: The two winners of the Nobel Prize for literature, announced Thursday, are both European literary stylists known for their imaginative prose and also for at times becoming lightning rods for controversy.
But that's where the similarity ends between Austrian avant-garde novelist, poet, playwright, screenwriter and essayist Peter Handke, who received the 2019 Nobel, and Polish author and political activist Olga Tokarczuk, who belatedly received the 2018 prize. The latter award had been postponed a year after a sexual abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy, which chooses the winner.
The judges hailed Handke for producing an influential body of work "that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience." The prize announcement compared him to another influential 20th-century writer in the German language, Franz Kafka.

Winning the Nobel is "a sensation of freedom I've never felt before," Handke, 76, said in an interview released on YouTube by the Nobel website. It was a turnabout from his 2014 interview with the Austrian newspaper Die Presse, in which Handke called for the Nobel Prize for literature to be abolished and derided the award for what he called its "false canonization" of literature.
Nobel judges lauded Tokarczuk for writing with "a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life." The English version of her novel "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead," translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones , made the longlist for this year's Booker Prize. The unconventional crime novel tells the story of an elderly astrologist who lives in a remote Polish village; her revulsion at hunting initially leads her to believe that dead bodies found in her village are acts of retaliation by animals.
National Public Radio reviewer Kamil Ahsan praised the Polish novelist as "fundamentally a portraitist, a writer with a keen sense for sniffing out the incongruities that make a person."
In an interview Thursday, Tokarczuk, 57, noted that Central Europe is struggling with political turmoil and said she hoped "such a prize will, in a way, give us a kind of optimism." Her books are increasingly being republished in other languages. "That's why translators are so important," she said in the interview published on the Nobel website. "They are like fragile links between languages, reminding us that literature is one."
Last year's Nobel Prize for literature award was scrapped on the heels of the furor surrounding Jean-Claude Arnault, a convicted rapist married to poet and former Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson. The Nobel Foundation announced in March that it planned to double up on the literary awards after last year's controversy, which cut the number of Swedish Academy voters from 18 to 11.
Arnault was accused of leaking the names of Nobel Prize winners as well as assaulting or harassing 18 women -- including Crown Princess Victoria, heir to the Swedish throne -- causing several members to resign. Frostenson and Arnault also faced conflict-of-interest allegations involving Forum, a Swedish cultural center funded in part by the Swedish Academy.
On Thursday the organization took an unusual move to award literature prizes to not one but two authors.
The 2019 winner, Handke was born in the village of Griffen in southern Austria in 1942, the son of a German soldier -- whom he wouldn't meet until his own adulthood -- and a mother who was an ethnic Slovenian. After studying to be a lawyer, he dropped out after publishing "Die Hornissen" ("The Hornets"), an experimental novel-within-a-novel, in 1966.
That same year, he gained notoriety with a provocative play, "Publikumsbeschimpfung" ("Offending the Audience"), in which a quartet of actors debated the nature of drama in between insulting theatergoers. One of his subsequent plays, 1968's "Kaspar," reinterpreted the story of Kaspar Hauser, the 19th-century German boy who claimed to have been held in isolation for years, and portrayed him as a victim of society's attempts to impose its values upon an innocent.
Handke went on to become such a prolific writer that the announcement of his Nobel win cited nearly 100 works. Of those, one of Handke's best-known books is 1970's "Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter" ("The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"), a Kafkaesque crime novel about a former soccer player who becomes a murderer. It was made into a film by German director Wim Wenders, with whom Handke collaborated on the screenplay. Handke also helped write the screenplay for Wenders' most famous film, 1988's "Wings of Desire."
Handke's 1975 book "A Sorrow Beyond Dreams," an account of his mother's life and death, was praised by a Times reviewer as "an exacting picture of the shock and grief that await those who have inherited the ruins of a suicide."
Handke also has received criticism for his political views. After he published "A Journey to the Rivers," a 1995 book that presented a sympathetic view of the Serbian side during the war in Bosnia, reviewer David Rieff called Handke's book "contemptible." In 2006, after Handke attended the funeral of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic -- who died while being tried for war crimes -- German politicians threatened to revoke a literary prize Handke had been awarded, leading him to turn it down, according to the German newspaper Deutsche Welle. "I am a writer and not a judge," Handke said of Milosevic in a 2006 New York Times interview.
The 2018 winner Tokarczuk was born in 1962 in Sulechow in Poland, the offspring of two teachers. She studied psychology at the University of Warsaw before publishing her 1993 debut novel, "Podroz ludzi Księgi" ("The Journey of the Book-People"), which was set in 17th-century France and Spain. She rose to literary stardom with 1996's "Prawiek i inne czasy" ("Primeval and Other Times"), which retold the history of the Polish nation in the 20th century, starting on the eve of World War I.
Other books by Tokarczuk include the historical novel "Księgi Jakubowe" ("The Books of Jacob"), based upon the life of charismatic 18th-century sect leader Jacob Frank. In 2018, Tokarczuk became the first Polish writer ever to win the Booker Prize for her book "Flights," a novel that contemplates both modern travel and the human anatomy.
But Tokarczuk also has become a lightning rod because of her opposition to Poland's conservative ruling Law and Justice Party and her support for gay rights, according to the Associated Press.
A 2018 profile of Tokarczuk in the British newspaper the Guardian depicted her as a controversial figure in her native Poland, where some denounced her after she gave a television interview in which she questioned Poland's self-image as a survivor of oppression, saying that the country had committed "horrendous acts" of colonization during its history. Her publisher had to hire bodyguards to protect her as a result, the Guardian reported. Conversely, she's become a hero to youthful leftists in her country, as the New Yorker reported in a recent profile.
Tokarczuk told the New Yorker she sees herself as a "psychotherapist of the past," who compels her readers to contemplate portions of their own lives and Polish history that they otherwise wouldn't think about.

Texto completo: A memory card found on the ground in Alaska led to a man being arrested for a gruesome murder committed days before the lost storage device was discovered.
Police said a woman in Anchorage discovered the SD card lying on the ground somewhere in Anchorage and turned it over to authorities. When the contents of the card were pulled up on a computer, police found it contained 39 images and 12 videos of 48-year-old Brian Steven Smith brutally strangling and killing a woman, according to the New York Times.
Smith, who is South African, was identified because police said they recognized him from an unspecified prior investigation. The charging document said that the man in the video “had some sort of an English-sounding accent when he spoke.”
The videos allegedly show Smith strangling the woman with his hands and stomping on her neck, at one point he began laughing. While strangling her, police say he can be heard saying, “Just … die.”
On Oct. 2, two days after the memory card was recovered, the body of the woman in the videos was found along a highway. Police said the location of the remains was about 18 miles from the hotel where they think the murder took place.
Smith had checked out a room at the hotel from Sept. 2 to Sept. 4. Police said the carpet in the video matches the carpet seen in the hotel room where the woman was murdered. Furthermore, authorities said that on around 1 a.m. on Sept. 6, Smith’s phone pinged near to where the body was dumped.
Smith made a brief court appearance Wednesday where he pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. He is being held on $500,000 bail.
Police spokesman MJ Thim credited discovery of the memory card as key to nabbing Smith.
“We believe that we have our suspect in custody,” Thim said, “and we are moving forward with determining the rest of the answers to this investigation.”

Trump calls Turkey’s Syrian offensive a ‘bad idea’

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump on Wednesday called a Turkish military operation along the border with Syria “a bad idea” but reiterated his opposition to “endless, senseless wars,” striking a far milder tone than outraged members of Congress, foreign allies and officials in his own administration, who said the incursion must be stopped.
And later in the day, after issuing that statement, Trump seemed dismissive of the plight of the Syrian Kurdish fighters who are in Turkey’s cross hairs.
Speaking to reporters, the president said that while the stateless Kurds had fought alongside American troops against the Islamic State, or ISIS, they had done so out of self-interest, “for their land,” and noted that “they didn’t help us in the Second World War. They didn’t help us in Normandy.”
“With all that being said, we like the Kurds,” he added.
In his earlier statement, Trump said he was holding Turkey responsible for preventing the release of Islamic State fighters who were being held captive in the area and for ensuring “that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape or form.”
Even so, Trump limited his criticism of Turkey, making no mention of taking punitive action, while Republicans on Capitol Hill were sharply critical of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for following through with a plan he disclosed to Trump in a phone call on Sunday. And Pentagon officials privately expressed their anger over Trump’s sudden and unplanned shift in what had been U.S. policy for years to oppose Turkey’s longtime desire to seize territory across its border with Syria.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump’s who often golfs with the president, said in an interview that he had reached an agreement with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to offer “severe” sanctions legislation against Turkey, which Graham predicted would have “widespread bipartisan support.”
“What you’ll be seeing in the coming days is Congress filling in the vacuum,” Graham said, likening Trump’s posture to President Barack Obama’s deep-seated aversion to engagement in Syria. “Obama basically took a pass on Syria and the rest is history. We can’t afford to make that same mistake twice.”
In a joint statement, Graham and Van Hollen said their bill would punish senior Turkish government officials and ban U.S. military transactions with Turkey. The measure would also impose sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of a sophisticated Russian-made missile defense system. Trump has avoided enforcing those sanctions, which members of Congress insist are mandatory under a 2017 law meant to penalize countries for doing business with Russia’s military.
“This invasion will ensure the resurgence of ISIS in Syria, embolden America’s enemies including al-Qaida, Iran and Russia, and launch yet another endless conflict in what had been, until today, one of the most safe and stable areas of Syria and a region experimenting with the best model of local governance currently available in that war-torn country,” the senators said in their statement.
Trump’s step-back posture toward the Turkish incursion is also alienating some of the evangelical leaders who are his core supporters but who fear that Christian minorities in northeastern Syria — some of whom have been under protection from the Kurds — would face danger from attack by Muslim-majority Turkey.
The evangelical leader Franklin Graham appealed to his followers on Twitter to pray that Trump might “reconsider his decision,” adding: “The Turks have a dismal record on human rights & they can’t be trusted. Pray for the Kurds, Christians, & other minorities in this region.”
But Trump was not without his defenders in Congress. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who often speaks with the president and has repeatedly pushed him to avoid foreign conflicts, wrote on Twitter that Trump “is stopping the endless wars and we will be stronger as a result. The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.”
But prominent Democrats also denounced the Turkish move, and criticized Trump for failing to coordinate his decision to pull back American troops from the area — in effect clearing the way for Turkey to attack — with U.S. generals and allies.
At the Pentagon, where more than five years of fighting alongside Kurdish troops in Iraq and Syria has now given way to standing aside as those same allies are attacked, some officials said there was more anger than they had seen at any point in Trump’s presidency.
As recently as last week, Defense Department officials had been assured by Turkish military officials that they were not seeking to launch an invasion of Syria. Nor were officials expecting Trump, in his Sunday call with Erdogan, to open the door for a Turkish offensive by deciding to remove the 50 to 100 U.S. troops in the northeastern portion of Syria, where Erdogan wants to create a “safe zone.”
A person briefed about the call said the discussion between Trump and Erdogan was wide-ranging, until Erdogan, in the second half of the call, complained that the United States was not fully complying with an agreement struck with Turkey in September to jointly create such a safe zone. Erdogan said he intended to unilaterally establish one immediately.
Trump demurred, evidently believing that Erdogan would not be willing to risk the president’s ire. But Erdogan effectively “called the president’s bluff,” the person said. What followed was a scramble to move U.S. personnel from harm’s way in northern Syria.
In the days since, Trump has made repeated references to his desire to withdraw from Syria and avoid the “stupid endless wars” against which he campaigned in 2016. But that has furthered the impression — both in the United States but, perhaps more important, in Turkey — that Trump had blessed Erdogan’s proposed incursion.
Erdogan sees Syria’s Kurdish fighters as an enemy, and wants to flush them out of a safe zone along his country’s southern border with Syria, which has been devastated by a civil war of more than eight years. The conflict has produced an exodus of roughly 1 million Syrian refugees into Turkey whom Ankara wants to relocate into a secured zone across the border.
On Monday, Trump warned that if Turkey did anything that he considered “off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.” But he has not clearly defined those limits.
That supports the view of analysts who say the real red line for Trump and many members of Congress is not a matter of territory but rather the killing of Kurdish fighters.
Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he believed that Erdogan would calibrate any offensive to limit casualties that would prompt a major response from Congress and potentially humiliate Trump.
“I would say this is a war that is not a war,” Cagaptay said. “We’re not going to see fighting of epic proportions. It’s coordinated and pre-orchestrated.”
In his remarks to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Trump said that he was watching to see how Erdogan’s offensive unfolds.
“We’ll see how he does it,” Trump said. “He could do it in a soft manner; he could do it in a very tough manner. And if he does it unfairly, he’s going to pay a very big economic price.”
But national security officials are especially worried about how a Turkish offensive could affect the continuing fight against the Islamic State group, which — thanks in large measure to the Kurdish-led forces now under attack — has lost its territorial holdings in Syria but which officials say has been gaining new momentum in both Syria and Iraq.
“We know that terrorism in Syria does not stay in Syria,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, D-N.H. in a statement. “President Erdogan, despite his claims, does not have the support of the international community for this operation and he refuses to assure the U.S. that he will guard ISIS detention facilities in the area and prevent ISIS from once again gaining a foothold in the region. I’m afraid we are dangerously close to the point of no return.”

Lauer Denies Farrow Book's Allegation

Texto completo: Former NBC anchor Matt Lauer denied that he had a nonconsensual sexual encounter with a network staffer, following reports that a book by journalist Ronan Farrow contains that allegation.
"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault," Mr. Lauer said Wednesday. "It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense."
In Mr. Farrow's book, "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, a former NBC News employee, Brooke Nevils, alleged that Mr. Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The book is due to be released next week.
Mr. Lauer, a longtime co-anchor of NBC's "Today" show, was fired in November 2017 for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. NBC said at the time that it had received a detailed complaint from an employee about misconduct by Mr. Lauer that represented "a clear violation of our company's standards." The book reveals that employee to be Ms. Nevils.
In a statement Wednesday, NBC said: "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint."
Ms. Nevils tweeted Wednesday evening, "I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful."
Mr. Farrow was working for NBC when he started investigating allegations of sexual harassment by movie producer Harvey Weinstein. In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that executives at NBC News slow-walked his investigation.
Mr. Farrow ultimately took the story to the New Yorker where it was published in the fall of 2017. It was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, which Mr. Farrow shared with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.
Mr. Weinstein is due to go to trial in January on criminal charges including rape. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. A spokesman for Mr. Weinstein didn't respond to a request for comment.
In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that Mr. Weinstein tried to pressure NBC News to kill his story. Mr. Farrow wrote that at one point Mr. Weinstein threatened the network, alleging that he was "aware of Mr. Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it." He also wrote that employees at National Enquirer parent American Media LLC were looking into Mr. Lauer's workplace behavior and calling employees at NBC News about it.
"The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate," an American Media spokesman said. NBC said that NBC News "was never contacted by [American Media], or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter."

Texto completo: Former NBC anchor Matt Lauer, who was fired from his job at the network in 2017 after a colleague accused him of misconduct, has denied that he had nonconsensual sex with his accuser, whose allegation is in a coming book by journalist Ronan Farrow.
"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault," Mr. Lauer said in a statement Wednesday. "It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense."
In Mr. Farrow's book, "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, a former NBC News employee, Brooke Nevils, alleged that Mr. Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The book is due to be released next week.
Mr. Lauer, a longtime co-anchor of NBC's "Today" show, was fired in November 2017 for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. NBC said at the time that it had received a detailed complaint from an employee about misconduct by Mr. Lauer that represented "a clear violation of our company's standards." The book reveals that the employee was Ms. Nevils.
In a statement Wednesday, NBC said: "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint."
Ms. Nevils tweeted Wednesday evening, "I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful."
The allegations in Mr. Farrow's book were reported earlier Wednesday by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.
Mr. Farrow was working for NBC when he started investigating allegations of sexual harassment by movie producer Harvey Weinstein. In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that executives at NBC News slow-walked his investigation.
Mr. Farrow ultimately took the story to the New Yorker where it was published in the fall of 2017. It was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, which Mr. Farrow shared with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.
Mr. Weinstein is due to go to trial in January on criminal charges including rape. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein said.
In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that Mr. Weinstein tried to pressure NBC News to kill his story. Mr. Farrow wrote that at one point Mr. Weinstein threatened the network, alleging that he was "aware of Mr. Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it." He also wrote that employees at National Enquirer parent American Media LLC were looking into Mr. Lauer's workplace behavior and calling employees at NBC News about it.
"The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate," an American Media spokesman said.
NBC said that NBC News "was never contacted by [American Media], or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter. And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity."

China is winning the battle for corporate America's soul

Texto completo: It turns out Twitter may be good for something after all.
On Friday, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for the pro-Democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who have been demonstrating against their communist overlords for months. “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” the image he posted read.
With his bland tweet of solidarity, Morey exposed the cravenness of corporate America and revealed the self-proclaimed “wokest professional sports league” in America as a total sham.
Within hours of his tweet, the proverbial roof had caved in on Morey. China’s consulate in Houston expressed its “strong dissatisfaction.” The Houston Rockets offered a swift apology, distancing itself from its own general manager. The NBA did the same, calling the tweet “deeply offensive” and “regrettable.” Morey also retreated, deleting the original tweet and then tweeting a groveling apology.
Of course, the NBA didn’t see reason to apologize when Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai took to Facebook to disagree with Morey. Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, called the Hong Kong protesters a “separatist movement” and their cause a “third-rail issue.”
The irony is that the NBA is seen as the most permissive professional sports league in America in terms of the amount of room it gives players to exercise free speech. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he’s proud the NBA is known as “the wokest professional sports league” out there.
“Political speech is their absolute right within the league,” Silver told the New York Times last year. Try telling that to Morey.
Silver eventually reassured basketball fans that the NBA still believes in free speech. “The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues,” he said. “We simply could not operate that way.”
Well, the Chinese communist government does operate that way and it announced that it will not televise the NBA's preseason games in China.
This is just the latest example of a U.S. corporation bowing to communist China.
American, Delta, and United Airlines gave in to China last year by deleting references to Taiwan as its own country. The Gap apologized for selling t-shirts with a map of China that didn’t include Taiwan or Tibet. Marriott International issued a cowed statement when China’s government shut down its website after the hotel company listed Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet as separate countries.
“We don’t support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,” Marriott said in a statement that could have been written by the Chinese Ministry of State Security Propaganda.
This is all about money, at least for the money-grubbing American corporations. China has a consumer base worth billions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of people there have entered the middle class over the last couple of decades, and they want to spend money on things like NBA merchandise and game tickets.
Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings reports that nearly 500 million people in China watched the NBA last year. That’s an audience roughly 50% larger than the entire U.S. population. The NBA recently announced a five-year contract with Tencent to stream games in China worth a reported $1.5 billion.
The communist Chinese government already has a vice grip on its 1.3 billion subjects. Through the sheer force of its market power, now it is telling Americans what they can and cannot say.
As I’ve written here before, ever since Congress extended permanent normal trade relations to China nearly 20 years ago, pro-China pundits have argued that increased trade and engagement with Beijing would cause the communist regime to open up and embrace democratic values.
But China’s behavior hasn’t changed at all. To the contrary, Beijing has become more authoritarian and more adversarial. Doing business with China has changed us more than it’s changed them.
This episode shows once again that when push comes to shove, the NBA and many other American corporations will prioritize profits over principle, and billions of dollars over millions of lives.
What the NBA and other companies will eventually come to realize is that if and when tanks roll into Hong Kong, China will not be satisfied unless the NBA and American companies applaud while the slaughter is taking place.
At the end of the day, this is not about Chinese communists. It's about us. The world has always had bad actors. The difference is how we respond. We want their money and they want our souls. Sadly, there are plenty of people willing to make that bargain.

Former NBC colleague of Matt Lauer accuses him of rape in new Ronan Farrow book

Texto completo: The NBC News employee whose sexual harassment complaint led to the firing of Matt Lauer in November 2017 says she was raped by the former anchor, according to a new book by investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.
According to a report in Variety, which obtained a copy of the book, “Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,” Lauer allegedly forced the woman, Brooke Nevils, to have anal sex in a hotel room in Sochi, Russia, while the “Today” team was covering the 2014 Winter Olympics.
Nevils, who was interviewed by Farrow and agreed to reveal her identity, worked as an assistant to Meredith Vieira, Lauer’s co-anchor at the time.
Nevils told Farrow she was drinking heavily the night of the incident. She had gone to Lauer’s room twice — once to retrieve an Olympics press credential that he had taken as a joke and a second time at his invitation.
Farrow wrote that “she had no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.”
Nevils alleged that once she was in Lauer’s hotel room, he pushed her against a door and kissed her before pushing her onto the bed and asking her if she liked anal sex. She declined several times, but he “just did it,” according to the book. She said she wept into a pillow during the incident.
“It was non-consensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,” Nevils said in the book. “It was non-consensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn’t want to have anal sex.”
Nevils told Farrow she had more sexual encounters with Lauer after the incident. She said she was fearful that he had control over her career. Farrow wrote that sources close to Lauer said Nevils sometimes initiated their meetings.
Nevils told Vieira about the Sochi incident in 2017. Vieira told her to report it to NBC’s human resources department with a lawyer. Lauer was terminated the day after Nevils and her attorney met with NBC.
In a report Wednesday on “Today,” the network said in a statement: “Matt Lauer’s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible as we said at the time. That’s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break for our colleague.”
Lauer’s attorney provided an open letter from his client to Variety, calling allegations that the encounter was an assault “categorically false.” Lauer again said it was consensual.
“It’s outrageous,” Lauer said in the letter. “So after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support that I say ‘enough.’ ”
Lauer has previously denied that any of the sexual relationships he had with women who worked with him were non-consensual.
Nevils’ allegations in the book stunned Lauer’s former “Today” colleagues, who reported on them on Wednesday’s program.
“This is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don’t even know what to say about it,” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie said. “I think I speak for all of us when I say we’re disturbed to our core.”
Co-anchor Hoda Kotb, who was close friends with Lauer, also expressed dismay. “You feel like you’ve known someone inside and all of a sudden a door opens up and it’s a part of them you didn’t know,” she said.
The book, which was given in advance to the Hollywood Reporter for a cover story out Wednesday, also details what Farrow says were Harvey Weinstein’s efforts to use information the movie mogul had about Lauer’s behavior as leverage, in an effort to suppress Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct.
An NBC News representative was not available for comment. But executives have denied the allegation, which has circulated as a rumor since Lauer was fired.
Farrow shared a Pulitzer Prize with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey for his reporting on alleged sexual harassment, assault, rape and abuse of power by Weinstein during his long career. Farrow started his investigation at NBC News but left in frustration as executives believed he did not have enough corroboration to get the story on the air. Farrow eventually had the story published in the New Yorker on Oct 10, 2017.
NBC News executives have maintained that they supported Farrow’s reporting on the Weinstein scandal but would not budge from their position that he needed a victim or witness to the mogul’s alleged behavior to be identified on camera for the story to air.
NBC News executives have said Farrow’s reporting done at the network never reached the necessary standard for putting it on the air. They said none of the seven victims whom Farrow named in his meticulously reported New Yorker piece — Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth and Sophie Dix — were willing to speak on the record or be identified on camera to discuss the allegations.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Presidential candidate and Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that it's "nonsense" to think his campaign was trying to hide the fact he had a heart attack last week.
During his first sit-down interview since leaving a Nevada hospital Friday, Sanders swatted back claims that his campaign was concealing the medical issue.
"That's nonsense," he told NBC News. "I don't know what people think campaigns are, you know we're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on really. "
Sanders said he believes his campaign "acted absolutely appropriately. "
"The first thing that we're trying to do is understand what's going on and not run to the New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes," he said. "You know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately. "
Sanders' campaign last Wednesday announced that doctors found the Vermont Senator had blockage in one artery and two stents were inserted after he felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas.
More: Bernie Sanders will not participate in LGBTQ town hall after heart attack
It wasn't until Friday that Sanders' campaign officially noted he'd had a heart attack. Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arun Guraraj, Sanders' treating physicians, said in a statement that the senator was “diagnosed with a myocardial infarction” at another facility before being transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. A myocardial infarction is the medical term for a heart attack.
Sanders at 78 years old is the oldest person running for president in 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and President Donald Trump is 73. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 71.
More: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.
More: Sanders says heart attack won't hurt campaign
According to NBC News, Sanders also said he "misspoke" when he said Tuesday that he would "change the nature" of his campaign post-heart attack.
"I misspoke the other day, I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it," Sanders said. "We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings. ”

'It's Always Sunny' has dodged cancel culture

Texto completo: Fans of the deeply irreverent "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" probably never expected to hear the show mentioned in the same breath as the 1950s values-ridden family sitcom "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" -- unless it was to contrast the two. Charlie Day, one of the co-creators of "It's Always Sunny," certainly didn't.
But the two now share a unique distinction.
With the recent premiere of the FX show's 14th season, they share the record for being the longest running live-action sitcom, a fact Day dubbed a "dinner conversation statistic of pride" during an interview with the Washington Post.
The show's origin story has become something of Hollywood lore. Frustrated with their struggles to break into the acting world, a group of out-of-work actors decided to shoot their own material. Rob McElhenney, one of the stars and co-creators, started with a darkly comic scenario that he originally envisioned as a short film about a guy who "came over to another friend's house to get sugar, and the friend tells him he has cancer, and all the guy can think about is getting his sugar and getting out of there," he told The New York Times in 2007.
With no budget to speak of, they used their own equipment and shot in their own apartments until -- next thing you know -- FX picked up the show, about a cranky group of friends running an Irish bar in south Philly, and added Kaitlin Olson to the cast along with McElhenney, Day and their co-creator Glenn Howerton.
Critics and a certain cult following loved the first season, but it wasn't picking up the steam it required. FX execs suggested that adding a bigger star to the cast of unknowns might gin up some more attention for the show -- and made it clear this wasn't a choice, the co-creators have said. It turned out Danny DeVito, a 30-year veteran of the big screen and an Emmy winner for "Taxi," had become a fan of the show. He joined the second season and has been with the show since.
From the jump, the show was built around these narcissistic crew of sociopaths -- calling them friends doesn't feel right, since friends generally don't try to constantly con one another -- and it's never really lightened its tone.
But while its quips about serial killing, child molestation, abortion and you-name-it might explain why it's never been nominated for a major Emmy, it did earn a steady audience.
"We don't have a lot of hardware accolades to brag about," Day said. "So I guess we can brag about statistics.
"I honestly don't have a clue why it's lasted this long," he added. "We've always been a bit of a counterculture show. We started out as the anti-sitcom. There's going to be nothing warm and fuzzy about this show, and we're gonna go right for the jugular. ... I think there's always going to be an audience for that kind of a show."
The business of actually making the show hasn't changed much in that time. The writing process, for example, remains "pretty much the same at the end of the day. It's usually Rob and I in a room, or (writers) David Hornsby and Megan Ganz in a room, and we just keep banging our heads against a wall until we have something that works."
Perhaps the show's most impressive feat is how it hasn't fallen prey to #cancelculture.
"I think the reason we came out unscathed is we're sort of grandfathered into some bad behavior," Day said. "If we, all of a sudden, launched the show this season and we're saying and doing the things we do, people might be a little more skittish about it."

Texto completo: The federal government has not asked the city of Atlanta to remove the rainbow crosswalks at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, but even if it did, the city wouldn'tcomply, saidaspokesman for Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration, citing safety concerns, has asked cities across the country to remove the rainbow crosswalks--a prominent municipal symbol of gay pride.
The latest, according to the New York Times, is Ames, Iowa.
The news, coupled with the preparations for the 49th Annual Pride Celebration in Piedmont Park this weekend, caused Bottoms's press office to be inundated with questions about whether the city's own rainbow crosswalks were in the federal government's crosshairs.
"While we have received no such request, Atlanta's rainbow crosswalk is located on city-owned streets," said Bottoms Spokesman Michael Smith. "Much like glitter, the crosswalk is here to stay indefinitely. The Bottoms Administration wishes Atlanta a safe and fabulous Pride."
The city of Ames has thus far
rebuffedthe government's request and in the process, made national headlinesabouthowthesmall Midwestern town is taking on the administration of U. S. President Donald Trump. The city is home to roughly 66,000 people, about half of whom are students.
In the Federal Highway Administration's Sept. 5 letter to Ames city leaders, the government cites no safety statistics or studies indicating that colorful crosswalks pose a greater threat to pedestrians than the typical plain white stripes.
"The purpose of aesthetic treatments and crosswalk art is to 'draw the eye' of pedestrians and drivers, in direct conflict with commanding the attention of drivers and motorists to minimize the risk of collision," the letter said.
The government's failure to identify any reports showing the rainbow crosswalks received more injuries bothered Jamie Ensely, president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that works within the Republican Party to advocate for gay and lesbian rights and has already endorsed Trump in the 2020 election.
"I would like to see statistics or a study from the federal highway administration, that states people are being injured and that car accidents have been caused from rainbow crosswalks," Ensely said.
In Atlanta, the crosswalk at 10th and Piedmont at the southwest corner of Piedmont Park still resonates emotionally with many in Atlanta's LGBT community, according to Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality. Temporarily painted in 2015 for Atlanta Pride week and then permanently instated in 2017, Atlanta was among the earliest cities to install a rainbow crosswalk.
The intersection was once home to Outwrite Bookstore &Coffee House, an important gathering spot for the city's LGBT community. Graham said the community often went there in anticipation of important court decisions or to protest.
"I'm certainly pleased with the mayor's response," Graham said.

'Starters' set for new podcast at the Athletic

Texto completo: "The Starters" have found a new home in time for the NBA season. The popular quartet has joined the Athletic and will launch a new daily podcast next week. Tas Melas, Leigh Ellis, Trey Kerby and Phil Elder (professionally known as J.E. Skeets) were free agents after Turner did not renew their contract earlier this year following six years of hosting an irreverent show on NBA TV.
The podcast, titled "No Dunks," will be available outside the Athletic's paywall and feature the daily musings of the four hosts in their trademark quirky style. Before their run on TV, "The Starters" were among the first personalities to create a podcast and eventually joined Grantland's network before creating the TV show.
"It's definitely going to be what people know when it comes to our NBA coverage," Elder said in an interview. "We're getting back to our roots in podcasting and we're going to be talking every day about games, big stories and really the hilarity of the NBA."
The show will feature a healthy dose of the irreverence "The Starters" are known for - during NBA Summer League two years ago, the four hosts dressed as Las Vegas showgirls - as well as give the Athletic, a subscription sports website specializing in local team-by-team coverage, another platform to showcase the work of its stable of writers.
In addition to quirky humor, the hosts have plans to interview Athletic writers about their biggest NBA stories. "The idea is to draw from our newsroom and highlight the news from the Athletic that's driven by people on the front lines with these teams," said Nick Adler, the Athletic's general manager of audio.
"The Starters" have plans for additional podcast series to be available behind the Athletic's paywall that could feature trivia games, mail bags and long-form interviews with local writers.
Adler said the company now has more than 100 distinct podcasts with the hopes of reaching 120 by the end of the year. Last month, the Athletic launched another free daily podcast, "The Lead," a general interest show that focuses on a single story each episode, similar to "The Daily" from the New York Times. The format for many of its team-specific audio offerings is one free episode per week and another behind the paywall. (Episodes of "No Dunks" will include advertisements.)
"It's about reaching a broader audience," Adler said. "I think we see putting things outside the paywall as a way for more people to find out about the Athletic."
Terms of the deal allow "The Starters" to pursue a separate deal for video content, meaning they could partner with another outlet on a rebooted TV show or simply simulcast tapings of the podcast.

Memo Shows White House Official's Alarm at Trump-Zelensky Call; The presidents' conversation is at the heart of a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump abused his office

Texto completo: President Trump's July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart had so alarmed a White House official that he called a colleague at the CIA the next day to share his concerns, according to a memorandum.
The memorandum, now in the possession of congressional investigating committees, was written by the Central Intelligence Agency official who eventually would file a formal complaint under federal whistleblower laws about Mr. Trump's interactions with Ukraine. The memo was shared with Congress last week by the Intelligence Community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, a congressional official said.
Mr. Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is at the heart of a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether the U.S. president abused his office by urging Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The two-page memorandum appears to provide further evidence that the call prompted early and deep concerns among some White House aides as well as officials at U.S. intelligence agencies.
The memorandum's existence was first reported by Fox News.

The whistleblower's identity hasn't been made public, and the name of the White House official who contacted him on July 26 hasn't been released.
Mr. Trump has defended his conduct with Ukraine, and his administration has broadly rebuffed congressional demands for testimony and documents in the impeachment inquiry.
An attorney for the whistleblower didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. At least one additional whistleblower, who has firsthand knowledge of the circumstances around the call, has come forward, according to lawyers representing both that individual and the CIA officer.
In his formal complaint filed on August 12, the initial whistleblower—who acknowledged he didn't have firsthand knowledge—wrote that "multiple White House officials with direct knowledge" of the phone call said Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.
"The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call," he wrote.

Texto completo: Inquiries were being made in 1919 in this and adjourning counties as to the whereabouts of Tim Bennett, who was last seen sitting in front of the grocery store of his brother Frank Bennett at Masonville. No reason is given for the strange disappearance of Mr. Bennett, who was a man of good habits and has been working at this brother's store. After the store had closed Saturday night, Bennett and several neighbors sat on the steps until midnight. Clarence Burdette was the last man to leave and was the last man to see and talk to the missing man. Mr. Bennett said nothing about going away. Several years ago, Mr. Bennett was badly wounded by being shot in the head by a man in Arizona. It is thought that his injury may be the cause of this strange conduct.
• Oct. 7, 1919, delegates of the Daviess County post of the American Legion have returned from the state convention held in Louisville. They report that the convention went on record as approving proposed legislation to provide extra compensation for all soldiers, sailors and Marines who served during the world war. Also, a resolution was passed asking the state legislature to provide free tuition in the state university and normal schools for all ex-servicemen.
• Oct. 8, one of the offenders who will be tried in Judge Well's court this morning will be May Hayden. Her trial was set for last Saturday but she failed to appear before the court. On Friday, she was taken to the Mary Kendall Home by the probation officer, being deemed a delinquent, dependent and neglected child. Her mother works at a hamburger stand and the girl has been left to do her own bidding.
• Oct. 9, for some time the former pupils of the late Dr. Wayland Alexander have been discussing plans for a drive for a memorial fund. They are contemplating holding a meeting in Owensboro in the near future for the purpose of perfecting and beginning active work. Dr. Alexander was one of the most noted educators of Western Kentucky and perhaps instructed more girls and boys than any other teacher in this section of the state. He taught for more than 50 years.
• Oct. 10, prior to the annual memorial service with nearly 8,000 persons assembled, the resolutions committee of the Confederate Veterans presented in its report a memorial to the United States Senate, urging speedy ratification of the peace treaty without amendment of textual reservations. Another resolution proposed to change the name of the war of 1861-1865 from the "Civil War" to the "Confederate War " on the grounds that the Confederate states had separated from the nation.
• Oct. 11, a new company to handle automobiles and operate a garage will be formed here in the near future it was announced after Andrew Bresler closed the deal for the purchase of the livery stable on Allen Street, occupied by J. W. Ellis. The building will be remodeled and made into an up-to-date garage. A new front will be constructed on the right side of the building. The name of the new company or the line of cars it will handle has not been decided upon.

• Oct. 8, General Electric Tube Department employees went on strike for the first time in a quarter of a century with a grievance on re-employment of persons on sick leave listed as the question at issue. The strike came after production was virtually shut down by a wildcat strike over a seniority question in the grid section, which announced a layoff of 200 persons effective Monday.
• Oct. 9, Jessie Hopwood Hughes, the Lewisport native who spent most of her life evaluating and recommending other people's books, will be in Owensboro with a book of her own. Titled "My Son Francis," the 179-page fictionalized biography of the "real" Francis Newberry of 18th century England has received critical acclaim. The New York Times called it fabulous reading for youths and adults. Mrs. Hughes will be the guest of honor at an autograph tea in the auditorium of the Owensboro Public Library.
• Oct. 10, for the first time, the Kentucky Ornithological Society, a branch of zoology dealing with birds, will hold its annual meeting in Owensboro. About 100 members are expected to register at Gabe's Inn. The 46th annual meeting of KOS will meet at the Owensboro Area Museum. This evening, four papers will be presented by members. These will include an illustrated talk on nighthawks, nesting practices of Western Kentucky cliff swallows and birds of the Eastern Kentucky mountains.

Giuliani says Kurt Volker knew about the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Bidens

Texto completo: President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Kurt Volker was aware of the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
That contradicts the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine's testimony to Congress, when Volker said, "At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden."
Giuliani told the Washington Examiner he disputed that Volker would’ve been unaware of this effort related to Ukraine and the Bidens — and the texts and testimony Volker provided indicate Volker was likely aware of what Giuliani was up to.

In his testimony, Volker distanced himself from the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked for a "favor" from Ukraine, urged Zelensky to look into any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election, and suggested the Ukrainians investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens.
But Giuliani had publicly advocated for Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens for months, both on Twitter and in numerous television appearances and news articles, and Giuliani and Volker spoke multiple times.
A person familiar with Volker's entire congressional testimony told the Washington Examiner that Volker was not aware of every conversation that Giuliani was having to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, that Volker didn't take the Trump attorney's public commentary seriously, and Volker didn't see Giuliani's activities as part of an official U.S. effort.
“New President of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of President Poroshenko,” Giuliani tweeted in June. “Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people.”
Volker considered that tweet and similar comments from Giuliani venting as bluster, not actual pressure being put on Ukraine, said the person familiar with Volker's discussion with lawmakers.
“Volker’s answers sound contradictory,” Giuliani told the Washington Examiner in a text message. “First he says he didn’t know, then he says I told him? Don’t understand?”
Volker also testified that “Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion” in his texts with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and U.S. chargé d’affaires to Ukraine William Taylor. A person who knew what Volker told Congress said that Biden may have been discussed by Volker, Sondland, and Taylor in meetings or by phone, but only in the context of all of them agreeing that the Ukrainian investigations shouldn't be about Biden specifically or about 2020.
The messages sent and received by Volker mention “investigations” four times — with an investigation into Burisma mentioned twice. Giuliani told the Washington Examiner “it was certainly understood,” including by Volker, that Giuliani wanted Burisma to be investigated in connection with Hunter Biden’s $50,000 per month position and because of Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine threatening to withhold $1 billion in loans while pushing for then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
The Biden camp and many others have countered that Shokin was widely seen by the United States and Europe — and inside Ukraine — as ineffective, corrupt, and a hindrance to Ukraine’s progress. Ukraine’s Parliament removed Shokin in 2016.
Volker and Giuliani never talked directly about Biden after the July meeting, but Volker and Giuliani did continue to talk about Burisma, a person familiar with what Volker told the House Intelligence Committee said, and Volker believed the Biden issue and the Burisma issue were not synonymous.
Volker testified he didn’t listen in on the July 25 phone call, and he was unaware of Biden being mentioned until the transcript was released.
Volker testified he learned in May that Giuliani “planned to travel to Ukraine to look into” these issues. Giuliani’s proposed trip became national news at the time, with the New York Times reporting Giuliani wanted Ukraine to investigate 2016 and the Bidens and Burisma. Giuliani said that “we’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Dozens of articles and television segments made it clear Giuliani was part of an effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

“Explain to me why Biden shouldn’t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while he was VP and point man for Ukraine,” Giuliani tweeted in May in response to a Democratic senator. “Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away. Let’s answer it now.”

Giuliani's calls for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens continued through the summer and the fall.
In the wake of Volker's testimony, Republicans pointed to his claim there was no quid pro quo related to withholding military aid to Ukraine, while Democrats pointed to Volker’s assertion that Biden’s actions in Ukraine weren’t improperly influenced by his son’s business dealings.

Texto completo: Fans of Leigh Bardugo's young adult work will recognize her artistic prose, cutting and witty characters and dark fantasy world building in her first adult novel, "Ninth House" (Flatiron, 480 pp. , ★★★½ out of four stars).
Bardugo is an acclaimed fantasy novelist, whose YA work "Shadow and Bone" is being adapted into a highly anticipated Netflix series. Those not familiar with Bardugo, or even YA literature, will still be delighted by this dark novel.
Set on the campus of Yale, "Ninth House" imagines that the school's secret societies are no longer just boys clubs but groups that create dark magic to manipulate stock markets and The New York Times bestseller list, see into the future and more. Alex Stern is a freshman when she enters Yale’s dangerous Lethe House, one of nine secret societies that practice magic; it polices the other houses on campus.
Alex is not another privileged student from a wealthy or even middle-class family. In fact, Alex would have never entered Lethe House or even stepped into the Ivy League world if not for the fact that she can see ghosts, or “Greys,” as they are called. If anything, Alex would have been another victim of the opioid epidemic if the members of Lethe had never found her in the hospital and invited her to Yale.
She is mentored by Darlington, a upperclassman who trains Alex in the dark arts until he mysteriously disappears at the end of her first semester. If that wasn’t bad enough, just as the spring semester starts, a young lower-income woman from New Haven, Connecticut, is discovered dead on campus. As part of Lethe House, Alex must investigate whether the murder and disappearance of Darlington have anything to do with the magic that lurks on campus.

"Ninth House" is as much a fantasy murder-mystery as it is an exploration of white privilege, corruption, misogyny and trauma. Bardugo highlights the vast gap between the lower-income neighborhoods that surround the campus and the toxic wealth hoarding of the school's most privileged students. New Haven itself is a character in the novel, one that never willingly bends to magic or wealth even as it drastically changes through gentrification.
The novel alternates between Alex's and Darlington's perspectives from the first semester to the second in Alex’s first year. As Alex sees the opportunity of a safe, more stable life for herself, she might have to trade it all for the truth.
"Ninth House" sometimes loses its characters' voices in the dense plot. The theme of privilege is so interwoven throughout the story that the book challenges readers to examine their own environment without being overtly on the nose. It helps that Alex is a straight-shooting, instinct-driven character who understands the game she is in more than the gamemakers themselves.

Texto completo: Let's say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon's involvement in Watergate – the scandal that drove him from the Oval Office in 1974, as House impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for "International Relations." But in terms of "Moral Authority" he's near the bottom, ranked 42nd.
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above.
Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how "the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint.
Strengthen workplace safety? "We want to protect our workers," Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so.
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut – to the wild applause of his base – what he's not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we've since learned – based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post – that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn't care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn't just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn't bother him, this is "giving them aid and comfort." The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon never would have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

Schiff not correct on whistleblower claim

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in September that the House Intelligence Committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filed.
But recent reporting from the New York Times revealed that Schiff, the committee chairman, had indeed learned about the outlines of the whistleblower’s concerns days in advance.
Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, per committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.
As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker first noted, this revelation flies in the face of Schiff’s public comments during the month of September, when he dodged questions about whether he or his committee had talked to the whistleblower and, in one case, denied that they had.
On Sept. 17, more than a week before the whistleblower’s complaint was made public, MSNBC’s Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard from the whistleblower and if he wanted to.
“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” Schiff said. “We would like to. But I’m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress, and so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation.”
The New York Times report, which quoted Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland acknowledging that “the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance,” shows that this statement was inaccurate.
While it was not publicly known that Schiff’s committee had communicated with the whistleblower ahead of the complaint’s filing, Schiff knew the truth. When given the chance to say that the whistleblower had reached out to a committee aide, he did not.
Schiff’s comments
The New York Times reported that the committee aide received only a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns. Without revealing the whistleblower’s identity, the aide then told Schiff “some of what the officer conveyed,” the report said. Other outlets reported similar details.
Previously, Schiff had given the impression that his committee never spoke to the whistleblower.
Before Schiff’s MSNBC interview — in which he flatly stated, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower” — Schiff also evaded a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper about whether he’d been contacted by the whistleblower or the whistleblower’s legal representation.
“I don’t want to get into any particulars,” Schiff said during the Sept. 16 interview. “I want to make sure that there’s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.”
Schiff has since clarified his remarks. He told the Daily Beast that until recently, he did not know for certain whether the complaint detailing the Trump-Zelensky call was submitted by the same whistleblower who contacted his staff.
He also said he thought the questions asking if the committee had heard from the whistleblower were focused on whether the whistleblower had testified privately in Congress.
“I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,” Schiff told the Daily Beast. “I regret that I wasn't much more clear.”
In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee said Schiff’s comments on MSNBC were “intended to answer the question of whether the committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not.”
“Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear,” the spokesperson said.
Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s counsel, declined to comment on the whistleblower’s outreach to committee staff but stressed that the whistleblower wrote the complaint “entirely on their own.” We addressed the false claim that Schiff helped write the complaint in a separate fact-check.
Our ruling
Schiff said, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.”
The New York Times and other news organizations later reported that the whistleblower sought guidance from a House Intelligence Committee staffer before formally lodging the complaint.
We rate this statement False.

World leaders can again make miracles

Texto completo: We need a little uplift, a reminder that although world leaders today from Washington to London to Beijing may be dishonest vandals, it doesn't have to be that way.
Even flawed presidents and prime ministers can act in noble ways, and we saw that in the 2000s when George W. Bush, Tony Blair and others made a heroic effort to tackle AIDS and malaria and save children's lives around the world.
European and American leaders backed the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which since 2002 has saved 32 million lives. That's not a misprint. And some 17 million of those lives are from PEPFAR, an AIDS program that Bush founded.
Then there's Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, created in 2000 with public and private backing: It has saved 13 million lives. We live in an age of miracles when a group of public health nerds, backed by world leaders and front-line health workers, can save lives by the million.
These may be the greatest successes in the history of human governance. Only half as many children now die worldwide as did in 2000. That's 5 million children's lives saved each year.
Yet today the kind of global leadership we saw in the early 2000s is gone. Bravo to French President Emmanuel Macron for remaining a supporter of multilateral aid, but he's the exception. President Donald Trump has tried to slash aid, although in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike have resisted, and Trump used his speech last month to the United Nations to preach nationalism.
I don't want to wax too nostalgic: Bush and Blair also collaborated in the catastrophic Iraq War. Still, at their best, they aimed to use their powers for a cause larger than themselves - while Trump, Boris Johnson and Xi Jinping worship only at their own altars.
In the heady days of the early 2000s, leaders pledged to donate at least 0.7% of national income in assistance to poor countries. The only countries that now do so are Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain. The U.S. donates 0.17%, and the average in the rich world is 0.31%.
So that's the conundrum: We have proved that we have the capacity to save lives, improve education and health, create opportunities for women and girls - yet we also seem to have lost interest.
Nations around the world have adopted 17 Global Goals - quality education, zero hunger, gender equity and so on - to achieve by 2030. We have a historic opportunity to end extreme poverty on our watch, but that will require more commitment in countries like the United States and Britain, and also in countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
One ray of sunshine: Leaders at the United Nations last month committed themselves to achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Here in America, we're still feuding about access to medical care, but countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan are showing that moving toward universal coverage is possible even with limited resources.
If these countries can manage it, why is the most powerful country in the history of the world stymied?
Universal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.
"That was always haunting me," Tedros told me.
Universal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.
"People ask what keeps me up at night," Tedros said. "My nightmare is a pandemic flu." One way to protect against such a pandemic - and against Ebola and other viruses - is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.
Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we'll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo.
By some reckoning, half the world's people can't get simple medical care, especially surgery. I'll never get over watching a mother of three, Prudence Lemokouno, die needlessly in a Cameroon hospital because she couldn't get a C-section.
Likewise, more than 800 women die wretchedly and painfully each day from cervical cancer, which in poor countries is sometimes diagnosed partly by the smell of rotting flesh. Cervical cancer is also overwhelmingly preventable with cheap HPV vaccinations, just $4.50 a dose, yet only about 15% of girls get the shot.
I worry that in the coming year, Trump and impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the room, making it impossible for us to think of anything other than him. Trump is critically important - but so are the 5 million children who will die this year, mostly for preventable reasons.

Trump impeachment: Nobody has right to face a whistleblower accuser

Texto completo: President Donald Trump says that "like every American," he deserves to meet his accuser ("the so-called 'Whistleblower' ") from the intelligence community. Compared with his earlier statement calling the anonymous whistleblower “almost a spy” and making a thinly veiled reference to execution, the president’s most recent request seems tame — almost reasonable.
In fact, it is anything but. As an attorney who represents courageous individuals who come forward to report fraud in a range of industries, I know just how essential confidentiality is to guarding the safety of whistleblowers and the integrity of the reporting process, and just how dangerous a precedent revealing the whistleblower’s identity could set.
The president is not entitled to “meet my accuser” any more than the general public is entitled to rule on the whistleblower’s credibility.
Retaliation and intimidation risks
As more information emerges on Trump's attempts to get Ukraine to do political favors for him, that notion seems to be up for debate even outside Trump's Twitter account. The New York Times, ignoring the chilling effect on future whistleblowers, revealed details about this whistleblower's employment history.
When faced with a backlash, Executive Editor Dean Baquet responded that “the president himself has called the whistleblower’s account a ‘political hack job,’ ” so the Times “wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible. ” Others have echoed the idea that revealing details about the whistleblower would somehow add to the credibility of his accusations.
It’s time to put this idea to rest. Revealing details about the national security whistleblower’s employment history will not further inform the public or help the government determine whether his allegations are credible. The identity of the whistleblower has nothing to do with the credibility of his information.
Consider the various programs that reward and protect whistleblowers who come forward with evidence of fraud in matters involving government agencies. These programs explicitly account for the vulnerability of the person reporting the fraud. Whistleblowers risk retaliation and intimidation, both from within their company and from other potential employers who might blacklist them — especially when they report misconduct at high levels of an organization.
Nobody gets to 'face' their accuser
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to protecting whistleblowers from threats to their safety and from being ostracized. It is also a way to ensure that potential whistleblowers are not discouraged by these risks and to incentivize them to come forward.
For this reason, the majority of federal whistleblower programs allow people to file reports of fraud under seal. The whistleblower’s confidentiality is preserved even as the government investigates the claim.
How Democrats should impeach Trump: A searing constitutional duty, a plan from two realists
At no time during the government’s investigation into a company or individuals accused of wrongdoing is the target of the investigation entitled or allowed to “face” the accuser. Nor is the whistleblower allowed to discuss the matter with anyone other than his or her attorney.
As part of its investigation, the government may confidentially interview the whistleblower, interview other witnesses or try to corroborate the report with other evidence. The emphasis throughout the investigation is on the credibility of the whistleblower’s allegations, rather than the identity of the person reporting wrongdoing.
Focus on identity is meant to distract
Intelligence community whistleblowers are in an especially precarious position. They have far fewer retaliation and safety protections than private sector whistleblowers. And the heightened media attention often makes them more vulnerable to threats from members of the public.
Case in point: Two Trump supporters offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who could provide further details of the whistleblower’s identity. As a result, the whistleblower’s lawyer reported that his client feared for his safety.
Keep the priorities straight: Pay attention to what Ukraine whistleblower reported, not motivations for speaking out
I know from experience that obsession with the identity of the whistleblower rather than the evidence supporting the allegations is a common tactic used by those accused of fraud. De-emphasizing the national security whistleblower’s identity and focusing on the evidence that results from his information should be our collective priority.
The House Ways and Means Committee is now investigating a federal whistleblower's report of improper influence at the Treasury Department in connection with a mandatory audit of Trump's taxes, and other intelligence officials are coming forward on the Ukraine allegations. We need to show these and future whistleblowers that we can get this right.
Debating the merits of revealing the national security whistleblower’s identity distracts from the investigation and the evidence it develops. That plays right into the hands of those seeking to detract from the gravity of the accusations against the president.
We should not fall into this trap.

Texto completo: PENOBSCOT -- I wish Mark Twain were still alive. Perhaps he is. Our times demand his observational clarity and wit, while at the same time exuding the American outlandishness of a Twain story. He was an arch commentator on American foibles, as well as creator of uniquely American plots and characters, confections of American archetypes.
Today's pundits and talking heads universally refer to our being in "uncharted territory." I feel it's not uncharted at all. We have simply stepped into the realm of our national fiction. Our writers forewarned us and previewed these swamp waters. It does, however, take an altered reality to trump fiction. Perhaps that is a working redefinition of "uncharted."
Who else but Twain, the inventor of American humor, could have imagined a comic-tragic plot like the Trump presidency? Only a Twain novel rivals the irony, hypocrisy, wicked reversals, manipulations, huckster rhetoric, bogus maxims and nefarious sub-textual dog whistles we are experiencing. A Twain villain gives piercing insight into American values and character; his heroes access our better, not baser, angels. His best-known observer, Huck Finn, elucidated our potential while being clear sighted about our flaws on his journey down the Big River in the heart of the nation.
Twain might sympathize with the president formerly known as The Donald. His own business ventures and catastrophes were legend. Had he backed the typewriter only a few years later than he did, he might have made a killing. He was ahead of his time. Twain would have ribbed Trump's failed ventures - steak, vodka, airline, casino, even a graduate school. A perfect, chaotic storm of ego-inflated greed. But he would not have brooked the criminal escapades of the family business. He would not have wailed, "Where's my Roy Cohn?" Cohn was Trump's dark Merlin from "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," an acrid later work about the human condition.
Humor, as we know, is only a shade lighter than some of our darkest, tragic ideations. Humor thwarts self-destruction. But when humor is overattenuated with tragedy, it's toxic. The knives turn inward. Real people bleed real blood.
Twain would have the words and phrases to fetch us back across the line from our acrimonious fratricidal tribalism. Fake news? The enemy of the people? Twain presided over a permissible application of such terms: literary sleight of hand.
I can laugh imagining Twain writing the March Oval Office scene reported by The New York Times in which President Trump pushes his Cabinet-level advisers to fill a border moat with snakes and alligators, shoot migrants in the legs, top the border wall with flesh-piercing spikes. It is unhinged whingeing right out of "A Connecticut Yankee." I cannot laugh at the scene as written in the nation's newspaper of record.
I offer a more sinister Twain correlative. In "Huckleberry Finn," Twain defines the soul of mob action. Colonel Sherburn shoots a man dead for slander - Trump's proverbial Fifth Avenue homicide-go-free - and the question becomes, what will the townspeople do about it?
The mob surges toward Sherburn, who stands his ground: "Why, a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind - as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him."
He continues his excoriation: "The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is - a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole."
And that's just what they do. And what will we do with our Sherburn? Huck, through whose eyes we witness the scene, has seen enough. "I could 'a' stayed if I wanted to," he says," but I didn't want to."
Ultimately, Twain delivers us from ourselves by delivering us to ourselves. And we hardly know that's what he's about. Is our president doing the same thing? Sherburn-like, he shoots a man and dares us to do something about it.
We gotta light out for the territory, as Huck finally does, where freedom awaits. We just gotta.

I worked in the White House during an impeachment. Trump's team isn't ready for it.

Texto completo: The period in early December 1998 just before the House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton has been on my mind lately. I've been thinking about those few weeks, the most harrowing of my career, ever since House Democrats announced they would launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. While I may not be rooting for Trump, I have a keen sense of what his staff is going through right now.
An impeachment inquiry exacerbates all the stresses and anxieties that already exist in any White House. The media magnifies the slightest development; dire predictions of imminent demise are commonplace. As press secretary -- a perilous job during normal times -- I personally felt the pressure to not make a mistake from the podium, with every word I spoke analyzed for both real and hidden meanings.
Throughout, members of the press breathed down our necks, sniffing for any material that could help them characterize "the mood in the White House." John Podesta, the chief of staff, had made clear, using quite colorful language, that he didn't want people talking about impeachment. Not in meetings, not at the proverbial water cooler and especially not out in public, even with family and friends. It was difficult to go through this period always being watched, and always pretending it wasn't happening.
Despite Podesta's admonition, the few staffers working on impeachment -- mostly lawyers and communications staff like me -- were constantly being asked what was going on. Everyone lived off rumors and secondhand information, studying the body language of the president and senior staffers. Several times a day, colleagues dropped by my office to "see how I was doing." No one got much sleep. Once, I remember working until about 4 a.m., getting about an hour's rest, and then my wife suddenly waking me up in the shower. I had been standing under the water, fast asleep.
We all developed a certain gallows humor. Bad jokes flew around: "If you see the vice president, tell him it looks like he's lost weight. He'll remember you when he starts filling out his staff." One memorable flight back from the Middle East was punctuated by phone calls in the Air Force One conference room, about Republicans we were losing on the impeachment vote. One staffer yelled out, "We've lost Jack Quinn," to groans. "Ben Gilman is now a yes on impeachment!" another added. I shouted, "We just lost Dick Gephardt!" -- the Democratic leader in the House. That got a big laugh.
Perhaps the defining aspect of this period was its sheer unpredictability. The best way to describe the experience is by recalling the day the president was impeached: Dec. 19, 1998. It was as normal a Saturday as you could expect, knowing that the vote was coming. We knew the outcome, and we had a strategy.
We would say this was all partisan, and the president would stay focused on the people's business. Simple. People in the administration believed it, and that was our message for that day.
Then, just before noon, Bob Livingston, R-La., the new speaker, went to the House floor and said he'd had an affair, and that the only honorable thing he could do was resign. Which he did, right there in the middle of the debate.
Our simple message was suddenly trumped by an even simpler one: Do something wrong, get caught, resign.
I estimated that we had about 15 minutes before everyone caught their breath and the television pundits started the drumbeat for the president, too, to resign.
I sprinted to the Oval Office to get President Clinton's reaction. While waiting for other staffers to arrive, I asked him not what we should say, but what he thought, and scribbled it down. Ten minutes after the meeting, I went to White House driveway and read it aloud, word for word.
That clear statement -- that it was wrong for Livingston to resign and that the politics of personal destruction had to stop -- seemed to break the fever before it fully spiked. Because the media largely focused on the president's plea for Livingston to reconsider, we avoided a full-scale outcry for him to resign.
After that, I dashed to a State of the Union planning meeting.
I remember sitting there, discussing issues like health care, education and gun safety, and thinking, we are going to get through this. Then, 10 minutes in, I was pulled away to meet with the national security staff. During the lead-up to the impeachment vote, we were about 10 days into a military action against Iraq. The military action was complete, and the national security team needed the president to announce it that evening. "You've got to be kidding me," I said. "Just last week, we launched this strike and said it had nothing to do with impeachment. Now you want to announce we won the war on impeachment day?" I politely inquired if we couldn't find more targets to hit. The national security team didn't think that was especially funny.
We had no choice but to handle what some might call a communications problem: delivering opposing messages from the president back to back. First, we had 150 members of Congress stand with the president on the South Lawn of the White House for a partisan pep rally. The impeachment was all about politics, Democrats are good, Republicans are not -- that was the gist.
Then, in the time it took to carry the presidential podium no more than 100 yards away, we moved inside to deliver a slightly different message. Flanked by America's military leaders, the president declared that we were not a country of Republicans and Democrats, but of Americans, bound together by patriotism.
He proclaimed the military action successfully completed, and he departed, leaving me to explain how these two messages -- us against them, and we are all in this together -- could fit.
At the end of this long day, I went back to the office. Waiting for me was a close colleague with two cold beers. We sat down, and I'll always remember what he said next: "You know, except for getting impeached, we had a pretty good day."
We survived the process because we were disciplined about keeping the president out of the impeachment debate. We had an aggressive and experienced legal, communications and political team. Most importantly, we never turned on one another. While being in the foxhole was never comfortable, it was comforting to know who was in there with me.
My sense is this White House has none of these things. Their lawyers have yet to develop a legal theory to extricate the president from his predicament and instead seem to be devoting all their energies to stonewalling Congress. No "war room" has been set up to plan the response -- any such operation "would be (an) overreaction on our part," Kellyanne Conway blithely told The New York Times. The political and communications infrastructure is nonexistent, with internal factions vying for control. In the meantime, the official response to developments seems to be whatever the first thing the president thinks to say. Everything seems to run from Trump's Twitter account.
Even if they had everything prepared, I still don't think they know what is about to hit them. With no signs of a strategy, and with a loose-cannon president, I can only wish this White House the best of luck. It will need it.

Texto completo: Anqwenique Kinsel is a new mom, which is a challenge enough for any woman but even more so for black women.
Pregnancy and motherhood can be more difficult for mothers facing racism or race-related trauma, according to a report in The New York Times. Black mothers are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related issues than white women.
But Kinsel wants black mothers and aunties to find self-care and healing amid a major societal health crisis.
Kinsel, an artist and the educational director at the Pittsburgh Festival Opera, reflected on the phrase "There Are Black People in the Future" and found it to be an intersection of her motherhood and her practice. Her goal with "Just Sing!" - a workshop she held in June made possible by the residency - was to give black women control over stress and trauma through singing and vocal exercises. Her husband, D.S. Kinsel, co-founder of BOOM Concepts, also is a recipient of one of the art residency grants.
Her workshop - more will be planned in the future - is about "reminding people that your voice is an instrument and a gift," she said.
Participants begin by relaxing in a space with prompts about their lives, such as their favorite songs to sing in the shower. People mix and mingle, enjoy nourishment and discuss the prompts before getting together for a guided discussion. The women of the workshop share resources, and then she leads exercises in breathing, singing and group singing. She ends the session with additional exercises on singing to your child.
She describes the place as relaxed and free, an important night of oral tradition where women share resources and learn self-care.
The workshop is focused on and centered around black women, specifically mothers and aunts, although the general public won't be turned away. Her last edition of the workshop was a small gathering at BOOM Concepts, 5139 Penn Ave., Garfield, with many of the women from the Pittsburgh Black Breastfeeding Circle.
Kinsel will announce future workshops on BOOM Concepts' Facebook page: facebook.com/boomconcepts.
"It doesn't feel complete," she said. "It's a work in progress."

Texto completo: Patrick Soren Roberts and Jose A. Del Real were married Sept. 30 in Leidig Meadow at Yosemite National Park in California. Autrey Nassar, a Universal Life minister, officiated on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley.
Mr. Roberts (left), 44, is a political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. He is an associate professor at Virginia Tech's School of Public and International Affairs in Arlington, and the author of "Disasters and the American State: How Politicians, Bureaucrats, and the Public Prepare for the Unexpected." (Cambridge University Press, 2016). He graduated cum laude from the University of Dallas, received a master's degree in political philosophy from Claremont Graduate University in California and a doctoral degree in government from the University of Virginia.
He is the son of Sharon A. Roberts of Austin, Texas, and John M. Roberts of Victoria, Texas, and the stepson of Donna A. Roberts. His mother retired as a computer scientist at the University of Texas. His father retired as the publisher of The Victoria Advocate, a newspaper in Victoria.
Mr. Del Real, 29, is based in Los Angeles as a domestic correspondent for the national desk of The New York Times. He graduated cum laude from Harvard.
He is a son of Josefina Perez and Jose M. Del Real-Soto of Monte Escobedo, Zacatecas, in Mexico. His mother retired as a housekeeper at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage. His father raises cattle on a family ranch in Zacatecas.
The couple met in 2015 at a mutual friend's party in Washington, but did not start dating until a year later, after they ran into each other and then met for a drink at a Washington bar. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Del Real said they decided to elope to Yosemite, partly to find some tranquillity, easier to achieve in a place with limited cellphone service.

Texto completo: Un segundo oficial de inteligencia está considerando presentar una queja y testificar ante el Congreso sobre sus preocupaciones sobre los tratos del presidente Trump con Ucrania, informó el New York Times el viernes, citando a dos personas informadas sobre el asunto.
The Times informó que el oficial tiene más información directa sobre la situación que involucra a Trump que el primer denunciante, cuya queja presentada en agosto ayudó a provocar la investigación de juicio político contra Trump que la Cámara demócrata lanzó la semana pasada, reporta The Hill.
Según los informes, el Inspector General de la Comunidad de Inteligencia Michael Atkinson entrevistó a la persona para corroborar las afirmaciones originales del denunciante.
Trump ha criticado repetidamente al primer denunciante no identificado, cuestionando sus motivos y acusando que son “partidistas”.
Mientras tanto, el Director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire, dijo al Congreso a fines de septiembre que creía que el denunciante hizo lo “correcto” al presentar su queja.
El denunciante presentó su queja por preocupaciones sobre la llamada telefónica de Trump al presidente de Ucrania a fines de julio en la que Trump presionó al líder extranjero para que iniciara una investigación sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden , un destacado candidato presidencial demócrata.
Una transcripción aproximada de la llamada emitida por la Casa Blanca dada a conocer la semana pasada, corroboró varios puntos clave en la queja del denunciante relacionada con la conversación de Trump con el líder ucraniano.
El denunciante original no tenía conocimiento directo de la conversación, pero escribió que obtuvo información de “múltiples funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con conocimiento directo”.
El presidente Trump y otros republicanos han atacado la credibilidad de la persona.
Mientras tanto, los demócratas dijeron que el testimonio de Atkinson el viernes ante la Cámara confirmó detalles importantes del llamado de Trump con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky .
“Exploramos con el Inspector General (IG) a través de documentos y testimonios las razones por las cuales encontró que la denuncia de denunciantes era urgente y creíble”, dijo el presidente del Comité de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff en un comunicado. “Ahora que todos hemos visto el registro de llamadas, podemos ver que la determinación del IG fue correcta en ambos aspectos “.
El Times informó el viernes que no estaba claro si Atkinson informó a los legisladores que el segundo funcionario estaba pensando en presentar una queja.
The Hill se comunicó con la oficina del inspector general de la comunidad de inteligencia para obtener comentarios y aún no ha recibido respuesta.

Grassley right: Whistleblowers trump politics

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley's long and leading advocacy for protection of whistleblowers - insiders who confidentially report fraud, waste, mismanagement or misconduct - might well have been put to the test the last week or two.
After all, the senior senator from Iowa is a Republican, and the man in the eye of the nation's biggest whistleblower storm, President Trump, is the GOP standard-bearer.
In response to a whistleblower's report that Trump abused his presidential power by pressuring the leader of a foreign government (Ukraine) to investigate a possible election rival (Joe Biden), the president has pulled out all the stops in attacking the unidentified whistleblower, depicting himself as a political martyr and warning of a civil war. All of it could well undermine the foundation of whistleblowing programs everywhere.
Trump's personal attacks (against an unidentified target), the unsubstantiated allegations (such as the whistleblower is a traitor who had only "second-hand" information) and the claim that he is "entitled" to know and even interview the whistleblower (whom he calls his "accuser") clearly demonstrate either ignorance or disrespect for the process.
A whistleblower is not an investigator. A whistleblower is not a prosecutor. A whistleblower reports, and then it's up to investigators and prosecutors to dig deeper for the facts. Think of a whistleblower as a hunting dog, pointing at what might not otherwise be visible; what happens next is up to the hunter.
Chuck Grassley gets all that. For decades, he has promoted and defended whistleblowers through legislation and his public statements. But until now, the issue did not involve the president of the United States - and the leader of his own political party.
It might have taken a tick or two longer than if the subject of the report had a D behind his or her name, but Grassley has spoken out in defense of the whistleblower process, even as it involves Trump.
"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers," Grassley said on Tuesday. "Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility."
His position reflects a clear break with many if not most of his Republican colleagues and the president's surrogates, some of whom are defending Trump even to the point of making stuff up. But this is not the first time Grassley has broken with the party line, and it's likely not the last.
The political news website Politico further quoted Grassley regarding questions asked at confirmation hearings. "They all say they're going to respect whistleblowers but they end up not doing it. Every Cabinet person that comes in is well intended about protecting whistleblowers and then they're treated like a skunk at a picnic."
The news media are not getting a free pass from the senator. He criticized outlets that reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer. Such disclosures by the media "don't serve the public interest," he said, "even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks." (The New York Times and Washington Post were the first to carry that limited identification. That information was subsequently included in articles by The Associated Press, whose reports have appeared in the TH.)
No one can predict for sure what will come out of the investigation of the whistleblower's complaints, the impeachment inquiry and the international and domestic fallout. But it is heartening to see the Iowan Grassley put partisan pressure aside and remain an outspoken if lonely defender of whistleblowers.
Editorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board.
Where we stand
It's heartening that Sen. Chuck Grassley has put partisanship aside to defend the whistleblower at the heart of the Trump-Ukraine issue.

Texto completo: NEW YORK—Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a nonservant role in a TV series as "Julia," has died. She was 84.
Ms. Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.
During her long career, Ms. Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical "No Strings" and an Academy Award nomination for "Claudine."
But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on "Julia." Ms. Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.
Although she wasn't the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series "Beulah"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.
NBC executives were wary about putting "Julia" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.
It had its critics, though, including some who said Ms. Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, wasn't a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.
"They said it was a fantasy," Ms. Carroll recalled in 1998. "All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family."
Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Ms. Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical "No Strings." Critic Walter Kerr described her as "a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin."
She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: "Same Time, Next Year," ''Agnes of God" and "Sunset Boulevard."
"I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention," she said in 2002.
Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in "Carmen Jones" in 1954 and five years later appeared in "Porgy and Bess," although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included "Goodbye Again," ''Hurry Sundown," ''Paris Blues," and "The Split."
The 1974 film "Claudine" provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.
In the 1980s, she appeared in the prime-time soap opera "Dynasty" for three years. More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on "Grey's Anatomy."
She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang "Both Sides Now" with "the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap."
Carol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.
She began her career as a model, but a prize from "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" TV show led to nightclub engagements.
In her 1998 memoir "Diahann," Ms. Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.
An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.
Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.
After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.
"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric," Ms. Carroll told a gathering in 2000.

Schiff's Shifty Timeline

Texto completo: If the latest impeachment push continues to backfire, Democrats can thank their duplicitous House Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff.
The New York Times reported this week that the "whistleblower" who set off the latest inquisition provided an "early warning" to Mr. Schiff's committee that he or she was filing a complaint over Donald Trump's July 25 call to Ukraine's president. The media is now at pains to stress that whistleblowers do sometimes reach out to Congress, that all "procedures" were followed, and that what really matters is the accusation that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
Actually, it matters a great deal that Mr. Schiff knew about this early and withheld it deliberately from both the public and his House colleagues. He used his advance information to lay the groundwork steadily for later exploitation of the issue. He went so far as to charge the White House with a coverup -- of a complaint he already knew about. The timeline of this orchestrated campaign is another knock to the legitimacy of the so-called impeachment inquiry. If the public can't trust Mr. Schiff to be honest about the origins of his information, why should they trust his claim that the information itself is serious?
Mr. Schiff on Sept. 13, a Friday night, issued the explosive news that he had been alerted a few days earlier by the intelligence community's inspector general of an "urgent" yet unspecified whistleblower complaint. But the complaint is dated Aug. 12, and news reports now say the whistleblower interacted with Mr. Schiff's staff prior to then. So Mr. Schiff knew about the topic of the complaint for more than a month -- while the public did not. It is now clear why the intelligence chairman in that month suddenly developed an interest in all things Ukrainian, and began aggressively previewing his impeachment mantra.
On Aug. 23, for instance, Mr. Schiff tweeted that Mr. Trump tried to "get dirt on a political opponent" via personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interaction with the office of the Ukrainian president. On Aug. 28, the chairman tweeted his newfound concern that Mr. Trump was "withholding vital military aid to Ukraine." And on Sept. 9, Mr. Schiff suddenly announced his committee would launch a full-fledged investigation into whether Mr. Trump was trying to "pressure Ukraine to help the President's re-election campaign." All this was priming the public and the media for what was to come -- the better to take full advantage of the whistleblower "news."
Yet even after news broke of the complaint, Mr. Schiff played dumb. On Sept. 17, he flatly (and falsely) stated on MSNBC: "We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower." Two days later, he thanked the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, without whom "we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint." Really? Mr. Schiff wanted to make it sound as if the Trump administration was muzzling the complainant, when in fact the process was working and Mr. Schiff knew all about it.
The chairman also actively kept his information secret from Republicans on his committee. GOP members confirm that Mr. Schiff had multiple opportunities to acknowledge his awareness of the coming complaint, but kept mum about his side's early involvement. That included even during the committee's closed-door Sept. 19 briefing with Mr. Atkinson.
The whistleblower's early communication with the committee also bears on the complaint's credibility. The Times story explains that the whistleblowing Central Intelligence Agency officer initially alerted the CIA's top lawyer to concerns. Yet before even waiting for this procedure to play out, the officer went to Mr. Schiff's staff. This act has to be measured in light of Mr. Atkinson's acknowledgment that the source demonstrated an "arguable political bias . . . in favor of a rival candidate." It has become urgent that Republicans demand more information about the whistleblower's history and motivations -- questions that are central to any whistleblower complaint, but particularly one being used as a basis for impeachment.
If all this has a somewhat familiar feel of subterfuge and ambush, it should. The episode is redolent of the sneak attack on Brett Kavanaugh. An unknown person levels nasty allegations; a Democratic lawmaker (in that case, Sen. Dianne Feinstein) conceals the claim before springing it at an opportune moment; the media jumps on board to distort and inflame the story. Lost in the carnage are little things like fairness, standards and due process.
Mr. Schiff's staff is suggesting its interaction with the whistleblower was limited. Maybe, but given Mr. Schiff's recent deceptions, it's reasonable to ask more questions about how involved his committee was with the creation of this complaint. The Democratic claim that Mr. Trump's Ukraine call rose to the level of impeachment was always absurd. But Americans have even more reason to doubt the legitimacy of this push in light of Mr. Schiff's scheming exploitation of the whistleblower charge.

Sanders's Campaign Says He Will Be Ready for Democrats' Next Debate

Texto completo: The Vermont senator's wife said he is in good spirits and should be able to return home by the end of this coming weekend.
Senator Bernie Sanders, recovering in a Las Vegas hospital from a procedure to treat a clogged artery, should be able to return home by the end of this weekend and will participate in the next Democratic debate, his wife, Jane Sanders, said Thursday.
"Bernie is up and about," Ms. Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. "We expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend."
Mr. Sanders's campaign has declined to say whether he had suffered a heart attack, and his wife's statement did not address that.
On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders's campaign said he experienced "some chest discomfort" during an event on Tuesday evening; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. He has canceled a two-day college tour this week in California, and his aides have not said when he would return to the campaign trail.
Placing stents in arteries is a common procedure, and patients generally return home within a day or two. Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home.
Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders's apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel's anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, "is not typical unless there is an additional issue."
Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders's event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack -- defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle -- or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one.
With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around -- as Mr. Sanders was originally-- the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort.
In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were "pleased" with Mr. Sanders's progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures.
Former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada visited Mr. Sanders on Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders "looked really good."
He said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but "jumped right up" when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders's campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said.
"Bernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he's a very serious man always," Mr. Reid said. "He feels good, he smiled."
Internally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. "We are not taking our foot off the gas," Ms. Turner said.
Still, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders's age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates -- Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- are all in their 70s.
But if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign and prepare for the next debate on Oct. 15.
In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability -- an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $ 25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it.
Mr. Sanders's heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $ 1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa.
In an update on Thursday, the campaign said that it would begin airing the ad on Tuesday, and that it would run for two weeks as it had planned.
The Sanders campaign's reluctance to provide much information about his health has also not helped to quell concern.
Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any candidate this cycle, said the Sanders campaign should be in "rapid response mode and giving out as many answers about Sanders's health as possible before more questions pile up."
"If everything is fine," she said, "The campaign should be operating as normal."
Since Wednesday, campaign aides have been trying to put the episode in a positive light, with some tweeting and retweeting well-wishes and encouragement. Surrogates and supporters have also expressed their solidarity. Some supporters have leveraged the episode into a rallying cry for fund-raising.
Mr. Sanders himself sent out a tweet on Wednesday thanking his well-wishers and using the opportunity to plug "Medicare for all." The tweet prompted some allies to praise him for being so devoted to his message.
The campaign said several surrogates would visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this weekend.

Texto completo: In a series of tweets he shared Wednesday, New York Times and CNN commentator Wajahat Ali wrote his daughter, Nusayba, had successfully undergone a transplant with a portion of a living donor's liver. He wrote she will stay in the hospital for a week or two while she recovers.
"I told the donor's family my life belongs to them and begged them to tell me how I can repay them," Ali wrote. "They just said to pray for the donor, their family member, and they wanted Nusayba to live a long, healthy life. There's still much goodness in the world. Don't lose hope, ever."
One of the first questions the anonymous donor asked after waking up from their surgery was when they could donate blood again, Ali wrote.
The surgery had been scheduled with a different donor, but the doctor discovered a last-minute complication.
At a TED Talk in April, Ali disclosed that Nusayba, who was 2 years old at the time, had been diagnosed with Stage 4 liver cancer.
He had just found out about it the day before from his wife, Sarah, who encouraged him to stay in Vancouver to give his talk rather than come home right away. The topic was "The case for having kids."
More than 500 people, most of them strangers, eventually applied to be liver donors for Nusayba. Doctors found a match and went forward with the transplant.

Traffic stop turned fresh start: Florida sergeant delivers baby
When Sgt. David Drucks pulled over a speeding motorist Tuesday near Naples, Fla., he got a big surprise: A passenger in the vehicle was about to give birth.
Drucks quickly called for EMS, and then grabbed a blanket from his car, the Collier County Sheriff's Office said. The sergeant successfully delivered the baby, a girl.
Mother and child were fine and healthy when EMS arrived to cut the umbilical cord and take them to the hospital.
Drucks managed to grab a photo with the joyful father. The image has been shared 1,200 times since and received more than 7,000 positive reactions since it was posted.

Texto completo: AMSTERDAM -- In 1998, Sirak Asfaw, a Dutch civil servant who was born in Ethiopia, noticed something shiny in the suitcase of a guest who was staying at his house. Curious, he opened the case to find a glittering gilded crown inside.
"I couldn't believe my eyes," Mr. Sirak, who moved to the Netherlands a political refugee in the 1970s, said in a recent interview in Amsterdam. "I felt betrayed. Using my house to smuggle cultural heritage from Ethiopia? I knew it had something to do with Ethiopian history, the Ethiopian kingdom. I knew this is not good."
Mr. Sirak said that he felt he couldn't return the crown to the Ethiopian authorities, because he suspected that the government might have been complicit in the theft, and he feared that it would be stolen again.
He also didn't want to hand it over to the Dutch authorities, because he worried that a museum would keep the crown forever rather than returning it when a new Ethiopian government was in place.
So Mr. Sirak locked the visitor out of his house, he said, and removed the crown from the suitcase. He did not identify the smuggler to The New York Times for fear of his safety, and said he didn't know how his guest had acquired it.
For 21 years, he hid it in his home. "When I saw it, I always felt very emotional," he said. "I knew it shouldn't be here, not in my house, not in the Netherlands."
Last year, after Ethiopia installed a new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, Mr. Sirak decided that it was time to try to return the crown, confident that the new government would handle the return properly, he said.
He contacted an independent Dutch art crimes investigator, Arthur Brand, who placed the crown in a high-security art facility in the Netherlands and alerted the Dutch police.
Toon van Wijk, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an email exchange with The Times that officials were investigating. "Authenticity must be determined in cooperation with the Ethiopian authorities," he said. "Once the investigation has been completed, we must look at the next steps."
The Ethiopian ambassador to the Netherlands, Million Samuel Gebre, said in a telephone interview that discussions were underway with Ethiopia's Ministry of Tourism and Culture to return the work either to the church from which it was stolen or to a museum in Ethiopia.
"It's up to Ethiopian stakeholders to decide where it should go," he said.
Jacopo Gnisci, a research associate at Oxford University who specializes in Ethiopian artifacts, examined the crown in Amsterdam a few weeks ago and said he thought it was authentic.
He believes it was probably a liturgical crown used in Orthodox Christian ceremonies. Mr. Gnisci also tracked down a photograph in which a priest is wearing the crown in 1993, a few years before it disappeared.
The crown was probably stolen in the 1990s from a church in the village of Cheleqot, 75 miles from the border with Eritrea, Mr. Gnisci said.
The researcher said it was a rare object, one of only about 20 such liturgical crowns in existence.
"If I had to put a price tag on it, I'd say 40,000 to 50,000 euros" -- about $ 44,000 to $ 55,000 -- Mr. Gnisci said in a telephone interview. That figure, he said, "is at the highest possible end of the market for Ethiopian artifacts, just under the price you'd fetch for an illuminated manuscript."
The object has surfaced at a time of increased international debate about the return of African art and artifacts to their places of origin.
President Emmanuel Macron of France made a pledge in 2017 that he would prioritize the "temporary or permanent restitution" of African artifacts to their countries of origin within the next five years. A report, commissioned by Mr. Macron and released in 2018, recommended the return of some objects from French museums.
But "not much further has happened" since then, said Dr. Barbara Plankensteiner, a former curator of African art at Yale University Art Gallery.
Nevertheless, she added, "the whole environment in public opinion and among political decision makers is much more open to restitution now than it was five years ago."
Ethiopian officials have been working with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to seek the return of 19th-century Ethiopian objects, including a crown, a chalice, a wedding dress and jewelry, that were looted by British troops. This year the museum's director, Tristram Hunt, said he was discussing a plan to loan the works to Addis Ababa for a temporary exhibition.
In April, the National Army Museum in London returned two locks of hair from the head of a 19th-century Ethiopian emperor, which had been a part of its collection, after a request from the country.
Mr. Gnisci said he thought the Ethiopian crown found by Mr. Sirak would be a test of Ethiopia's ability to care for such objects.
"There are a number of really important medieval ecclesiastical sites and ecclesiastical treasures that are every day at risk of destruction because of neglect and a lack of conservation measures," Mr. Gnisci said. "There's a lot more work that needs to be done in the country, so hopefully this will encourage the government to work more closely and more carefully on its heritage."
Mr. Sirak said he would like for the crown to be given to the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.
"That's the safest place for it, but I trust that the Ethiopian government will take care of it," he said. "Now it is in safe hands, and I'm a bit relieved."

Trump's wrongs don't make a right for Bidens

Texto completo: Let's be clear: President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was not "beautiful" or "perfect." Far from it. Trump should not have asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani's investigation of the former vice president's son. Since Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors." But it was highly inappropriate.
However, it does not follow that Trump's malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Biden's actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN's Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, "according to the Ukrainians that investigation (into Burisma) was dormant at the time."
First, the phrase "dormant" means, by definition, that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don't know for certain that the Burisma investigation was, in fact, "dormant." Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don't get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, "conflict-of-interest rules should have applied."
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma "focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board." Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president's son? According to The New York Times, Biden's hiring "allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans." As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, "It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter's foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter's relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him." The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Biden knew about his son's involvement with Burisma, because the New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein "raised the matter with Biden." We also know, via The New York Times, that "some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine could complicate his father's diplomacy there." No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect "a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship" and "the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter." In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Shokin deserved to be fired, Biden had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden's business dealings, in Ukraine and elsewhere, are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact that Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Biden family.

Cal Thomas: Whistleblower’s complaint feels a bit slimy

Texto completo: Back when reruns were a staple of summer programming, television networks aired repeats of their programs, giving viewers another opportunity to see what they had already seen. Democratic politicians are now conducting their own version of reruns.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
The same bunch who brought us the failed Russian “collusion” story, the sliming of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and charges that President Trump is a racist (which also failed, given the spectacular increase in minority employment), are now rerunning the same show with different characters.
According to a still anonymous “whistleblower,” who wrote a multi-page “complaint” about a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that he or she heard about secondhand from another unnamed person, President Trump held back military aide to Ukraine until “dirt” on Joe Biden and his son Hunter could be provided. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, which paid him $3.1 million over a 16-month period. This when his father was vice president of the United States and, according to Bloomberg, pursing “…an anti-corruption policy in Ukraine … that included a call for the resignation of the country’s top prosecutor who had previously investigated Burisma.”
Ukraine’s prosecutor general has since come out and said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, but something doesn’t pass the smell test.
The New York Times reports the whistleblower is a CIA agent who was on loan to the White House. I have known several CIA agents and two directors of the CIA — George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss — and none were known for the kind of prose contained in the complaint. The document appears to have been written by a team of lawyers with a political objective, namely impeachment of the president.
This is a view shared by Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Fleitz is also a former deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council (NSC).

Writing in The New York Post, Fleitz says: “I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.
“My suspicions grew … when I saw the declassified whistleblower complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff.”
When it comes to an impeachable offense, there is no there, there.
Like other attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election, this one should also fail if Republicans stick together, as Democrats did during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) revealed his party’s true motives when he said that if Trump isn’t impeached he will be re-elected.
There are deeper issues for 2020. They include capitalism vs. socialism; higher unemployment vs. lower; judges who revere and obey the Constitution vs. judges who wish they had written it and know what the Founders intended better than the Founders; government health care vs. reforms in the current system to make it better; greater dependence on government vs. an expansion of individual liberty; rewarding initiative and success vs. penalizing the successful with higher taxes and more regulations.
Don’t expect President Trump to start quoting this line from the Ukraine national anthem, but it could prove prophetic if Democrats fail in their latest cynical attempt to impeach him: “Like the dew before the sun, enemies will fade. We will further rule and prosper in our promised land.”

Texto completo: Dear reader:
“The country is not as divided as the media make it seem.”
That’s a quote from a participant in a recent election survey experiment called “America in One Room.” As the name indicates, the project brought together a representative sample of voters from around the country, reflecting the nation’s deep divides on partisanship, ideology, and identity. Over the course of a long weekend in Dallas, they held small-group discussions on five hot-button topics: immigration, healthcare, the environment, the economy, and foreign policy.
Many participants experienced significant shifts in thought. “Republicans became more welcoming of immigration and less punitive in their attitudes,” the researchers write in The New York Times. Support for making undocumented immigrants return to their home countries, for example, fell from 45 to 25 percent. Democrats shifted notably on economic issues – support for a federal minimum wage dropped by 23 percentage points.
The conversations also had a marked effect on people’s confidence in our democratic institutions: The percentage who said America’s system of democracy was “working well” rose from 30 percent to 60 percent.
Many groups have undertaken similar efforts in recent years, anecdotally confirming what “America in One Room” was able to measure: When you bring people of opposing views together for thoughtful discussions, the nation’s partisan divide shrinks.
The challenge, of course, lies in the “bringing together” part. Partisanship is now correlated with geography – Democrats are clustered in cities (and, increasingly, suburbs); Republicans dominate in exurban and rural areas. The lack of regular contact between Democrats and Republicans has led to a decrease in understanding. But overcoming a geographic divide is easier said than done.
And while physical distance isn’t an issue in virtual communities, those spaces are increasingly segregated as well. The participants in Dallas were given a 55-page handbook with arguments for and against each policy proposal. Most voters today get their information in a piecemeal fashion from media sources or peers that simply reinforce previously held views.
Still, the “America in One Room” researchers highlight their project’s value as a measure of public opinion – revealing Americans’ “considered judgments” following discussion and deliberation, rather than the “surface impressions” most polling reflects.
“It was interesting how many times people agreed at the heart of an issue, but just had slight differences in how to go about making needed changes,” participant Joan Young told CNN. "I was very hopeful after seeing the way our small group behaved.”

Maine GOP will follow Democrats in holding a new presidential primary in 2020

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Republican Party will hold a presidential primary in March as it looks to renominate President Donald Trump, following Democrats in using a new law allowing a move from party-run caucuses to the first nominating primaries here since 2000.
The Democratic-led Legislature passed a law allowing the switch to state-run primaries this year after the 2016 election was marked by crowded municipal caucuses on the Democratic side and hard-to-reach regional caucuses on the Republican side. The shift is optional for parties.
The two parties are in much different positions approaching the 2020 election. The Republican National Committee has melded with Trump's re-election campaign and he faces only longshot challengers in his own party, while 19 well-known Democrats are running for the nomination.
Six Republican state parties have canceled presidential caucuses or primaries, according to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Republicans in 19 states did that for incumbent George W. Bush in 2004 and Democrats in 13 states did it in 2012 for Barack Obama, neither of whom faced serious primary opposition.
Maine won't be one of them. The party's state committee voted unanimously in September to hold a primary, said Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party. He said it was the best way to conform to state law and party rules while ensuring the highest turnout by allowing Republicans to vote in their towns.
"It seemed like the smart thing to do and the most people will be able to participate," he said.
Savage said all of Maine's delegates will be awarded to a candidate who wins more than 50 percent of votes. The New York Times reported Wednesday that state delegate plans -- due to the national party this week -- follow a Trump campaign effort to avoid a contentious national convention in 2020. Maine Republicans had a similar 50 percent rule during the 2016 caucuses.
The decision leaves a small opening for Trump's challengers -- former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois -- though a national poll released Wednesday by The Economist and YouGov said Trump had 87 percent support from Republicans, while Weld had 2 percent. The others had 1 percent each.
Under the new law, all Republican and Democratic primary candidates will still have to get signatures from at least 2,000 registered voters to appear on the ballot. Savage said that would be "a heavy lift for anybody who doesn't have organizational infrastructure here."
Savage said the party made its decision in part because of how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills handled a new law enshrining ranked-choice voting in presidential races. It will be used in the general election, but she delayed the law's effective date until after the March 3 primaries.
Republicans generally oppose the voting method that Maine became the first state to use in after a 2016 referendum. Savage said members do not want to be forced to use it.

Democrats Lost in Ukrainia

Texto completo: As the Trump impeachment narrative descends into the familiar bog of incomprehensibility, some guidance: Do not confuse Ukraine with Ukrainia.
Ukraine is a real country. Ukrainia is an imaginary place created by the national Democratic Party and the Washington press corps.
It was probably inevitable that after 2 1/2 years of the Trump presidency, the Democrats and the press would end up in Ukrainia. For years, they have accused Mr. Trump, with some justification, of creating his own reality. Last week, they decided to create their own.
This story began two weeks ago, on a Thursday, with reports of a whistleblower filing a complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general about Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the real president of the real Ukraine. For about 48 hours, the issue was simple: Had Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter?
That Sunday, Mr. Trump said he did bring up Mr. Biden during a conversation about corruption. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she had approved a formal inquiry into Mr. Trump's impeachment. Then, in what became the working headline for everything else last week, "the dam broke."
If you live in Peoria, most likely you can't fully understand the meaning of "the dam broke." It's not that people in Peoria don't know what's going on. But like virtually everyone today, they get most of their news from screens -- on cellphones, PCs or television. That isn't how Washington gets the news.
Besides the inevitable screens, people working in Washington still get their news as they did during the Watergate scandal -- from the front pages of the print editions of national newspapers.
Those front pages were once the political world's official dam, releasing information into the world at a rate appropriate to the news of the day. Last week, that dam collapsed in an indiscriminate torrent.
The day after the White House released the text of Mr. Trump's conversation with Mr. Zelensky, the New York Times, under a banner headline -- "Trump Asked for 'Favor' in Call, Memo Shows" -- spread a reproduction of the transcript across the top half of the page, with six sections highlighted portentously in yellow marker. That day's Washington Post filled its first section with an astounding 19 separate "impeachment inquiry" stories, each more or less pegged to this single transcript.
On Friday, the Times returned with another banner headline: "Complaint Asserts a White House Cover-Up." Below that, again filling the top half of the page, is text from the unnamed whistleblower's semi-hearsay complaint and the inspector general's letter.
This is Ukrainia, the impeachment world inhabited by Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler and the rest of Washington -- a world of newspaper melodrama, nonstop talking heads and hysterical social-media posts.
It's hard to recall the paint-by-numbers story line that presumably caused Nancy Pelosi to pull the trigger on impeachment -- the notion that Mr. Trump's raising the investigation of a political opponent in a national-security conversation with a foreign leader was an abuse of presidential power and an impeachable offense.
At long last, the Democrats believed, they had a violative Trump act the public could understand, as opposed to what the New York Times described -- with an utter absence of irony -- as "months of murky messaging around a confusing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign."
It is barely a fortnight since this "understandable" impeachment charge emerged and already the story line is descending, again, into deep insider minutiae and ultimately something incomprehensible to the general public.
Adam Schiff -- who admitted Wednesday that the sainted whistleblower touched base with the House Intelligence Committee days before unloading the complaint against Mr. Trump -- is as always carpet-bombing the administration with subpoenas. He wants Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify. He wants to depose a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and various others in the U.S. diplomatic corps no one's ever heard of. George Papadopoulos must be in there somewhere.
Meanwhile, the real Ukrainians look like they don't want to pursue the matter further, and that includes Mr. Trump's predictable exhortation to investigate Joe Biden.
The Democrats will fall back on the media to keep the impeachment game going, which it will. For much of the media, its primary activity has become feeding a voracious internet, which means the most minimally relevant anti-Trump stories are reported in microscopic detail whose purpose is to hold on to eyeballs with a permanent and presumably addictive sense of dread.
Politicians like Nancy Pelosi used to be better at assessing the political importance of events, but their judgment is now being overwhelmed by the ideological frenzies of modern media, culminating in the past two wild weeks.
For more than two years, the Democrats have asked the American people to buy into a succession of Trump takedowns -- Russian collusion, Mueller obstruction, tax abuse and Stormy Daniels. Now they expect voters to spend the next year living with them in Ukrainia. There has to be a limit, and this may be it.

Texto completo: "Are you talking to me?" President Trump asked, his brow creased in disgust.
He was staring at Jeff Mason, a Reuters reporter whom Mr. Trump had called on moments earlier during an East Room news conference with the president of Finland.
Such events, with the American president joined by a fellow head of state, are usually formal affairs. But Mr. Trump seemed to be in a stormy mood on Wednesday, lashing out on Twitter and in person at his enemies, real and perceived, as House Democrats pursue a formal impeachment inquiry against him.
One regular Trump boogeyman -- the American news media -- has come in for particular ire of late. Mr. Trump has tweaked his usual "fake news" sobriquet, now preferring the term "corrupt news." Earlier on Wednesday, in the Oval Office, he attacked the credibility of The Washington Post over an article that outlined his interest in constructing an alligator- and snake-filled moat along the southern border. Mr. Trump appeared unaware that the article had been published by The New York Times.
Then came the exchange with Mr. Mason, which was emblematic of the president's escalating attacks on the press.
Mr. Mason, a veteran White House correspondent, had posed a straightforward question: What did the president hope to achieve when he asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the Biden family's dealings in his country?
Mr. Trump's discursive reply ranged from his gripes about financial support for Europe to a shout-out to Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and included a comparison of Ukraine to "a wall between Russia and Europe -- a big, wide, beautiful wall." The substance of Mr. Mason's question went unanswered, so the Reuters reporter tried again.
"The question, sir," Mr. Mason said, "was what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?"
Polite but persistent follow-ups are a White House correspondent's stock in trade. But Mr. Trump expressed deep offense, interrupting Mr. Mason and instructing him to ask the Finnish president a question instead.
"Did you hear me? Did you hear me?" Mr. Trump said from his lectern. "Ask him a question. I've given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don't be rude."
"I don't want to be rude," Mr. Mason replied. "I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you."
Again, Mr. Trump deflected -- this time with a verbal fusillade against journalists. "I've answered everything," the president said. (He hadn't.) "It's a whole hoax, and you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country -- and, I say in many cases, the corrupt media, because you're corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it's corrupt."
Mr. Mason seems to have a knack for standing out at Finland-related events: Last year, he drew attention for a series of tough questions to Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during their summit in Helsinki.
His calm on Wednesday won praise from fellow journalists. "Jeff Mason is a total pro," a Washington Post reporter, Michael Scherer, wrote on Twitter. "That was textbook. Play the tape in journalism schools."
Even after he moved on from Mr. Mason, Mr. Trump returned to his acid commentary on the press. "If the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation," he said in closing.
Mr. Trump's slashing criticism of the media has been denounced by news outlets and press advocates, in particular for the ways that autocrats around the world have invoked his remarks to justify cracking down on independent journalists. Almost uniformly before Mr. Trump, American presidents publicly promoted the role of journalism in a democracy, even if they groused over tough coverage.
In his recent fury, Mr. Trump has also pressed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable discourse in journalism. On Wednesday, the president fired off a tweet that included a profane word for manure, rendered in all capital letters. Soon after, Richard Davis, CNN's head of standards, circulated a memo at the network noting that its journalists should feel free to use the word "in graphics, banners and headlines."
"It is newsworthy that he wrote it and tweeted it out, and we should show and say it because the president sent it out just that way," Mr. Davis wrote, according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Times.

Texto completo: RENO, Nev. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to President Trump's attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of "lies, smears, distortions and name calling" geared at knocking him out of the presidential race.
Mr. Biden made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute unsubstantiated claims by the president and his personal lawyer that Mr. Biden improperly assisted his son's business ventures in Ukraine and China.
The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump "hijack" his campaign by allowing the president's narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire -- unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north.
In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the widening impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens -- and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender.
"Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I'm not going anywhere," Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here.
"You're not going to destroy me," he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing "Impeach 45" jerseys. "And you're not going to destroy my family. I don't care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get."
The American people, Mr. Biden said, "know me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's credibility is a joke."
Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and jokingly pretended to mispronounce the last name of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump's behalf.
He said there was "zero, zero, zero" evidence that his family had done anything wrong.
Mr. Biden's increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states.
A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey's margin of error.
At Wednesday night's rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.
"A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump," he said. "I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum."
Mr. Biden's team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump's supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly -- despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim.
And Mr. Biden's top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media's willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.
The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption.
On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading "debunked conspiracy theories."
Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump's statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous "abuse of power" that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort.
Mr. Trump, he said, is "afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November."
The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree.
"I'd rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates," Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.

'It's a whole hoax': Trump unloads his fury as whistleblower questions snowball

Texto completo: First came the diplomacy, the gentle celebration in the grand White House East Room of close ties with Finland in honor of the day’s guest. Then came the questions about the whistleblower, impeachment proceedings, and subpoenas.
“It’s a whole hoax, and you know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media,” said President Trump, voice raised as he tried to shut down the freewheeling press conference. “And I say in many cases the corrupt media, because you’re corrupt.”
He paused and pointed to his guest, who had stood silently beside him for almost 15 minutes.
“Ask the president of Finland a question,” he said, before wading in to answer the next question on free trade himself.
It marked a stark contrast to his most recent press conference, a muted affair on the fringes of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week. Then Trump cut a sober figure as he rounded off an exhausting three days of meetings and speeches.
But the whistleblower story has not gone away, and this time he deployed his full range of emotions, from weary resignation to righteous indignation, and then red-faced fury. For 40 blistering minutes, he threatened legal action against his accusers, dismissed the Bidens as “stone cold crooked,” and vented against reporters who wanted their questions answered.
He cast allegations that he sought foreign help in collecting dirt on Joe Biden as nothing but the latest in a plot to discredit him that began with the Mueller investigation.
"I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corruption investigation having to do with the 2016 election," he said.
He did not elaborate, but his administration is currently investigating the origins of the Mueller investigation.
Minutes later the president had a chance to gloat. He was asked about a breaking story in the New York Times claiming that the whistleblower at the heart of the probe had discussed his complaint with a congressional aide who then passed on the details to Adam Schiff, the committee chairman now leading the House of Representatives' impeachment investigation
“I love that question. It shows that Schiff is a fraud,” said Trump. “I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further: I think he probably helped write it.”
Beside him, Sauli Niinistö lowered his eyes, looking for all the world as if he was wishing he had asked to stand behind a bigger lectern.
The press conference was merely the latest chance for Trump to go on the offensive.
“The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016,” he tweeted as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schiff addressed reporters on Capitol Hill.
Half an hour later, Niinistö sat beside him in the Oval Office as he continued his verbal assault on “shifty Schiff,” ending by suggesting he was not fit to carry an intimate piece of Mike Pompeo’s sporting apparel.
“You know there’s an expression: He couldn’t carry his ‘blank’ strap,” said Trump. “I won’t say it because they’ll say it was so terrible.”
One of the observers present described Trump as “effusive” and “feisty.”
He carried that mindset into the East Room later in the afternoon, keeping up the attacks on a “hoax” against the American people. In particular, he targeted Schiff for his performance in Congress last week when he paraphrased and satirically embellished the White House account of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president.
“He should resign,” Trump said. “Some people are even saying it was treason.”
And he did not miss a high-volume opportunity to re-raise questions about what exactly Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, was doing for a Ukrainian energy company. Even though there is no specific evidence of anything untoward, he knows how to keep one half of the audience focused on his Democratic opponent.
“Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,” he said. “You know it. The son walked out with millions of dollars and the kid knows nothing.”
Lost in the mix was the other news: An endorsement of the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia as a provider of 5G infrastructure, an agreement to protect the Arctic, and an announcement that Finland would be returning antiquities and burial remains taken from Mesa Verde in the 19th century.
Isn’t it wearying, asked a member of the Finnish press corps, to deal with the nonstop controversy?
“I’m used to it,” answered Trump. “It’s like putting on a suit in the morning.”

Texto completo: Andrew Howard, a 20-year-old student at Arizona State University, broke international news in the State Press on Friday night.
Then he finished his shift as an intern at The Arizona Republic, went home, woke up Saturday and fielded calls from the New York Times, the Washington Post and other major news outlets. Sunday he did more interviews, finished a six-page paper due in his politics class and Monday woke up at 3 a.m. so he could appear on the MSNBC show "Morning Joe." Then he slept a little and went to his data journalism class.
And how was your weekend?
"It's been crazy," said Howard, a managing editor for the student-run State Press. "I mean really, it's been sort of absurd. I've been interviewed by outlets I never imagined."
Howard broke the story Friday on Kurt Volker resigning as the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine after reports that President Donald Trump had asked Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running as a Democratic candidate for president, hoping to unseat Trump in 2020.
Volker is the executive director of the McCain Institute at ASU. Howard pursued the story through that angle, and wound up beating everyone.
He's part of a team of interns at The Republic All this while working on an advance obituary during his shift at The Arizona Republic. The internship program allows students to work as actual journalists in the newsroom — something Howard, as he suggests, was doing when the story published, which gave him pause."I sort of looked over and said (to his editor), 'Sorry about that, that was me, that's my bad.' It was funny. I was just sitting in there and that story with my name on it broke."
All is forgiven.
Howard knew he had a good story. He just wasn't sure how big.
"We knew we had the scoop," he said. "I'm not sure we ever thought that the reaction would be as big as it was that we broke the news. None of us expected that."
'It's just so exciting for a young journalist' He has been pleasantly surprised at the reaction from the media he scooped — the request by a couple of outlets to pass along his source notwithstanding.
"Everyone seems to be happy about it," he said. "No one's said a single bad thing about us breaking the story and some other newsroom didn't. It's been really motivating that people have been so supportive of us. As a student newsroom, it's great to feel like you're supported by the media and not an outlier just because we're students."
Why not? It's a great story about a great story. And pretty unique, too.
"I am in my 12th year here at ASU and I don't remember another story like this, in terms of importance and worldwide response," said Jason Manning, director of student media and an adviser to the State Press. "One fairly recent story that received national attention was the university's investigation into alleged misconduct by Professor Lawrence Krauss. The State Press led out on certain aspects of that story and received well-deserved recognition, but the response to the Volker story has been unique in its scope and intensity."
What comes next Like any good journalist, Howard is busily working on following the story. That, coupled with a crazy weekend, has prevented him from fully grasping the enormity of it all.
"Even though it's Monday, I think tomorrow might be the first day where I can sit down and process everything that happened," he said.
That said, these are still heady times.
"I've been talking about it 24/7," Howard said, laughing. "I bet all my friends hate me. I can't not talk about it. It's just so exciting for a young journalist. I don't think it's going to be easy for me to try and forget that I was in the New York Times this weekend."

'Too nice' Booker may be the ticket

Texto completo: One question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as their standard-bearer for 2020: "Can they beat Donald Trump?"
One person who thus far has not been deemed up to the task by prospective voters is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who has been languishing deep in the second tier of candidates in national polls. So dire was the situation that his campaign put out a memo a little over a week ago warning that if it didn't raise $1.7 million by the end of September, Booker would be forced to drop out of the race. His supporters rallied, and on Monday his campaign announced he had reached its target.
Booker has been dogged by concerns that his message of love and togetherness might not be right for the times. The New York Times summed it up in a headline: "Is Cory Booker too nice? (And is that bad?)"
But Booker believes strongly that his approach is the winning way.
In a recent interview, Booker told me that "grace and decency is the way to beat Trump. You can't beat him using his tactics, fighting him on his turf." Put another way: Never wrestle with a pig. The pig likes it, and you get dirty.
What we need is to have "a revival of civic grace, to have a more courageous empathy, to get back to understanding that we share a common cause and common purpose, and most certainly share a common destiny," Booker said. He lamented that Americans are "falling into tribalism in this country where we hate each other so much."
On some level, we all know this is true. Yet to many Americans, this kind of talk sounds weak. This is because we have a real misunderstanding about what strength is in politics.
There is "this sort of toxic masculinity that is this idea that to be strong, you have to be an ass," the senator noted. "The antidote to this moment and time is not more Trumpiness. That's why I constantly remind people that love is not weak. Do not confuse strength with meanness. Do not confuse being tough with being cruel. In fact, they are opposites."
Of Trump and Biden
Still, grace for your political enemies feels unnatural, even wrong. It's a posture that takes a lot of work to achieve.
Booker himself admitted on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" in July that he sometimes feels like punching Trump. Many of us know that feeling, so Booker is in no way suggesting that anyone stop hating what Trump is doing to the country. He's not suggesting we have to be perfect and never utter a bad word about Trump or his allies. He's just outlining an approach to beating Trump that sounds counterintuitive in the era of clapbacks and cancel culture.
It also doesn't mean that Booker can never criticize his Democratic opponents. When Booker pointed out after the last debate that some people were concerned former Vice President Joe Biden might fumble the ball if he became the nominee, many commentators said he was off brand. But that's because our culture is confused about what grace looks like. Grace does not ask you to be a doormat or have no opinions or never criticize. Loving people does not require you to stay silent when you see something that merits being called out. Certainly, Booker's concerns about Biden deserved to be heard and considered.
When I presented Booker with the disturbing math I've heard from too many Democrats behind the scenes that it will take a white man to beat Trump, he replied, "This idea that we need a safe candidate that we may not all be excited about, but he's the safe choice, is so contrary to our self-interest." He added, "And by the way, you make a big mistake if during the campaign the person says something that's racially offensive. That steps in it. And that's why, as a lot of people have written after the last debate, please, Joe Biden, clarify what you were saying about black parents. Please give the guy a chance to clarify because what he said was offensive to black people."
Hear him out
This pointed criticism of Biden's response to a question of how to repair the legacy of slavery is certainly within bounds. A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren't actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump's relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another. Trump does this because he cannot survive in an ordered universe free of hatred and chaos, so he works overtime to create disorder. His best hope is that Democrats will sink into the mud with him so that voters will ultimately tune out in disgust, leaving only the most hardened partisans showing up to vote.
Cory Booker gets this. Whether he will break through with his message and vision remains to be seen. But he deserves a real hearing.

Escalation From Beijing on Its National Day

Texto completo: Hong Kong -- President Xi Jinping wanted Tuesday -- Beijing's National Day -- to be a celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist China. Instead, it marked an escalation in violence against Hong Kong. For the first time, police fired a live round at a protester, an 18-year-old student, who suffered a chest wound.
National Day had loomed for months as a potential milestone for the protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong since June. Authorities wanted to quell the unrest before Oct. 1, while protesters strove to keep it alive until then -- and they prevailed. Tuesday's shooting will invigorate the protests, and Beijing has no obvious solution to this political crisis.
In a video address Tuesday night, a police spokeswoman claimed that protesters had attacked officers, one of whom fired "to save his own life and his colleagues' lives." She added: "The police do not wish to see anyone injured in the incident. It is really heart-breaking."
Hong Kongers don't buy it. They believe only international pressure has prevented a massacre. They were especially heartened when President Trump told reporters in August that "it would be very hard to deal" with Beijing "if it's another Tiananmen Square" in Hong Kong. Wong Chun Wing, 20, told me he first regarded Mr. Trump as crazy but has come to respect him because he stands up for human rights and challenges China. Mr. Wong doesn't believe Hillary Clinton would have taken such a hard line. Protesters now carry American flags as "a way to say thank you," he said.
Emboldened by international support, Hong Kongers say they will quit the streets only if the government meets their "five demands, not one less," as the rallying cry goes. Beijing is afraid of conceding too much, lest mainland Chinese learn that demonstrations and disorder yield results.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam acquiesced to one demand last month, agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the large-scale protests in June. "That invited a lot of criticism in China," said Fu King Wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking online discussion in the mainland. "They take withdrawal of the bill as a major concession" and question why the government would "back down" in response "to a rioter who created violence."
It would be even harder for Beijing to accede to the protesters' remaining four demands -- for free elections, an independent inquiry into police violence, official acknowledgment that the protests aren't riots, and amnesty for those who've been arrested. Instead authorities are working to discredit the protesters. While the vast majority have been peaceful, a minority have brawled with cops, thrown Molotov cocktails or bricks, started fires, and damaged property. Ms. Lam argues that giving them amnesty would "run counter to rule of law."
Following the lead of their mainland counterparts, Hong Kong authorities are also attempting to buy legitimacy with material blandishments. In August Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a US$2.4 billion spending package, which includes numerous handouts. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Ms. Lam promised "bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing," along with "numerous major projects and initiatives . . . that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come."
In another effort at appeasement, Ms. Lam launched a series of "community dialogue sessions," where the public can vent concerns. Some in Hong Kong have speculated that without directly addressing protesters' demands, she may also establish commissions to explore how Hong Kong can reform its police department or gradually work toward a more representative government. But no one braves water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas for listening sessions or the dithering of bureaucrats. And dialogue, like a commission or special report, sets the expectation that the government will eventually address Hong Kongers' concerns. A disappointing outcome would only exacerbate the public discontent.
Beijing and its pawns in the Hong Kong government have tried to intimidate protesters with nonlethal force and wait until their energy runs out. That strategy has failed, and Tuesday's violence will add to the protesters' momentum. Against all odds, Hong Kongers succeeded in defeating the extradition bill that presented an immediate threat to their autonomy, calling global attention to Beijing's abuses of power, and leaving Beijing with no good way to end an embarrassing spectacle.
The greatest threat to their success may be the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal. If Mr. Trump succeeds in striking one, he may be less eager to take Beijing to task over Hong Kong. The risk for protesters is that the world will lose interest in the confrontation, emboldening Beijing.

Texto completo: 1 Nutrition studies often are not rigorously scientific
The majority of nutrition studies are observational--in the case of red meat, they asked if meat-eaters were less healthy, and if those who ate more were also less healthy than those who ate less.
But it's extremely difficult to know what someone is eating;many study participants struggle to remember and accurately report their diets.And meat-eaters
may differ from those who don't eat meat, or eat less, in a variety of ways that also influence health.
Researchers try to correct for those variations, but the statistical analyses are difficult and, many experts say, not particularly reliable in a system as complex as human nutrition.
Even in the best of circumstances, observational studies do not prove cause and effect; they only suggest correlations.But policymakers often rely on this data when devising guidelines.
2 Studies do turn up small health benefits from eating less meat Here are some of the outcomes cited by the authors of the new research: If people were to reduce meat consumption by three servings a week, there might be one to six fewer heart attacks per 1,000 people.But there would be no effect on deaths resulting from heart disease or any cause overall. For cancer, the group reports that decreasing meat consumption by three servings a week might result in seven fewer cancer deaths per 1,000 people. But there would be no effect on the risk of getting breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic or prostate cancer.
3 But what does that mean for you personally?
Frank Hu, professor and chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in an email:
"These risk reductions are not small from a public health point of view and could save hundreds and thousands of lives in the U.S.,because of the high prevalence of people consuming diets high in red and processed meats.Few dietary or lifestyle changes or even a drug could have multiple health benefits on major causes of deaths."
But Dr.Dennis Bier of Baylor said the studies of meat consumption are so flawed that it is naïve to assume these risk reductions are caused by eating less meat.
"The rules of scientific proof are the same for physics as for nutrition," he said in a telephone interview.But unlike experiments in physics, where investigators can control variables and determine causality, in nutrition "you can't conduct the experiment."
4 Major medical organizations are sticking to their dietary recommendations
The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, among others, immediately released statements reiterating their advice to eat less red meat for better health.
5 We're all going to have to live with some uncertainty "The guidelines are based on papers that presumably say there is evidence for what they say.And there isn't.That's the history of nutrition,"said Bier.
Dr.David Allison, dean of the Indiana University School of Public Health-- Bloomington, said there is a difference "between evidence for drawing a scientific conclusion, and making or recommending an action."
"The standards of evidence for the former are scientific matters and should not depend on extra scientific considerations"he added. "The standards of evidence for the latter are matters of personal judgment or in some cases legislation."
His advice: "People should be aware of the uncertainty and make their decisions based on that awareness."

Texto completo: Readers make comparisons to previous efforts to impeach presidents. Also: The Trump whistle-blower; sex abuse of military men.
To the Editor:
Re "Why a Trump Impeachment Should Terrify You," by Frank Bruni (column, nytimes.com, Sept. 25):
I'm not afraid of what happens if we impeach President Trump. I'm afraid of what happens if we don't.
Right now, the standard for impeachment is quite low, as it should be. Three presidents have faced impeachment in the past, all for what I would consider relatively small crimes measured against what we are seeing today.
Andrew Johnson violated a federal act by removing an official. Richard Nixon tried to stifle the investigation of a burglary. Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury. As Representative Barbara Jordan brilliantly argued in her Watergate speech, the only question we need to ask of impeachment is if the president violated the public trust.
Mr. Trump far exceeds this standard. He lies constantly and may have broken numerous laws regarding corruption, extortion, campaign finance, bribery, collusion, conspiracy and obstruction.
If Mr. Trump is not impeached, the bar for impeachment will be raised to such heights that it will cease to be a functional part of the Constitution. Congress will lose its co-equal status and serve at the behest of a vastly more powerful executive branch. Our republic is on a knife's edge. Indeed, as Nancy Pelosi said, quoting Thomas Paine, "The times have found us."

To the Editor:
Re "What's Different Now" (news analysis, front page, Sept. 25):
Carl Hulse writes that "Republicans paid a steep political price in the midterm elections for moving to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998." Although this thought is often heard, it is badly misleading.
In the midterm elections of 1998, following the impeachment of President Clinton by the House, Republicans did lose five House seats to the Democrats, but they retained control of the House. In the Senate the Republicans maintained their majority. Most important, the Republicans went on to win the White House in the next two elections.
One must conclude that it cost Republicans very little to attempt to remove from office even a president as widely popular as Bill Clinton. Today, since Mr. Trump's approval rating is around 43 percent, the Democrats stand to lose more from not impeaching him than from letting him slide. Perhaps they have now realized this.

Trump's Desire to Meet His Accuser
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Seeks Whistle-Blower's Identity" (nytimes.com, Sept. 30):
So President Trump says he wants to "meet my accuser." That's a first.
Does he realize how foolish he sounds now, having spent his life avoiding all the women who have accused him of crimes, and all the Trump University victims who have wanted to confront him and all the small contractors who were stiffed by him?
"Meet my accuser"? Just step outside any of your rallies, Mr. Trump!

When Men Are Sexually Abused in the Military
To the Editor:
Re "Men Tell Their Stories of Rape in the Service" (news article, Sept. 12):
As trauma psychologists, we thank you for shining a spotlight on the high prevalence of sexual assault of men in the military and the incredible pain associated with it.
For too long, this experience has been denied or minimized. The sexual violation of boys and men is a much bigger public health problem than previously realized. Indeed, at least one in six men is sexually abused before his 18th birthday, and this number rises to one in four across a man's life span.
The negative mental health consequences from such terrifying violations include post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior. The effects don't stop there.
Many men live with related impairments in their relationships, finding it hard to trust or feel safe in communion with others. They largely live in silence, fearing that if they tell someone, all the negative things they think about themselves will be confirmed.
Our group at Yale is conducting a national study trying to help male sexual abuse survivors get the help they need. Healing from sexual trauma is possible, and even probable, with evidence-informed interventions.

Texto completo: Weeks after the city's Board of Supervisors declared the National Rifle Association a terrorist organization, the mayor clarifies that the resolution will not change city policy.
The city of San Francisco is pulling back from its face-off with the National Rifle Association, weeks after its Board of Supervisors declared the group a domestic terrorist organization. But the N.R.A. said it is not yet prepared to drop a lawsuit it filed against the city in response.
A resolution the board approved on Sept. 3 called for the city's agencies to limit their relationships with companies that do business with the N.R.A. But Mayor London Breed said in a memo on Sept. 23 that the resolution was not binding, and that it would not change the practices of city agencies. The existence of the memo was previously reported by The San Francisco Examiner.
The mayor's move came two weeks after the N.R.A. filed suit against San Francisco, alleging that the city had violated the organization's First Amendment right to free speech and was effectively moving to "blacklist anyone linked to the N.R.A."
In the memo, the mayor and the city attorney, Dennis Herrera, wrote, "The city's contracting process and policies have not changed and will not change as a result of the resolution." The notice was circulated to the heads of all city departments.
"There is an epidemic of gun violence plaguing our country, and we need to hold organizations like the N.R.A. accountable for their obstruction to real reforms to make our communities safer," Ms. Breed said in a statement on Tuesday. "While this nonbinding resolution has no force of law behind it, this doesn't take away from the fact that the N.R.A. continues to shamefully stand in the way of every single piece of gun control legislation."
John Coté, a spokesman for Mr. Herrera, said the Sept. 23 memo was "not a concession," adding: "It just explains what has always been true -- the resolution does not change the law. If the N.R.A. thinks this is a win, it's only because their lawsuit completely distorts what the resolution actually does."
William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the N.R.A., said that city officials "wisely have attempted to pull back from what we alleged, the association alleged, was a clear violation of the association's First Amendment rights."
But the group is not ready to drop its litigation.
"What we hope is that the Board of Supervisors will further mitigate the damage they've done," he said, adding that the organization would like to see the board rescind or repeal the resolution, "or walk away from it in some binding way."
The group considered San Francisco's original declaration part of a series of actions against it by Democratic leaders in the wake of several mass shootings. The Board of Supervisors passed the resolution two days after three people were killed and 13 injured in a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif.
"I knew all along that this was a nonbinding resolution," Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who introduced the measure, said in a statement on Tuesday. "We made our point: The N.R.A. is a terrorist organization. I will keep fighting them using every tool at my disposal."
For now, the group is declaring victory.
"Through these actions and our public advocacy, we hope the message is now clear," Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s chief executive, said on its website on Tuesday. "The N.R.A. will always fight to protect our members and the constitutional freedoms in which they believe."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A book excerpt published Tuesday describes a turbulent week inside the Trump administration in March as the president ordered staff to shut down the United States' 2,000-mile border with Mexico.
According to reporting from the New York Times, President Donald Trump had at times privately talked about “fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. ”
Additionally, after aides told him that his public suggestion of soldiers shooting migrants if they threw rocks was illegal, he backed down. But, he later suggested that they “shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. ”
"That’s not allowed either, (staff) told him," according to the excerpt.
The article published Tuesday was adapted from “Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,” a book to be published on Oct. 8 by Times reporters Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
The article is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House administration officials who were granted anonymity, describing a "frenzied week of presidential rages" that included "around-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time," according to the Times.
Adding profanity, Trump shouted, "You are making me look like an idiot! I ran on this. It's my issue,” during a meeting that included White House Aide Stephen Miller, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then-Customs and Border Protection chief Kevin McAleenan, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as well as presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to the book excerpt.
The comments came around the same time the President publicly threatened to close the border, saying he would if “Mexico doesn’t get with it. " Trump later backed off from that threat.
“The president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,” Thomas D. Homan, who served as Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Times. “The president wanted it to be fixed quickly. ’’
The book excerpt includes details that Trump “routinely berated” Nielsen as “ineffective and, worse — at least in his mind — not tough-looking enough. "
During a briefing over the necessity for new legal authority to bring down drones, Trump reportedly told Nielsen that she “didn’t hear me the first time, honey. Shoot ’em down. Sweetheart, just shoot ’em out of the sky, OK?”
“The happiest [Trump] had been with [DHS Secretary] Nielsen was a few months earlier, when American border agents had fired tear gas into Mexico to try to stop migrants from crossing into the United States," the Times reported.
The cruelty has always been the point. https://t. co/DUSNwFR6W4
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 1, 2019
Democrats were quick to express their outrage after the excerpt published.
Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez said that “cruelty has always been the point,” with the president. Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted that Trump’s actions usually fall “into one of three buckets: cruel, childish, or corrupt. ”

Ruchir Sharma: Why Wall Street loves strongmen

Texto completo: Wall Street has long existed as a parallel universe where leaders cast by critics in the media as autocratic villains can be feted as heroes if their actions bode well for the economy. Lately, this split has reached new extremes.
In the critics’ view, we live in an increasingly illiberal age, populated by dangerously erratic strongmen. Leading examples include President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who at the United Nations this week defiantly defended his government against charges that it is turning a blind eye as the Amazon burns; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose tough, military-backed regime has been the target of protests over the past week; and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, widely reviled for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives.
Yet global investors view the same trio as promising economic reformers, following a mainstream playbook that could have been written (indeed sometimes is written) by analysts at the International Monetary Fund. Markets reward them accordingly. For much of their recent tenures, Brazil under Mr. Bolsonaro and Saudi Arabia under Prince Mohammed have all ranked among the world’s hottest stock markets. Until this week, this year’s top-performing market was Egypt.
The harsh reality is that markets are amoral, instinctively neutral barometers of economic performance, and they will at times ignore the brutality and excesses of strongmen for a simple reason: Facing little or no resistance from legislatures, courts or independent watchdogs, strongmen can push through sweeping reforms — particularly in emerging economies, where political institutions and the rule of law are relatively weak. Looking at the records for 150 countries between 1950 and 2010, I found 43 cases in which an economy grew at an annual pace of 7 percent or more for a full decade. An astonishing 35 of those economies — more than 80 percent of them — were run by an autocrat.
The downside is that nations subject to the unchecked whims of autocrats are also vulnerable to wild growth swings — and long slumps. Among the same 150 countries, I found 138 cases in which an economy grew at a pace of 3 percent or slower for a decade, and 100 of those economies were led by an autocrat.
Markets sense the erratic nature of economies run by strongmen and will bet big on these figures until the moment economic reforms lose momentum. Stock markets enjoyed bull runs under autocrats who instituted high-growth policies, like Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Suharto of Indonesia and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
After 2000 a new generation of autocratic market darlings arose, led by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. In their first terms, the stock markets of Russia and Turkey rose, respectively, by about 100 percentage points and 300 percentage points faster than the average for emerging countries. Later, investors would turn on Russia and Turkey, not because their leaders grew more troublesomely autocratic but because they stopped pushing tough economic reforms.
What markets look for perhaps above all is financial stability, a necessary condition for solid growth. Today, while there are many differences among Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, they have each taken steps to put their financial houses in order.
Mr. Bolsonaro plans to downsize the bureaucracy, sell off state companies and cut up to $250 billion from pension payments that could bankrupt Brazil. Mr. el-Sisi, in part to secure I.M.F. help, has raised taxes on capital gains and on the rich, and slashed fuel subsidies by more than 50 percent. Prince Mohammed has cracked down on rich tax dodgers, including fellow Saudi royals, raised sales taxes and cut energy subsidies as a way to pare back a large budget deficit.
Wall Street research reports on Brazil, Egypt and Saudi Arabia barely mention autocratic tendencies. Instead, they say that reforms are “still on track” in Saudi Arabia, Egypt is “the best reform story” in its region, and “market considers Bolsonaro Brazil’s ‘last chance’ to reform economy.” The gap between market and mainstream media narratives is now a yawning chasm.
In May, Mr. Bolsonaro was driven out of Manhattan by headline-grabbing demonstrators chanting “fascista,” shortly after his University of Chicago-educated economic minister, Paulo Guedes, was greeted as a savior by global investors at the I.M.F.’s semiannual meeting in Washington. One participant (a Wall Street liberal) told me Mr. Guedes’s speech, outlining Mr. Bolsonaro’s free-market plans, was “the most inspiring” she had ever heard at this confab.
One trait the new strongmen share is a tendency to blur ideological lines. Illiberal politics often combine with eclectic economics in ways that make them hard to place on the traditional left-right political spectrum. President Trump, a champion of blue-collar jobs and tax cuts for the rich, is a prominent example. More than any other American president, he has tried to please the stock market. And as the impeachment battles heat up, he is likely to try to please it more, in his erratic way — perhaps by looking for a quick trade deal with China or further badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
Not coincidentally, Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, who occupy the same gray area. The crown prince has freed women to drive as part of an economic modernization campaign while suppressing activists who push for broader women’s rights. Is he right or left, progressive or reactionary, or beyond the old categories?
It is not that people on Wall Street themselves are amoral or aren’t often appalled by the excesses of autocrats. But it is their job to filter out headlines casting strongman presidents and prime ministers as cruel villains, and focus instead on whether their policies are likely to spur growth.
With illiberal leaders still on the rise worldwide, this political age is likely to produce more strongmen the market can love.

Texto completo: Hong Kong
President Xi Jinping wanted Tuesday—Beijing's National Day—to be a celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist China. Instead, it marked an escalation in violence against Hong Kong. For the first time, police fired a live round at a protester, an 18-year-old student, who suffered a chest wound.
National Day had loomed for months as a potential milestone for the protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong since June. Authorities wanted to quell the unrest before Oct. 1, while protesters strove to keep it alive until then—and they prevailed. Tuesday's shooting will invigorate the protests, and Beijing has no obvious solution to this political crisis.
In a video address Tuesday night, a police spokeswoman claimed that protesters had attacked officers, one of whom fired "to save his own life and his colleagues' lives." She added: "The police do not wish to see anyone injured in the incident. It is really heart-breaking."
Hong Kongers don't buy it. They believe only international pressure has prevented a massacre. They were especially heartened when President Trump told reporters in August that "it would be very hard to deal" with Beijing "if it's another Tiananmen Square" in Hong Kong. Wong Chun Wing, 20, told me he first regarded Mr. Trump as crazy but has come to respect him because he stands up for human rights and challenges China. Mr. Wong doesn't believe Hillary Clinton would have taken such a hard line. Protesters now carry American flags as "a way to say thank you," he said.
Emboldened by international support, Hong Kongers say they will quit the streets only if the government meets their "five demands, not one less," as the rallying cry goes. Beijing is afraid of conceding too much, lest mainland Chinese learn that demonstrations and disorder yield results.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam acquiesced to one demand last month, agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the large-scale protests in June. "That invited a lot of criticism in China," said Fu King Wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking online discussion in the mainland. "They take withdrawal of the bill as a major concession" and question why the government would "back down" in response "to a rioter who created violence."
It would be even harder for Beijing to accede to the protesters' remaining four demands—for free elections, an independent inquiry into police violence, official acknowledgment that the protests aren't riots, and amnesty for those who've been arrested. Instead authorities are working to discredit the protesters. While the vast majority have been peaceful, a minority have brawled with cops, thrown Molotov cocktails or bricks, started fires, and damaged property. Mrs. Lam argues that giving them amnesty would "run counter to rule of law."
Following the lead of their mainland counterparts, Hong Kong authorities are also attempting to buy legitimacy with material blandishments. In August Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a US$2.4 billion spending package, which includes numerous handouts. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Mrs. Lam promised "bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing," along with "numerous major projects and initiatives . . . that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come."
In another effort at appeasement, Mrs. Lam launched a series of "community dialogue sessions," where the public can vent concerns. Some in Hong Kong have speculated that without directly addressing protesters' demands, she may also establish commissions to explore how Hong Kong can reform its police department or gradually work toward a more representative government. But no one braves water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas for listening sessions or the dithering of bureaucrats. And dialogue, like a commission or special report, sets the expectation that the government will eventually address Hong Kongers' concerns. A disappointing outcome would only exacerbate the public discontent.
Beijing and its pawns in the Hong Kong government have tried to intimidate protesters with nonlethal force and wait until their energy runs out. That strategy has failed, and Tuesday's violence will add to the protesters' momentum. Against all odds, Hong Kongers succeeded in defeating the extradition bill that presented an immediate threat to their autonomy, calling global attention to Beijing's abuses of power, and leaving Beijing with no good way to end an embarrassing spectacle.
The greatest threat to their success may be the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal. If Mr. Trump succeeds in striking one, he may be less eager to take Beijing to task over Hong Kong. The risk for protesters is that the world will lose interest in the confrontation, emboldening Beijing.

Trump, China and an Unhappy Birthday; Let's hope the President gets something in return for pretending Xi Jinping is a good guy.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is rarely criticized for being too nice on Twitter. But who can support his oddly cheerful conduct of foreign social-media relations on Tuesday morning? Mr. Trump wished a happy birthday to China's communist government, currently celebrating seven decades of suppressing liberty. Americans must hope this is merely the start of the deal on trade and not a policy statement on freedom in Asia.
"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!," tweeted America's duly elected president to the regime that has never held a free election.
Ken Meyer at Mediaite writes :
While Trump may think that his tweet will lead to some positive effect on the trade war between the U.S. and China, the fact remains that the president just bid his compliments to a communist regime that committed numerous atrocities and human rights abuses against its own people for decades. Trump's tweet also comes just hours after the news broke that a Hong Kong police officer shot a protester for the first time since demonstrations began against China's tightening of control over the territory.
Someone named Benjamin Fearnow writes in Newsweek:
Liberal journalist David Corn joined dozens of members of the media who immediately pounced on the president's words of encouragement to the Chinese Communist Party he frequently ridicules during trade war talks. "Go gangster communism!!!" he responded.
As if communism needs a modifier to emphasize its criminality. By some estimates Chinese communism has killed an average of nearly a million people each year the regime has been in power. Fortunately the pace has dramatically slowed and economic freedom has massively increased since the government's Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s and early 1960s killed some 45 million people . Soon after, the Cultural Revolution killed perhaps a million more. A move toward economic freedom beginning in the 1970s has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
But freedom has declined since Mr. Xi came to power in 2012. Ominously, he has venerated the regime's founder and author of its murderous early decades, Mao Zedong. This has been a surprise to some who hoped Mr. Xi might be something of a reformer, given that his own father had been purged from a leadership role in the Mao era and spent years in the wilderness. As Mr. Xi was ascending to the top of the Chinese dictatorship in 2012, Andrew Higgins wrote in the Washington Post about the father:
...Xi senior is particularly popular with many liberals, who remember him as unusually open-minded and tolerant — and hope that his son, under a carapace of political rectitude, is perhaps similar.
Not everyone had high hopes, as Mr. Higgins reported at the time:
Frank Dikotter, a Dutch scholar who is working on a book on the party's early years in power, urged caution in viewing Xi's father as a "great moderate." Archive material records him demanding an "active attack" against Christian churches. He never questioned one-party rule. But, said Dikotter, he does seem to have been broader-minded than the norm and "doesn't come across as a big mister nasty" who saw violence as a solution.
Given the carnage of China's revolutionary era, one had to be extremely nasty to stand out from the other commies. As for the current Mr. Xi, he hasn't been a sweetheart when it comes to human rights. Stuart Lau reports in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post on one resident of the People's Republic who is currently serving a life sentence:
Jailed Uygur academic Ilham Tohti has been awarded one of Europe's top human rights prizes, as Beijing comes under pressure over its treatment of the predominantly Muslim population in its far western Xinjiang region.
...More than a million ethnic Uygurs and members of other largely Muslim ethnic groups are believed to have been detained in extrajudicial internment camps in Xinjiang in a crackdown that began in early 2017. The camps have prompted an international outcry, but the government says they are vocational training centres and part of an effort to combat terrorism.
There have been reports of torture and forced labour at the camps, and some members of the Uygur diaspora in Turkey have also complained of forced family separation in Xinjiang, with children ordered to go to boarding schools.
Meanwhile Chris Buckley reports in the New York Times that on a recent visit to Xinyang, China, Mr. Xi honored a memorial to communist fighters from the Mao era. But official accounts made no mention of the vastly larger number of peasants in the area who were starved to death by the regime. Notes Mr. Buckley:
In his seven years in power, Mr. Xi has acted on the belief that to control China he must control its history. His administration has molded textbooks, television shows, movies and museums to match his narrative of national unity and rejuvenation under iron party rule...
Exposing the party's historical setbacks has become increasingly unwelcome under Mr. Xi... He warned officials in 2013 to take heed of the unraveling of the Soviet Union, when liberal historians dismantled its revolutionary heritage.
"Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse?" Mr. Xi said. One important reason, he said, was that its leaders had allowed Stalin, Lenin and Soviet history to be denigrated.
"There's a lesson in that for us," Mr. Xi said.
For Mr. Trump, it's a lesson not to expect too much in the way of reform from China's dictator.

A Simple Regimen Can Prevent TB. So Why Aren’t More People On It?

Texto completo: Tuberculosis struck 10 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 1.6 million of them - a toll greater than that of HIV, malaria, measles and Ebola combined. TB is the leading infectious killer around the globe; nearly 1.8 billion people are carrying the bacterium that causes the disease.
The world is sorely in need of new ways to prevent TB, not just treat it. Drugs to stave off the infection do exist, but the monthslong regimens are difficult and people often do not finish the prescribed courses.
That may soon change: A new drug course, lasting just one month, is just as effective as longer regimens at preventing TB, scientists reported earlier this year. The results have left experts hoping for new progress against a disease that has been an intractable enemy for centuries.
“I think it’s a moment of really extraordinary promise,” said Mike Frick, co-lead for TB at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization.
Among the plagues sweeping developing countries, TB has often taken a back seat to competing and urgent priorities, especially HIV. (The two are linked: HIV patients account for 1 in 5 TB deaths worldwide.)
In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to treat the deadliest strain of TB - but it was the first approval for a TB drug in more than 40 years. Diagnostic tests for the infection are not sensitive and mostly rely on sputum, which many sick people struggle to produce.
And prevention? “It’s really downplayed and it’s ignored, and it’s ignored to a degree that is scandalous,” said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
One challenge is identifying those who should receive preventive drugs. The drugs are the clear choice for the most vulnerable groups: people with HIV; people whose immune systems are compromised because they take biologic drugs for Crohn’s disease, arthritis or other diseases; and young children and others who share a home with someone infected.
Protection for these groups should last at least five years, studies suggest.
But 1 in 3 people worldwide harbor the TB bacteria, and just 1 in 10 will go on to develop the disease. Who among them should be treated?
“The biggest issue has been to identify those 10%,” said Dr. Eliud Wandwalo, senior coordinator for TB at the nonprofit Global Fund. “We don’t have any good indicator to show you which of these people who are infected might progress and become sick.”
For many people who are healthy, or who simply feel healthy, the drugs have been a tough sell.
For decades, the standard course has been an antibiotic called isoniazid that kills the bacteria causing TB only when they are replicating. The drug must be taken daily for nine months, in the hope of catching the bacteria as they multiply, and it can cause numbness, nausea and fever. Isoniazid also can cause liver toxicity, so people taking it are advised not to drink alcohol for the entire nine months.
“Traditionally, completion rates have been very poor,” said Alison Grant, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
Doctors sometimes decline to prescribe the antibiotic because of worries about exposing otherwise healthy people to the side effects, or contributing to a rise in drug-resistant bacteria if patients don’t complete the full course.
Both those concerns are unfounded, said Grant. Doctors “just stay away from it, despite the evidence showing otherwise.”
In the past decade, scientists have come up with two shorter courses: a drug called rifampin taken every day for four months; or a combination of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken once weekly for three months.
Still, for some people, remembering to take the pills - and all 11 pills together - once a week can be more challenging than taking them every day, Grant said.
An alternative emerged in March, when Chaisson and his colleagues published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that a regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken daily for one month, is as effective at preventing TB, safer and more likely to be completed than the traditional nine-month course of isoniazid.
The World Health Organization met to review this new regimen in July and is expected to endorse it later this year. The study was conducted only in people infected with HIV, however, and it is likely that the WHO will approve the regimen only for those patients.
Chaisson thinks preventive drugs should be given to a far larger population.
“If we had an intervention for HIV that reduces mortality by 37%, the WHO would have an emergency meeting and it would be recommended for uptake in the entire world,” he said. “But when it’s for TB, people just sort of shrug.”
“It’s just a stolid world of never-changing practices - slow to adopt, slow to change, slow to evolve,” Chaisson added.
Cost is another hurdle. The one- and three-month courses both rely on rifapentine, made by Sanofi. In 2013, after a yearlong advocacy campaign to lower the costs, Sanofi dropped the price of rifapentine in the three-month course from $71 to $32.
The new one-month course requires more rifapentine overall than the three-month regimen, and so is more expensive. Advocates and global health organizations are in intense negotiations with Sanofi to lower the cost to just $15 for the entire one-month treatment course.
At least two companies are said to be developing generic versions, which also may bring down the cost. Without a lower price, donors like the federal government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are unlikely to support the new course.
Still, experts said they are more optimistic about TB prevention than ever before.
Just a year ago, funding organizations still presented countries with a false choice between prioritizing antiretroviral therapy for HIV and preventive therapy for TB, said Chaisson.
But PEPFAR has begun to prioritize TB prevention. National governments will have to follow in order to turn back TB.
South Africa has shown what political will can accomplish, said Dr. Gavin Churchyard, a TB specialist based in Johannesburg. The country once had an abysmal TB preventive therapy program, with just a few thousand people taking the pills.
But in 2008, after Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, then the country’s health minister, made TB prevention a national priority, the numbers began to rise dramatically. By 2011, 350,000 people were enrolled in preventive therapy. Today, South Africa still has the world’s largest TB preventive therapy program, Churchyard said.
Chaisson did a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation, published in 2017 in the Lancet Global Health, suggesting that if such preventive therapy had been rolled out worldwide, several million deaths could have been averted.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. is planning to pay only a minority of publishers whose headlines will be featured in its coming news section, according to people familiar with the matter.
The specialized news section -- which will appear on the toolbar at the bottom of Facebook's mobile app -- is set to launch as early as the end of October and will include links to stories from about 200 publications, the people said.
A person familiar with the matter said Facebook had never planned to pay all the news outlets whose content it would link to in its news section. The plan is similar to what Facebook has done with its Watch section, which includes videos not paid for by Facebook, the person said. Taking into account companies that own multiple publications, Facebook will pay fees to about one-quarter of the organizations that will be involved at the launch, the person said.
Facebook is still negotiating with several big publishers, and in most cases talks have centered around how much of their reporting publishers would allow to be posted on the Facebook tab, the people familiar with the matter said. Facebook wants news organizations to allow access to all their stories for possible inclusion in the news tab, but some outlets have pushed for only allowing limited access.
The outlets in talks with Facebook include Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones & Co., the Washington Post, the New York Times, Business Insider, BuzzFeed, HuffPost and the Philadelphia Inquirer, the people said.
The licensing fees Facebook is offering range from several hundred thousand dollars for regional publications to as much as $3 million a year for national news outlets, the people said. The deals would be for three years.
Facebook plans to expand the number of publishers included in the program as the product develops, the people said. The feed will become more customizable and individually targeted, and will eventually include links from Facebook's local-news project "Today In."
The company's move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news. News Corp is the Journal's parent company.
Facebook will highlight only publishers that meet the criteria of its news-page index, which requires sites to focus on news reporting and bars those that repeatedly share misinformation and bombard readers with advertising. But the company, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, has been mindful to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, one person said. For example, while stories from Infowars won't be included, stories from Breitbart might appear, this person said.
"We've been working closely with news organizations to get this right by emphasizing original reporting and making it much easier to find the most relevant news on Facebook," said Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships.
Headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be chosen in some cases by editors and in others by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said. The "Top News" section, which will feature about 10 headlines, will be entirely curated by human editors. News in subsections, such as sports or entertainment, and a "suggested for you" section, will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising and all stories will direct readers to the publishers' own websites, the people said.
Facebook's curators will use a detailed list of criteria for which stories to highlight, including promoting outlets that were the first to report the news, the people said. Stories with named sources might also be given priority over those that rely on anonymous sources.
Facebook is looking to expand its team of curators to about 25 people, with some based in London, to work under Anne Kornblut, a Pulitzer Prize winner who joined Facebook in 2015 after stints at the Washington Post, New York Times and Boston Globe, the people said.

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The prime minister of Lebanon gave more than $ 16 million to a South African bikini model who said they had a romantic relationship after they met at a luxury resort in the Seychelles, according to South African court documents obtained by The New York Times.
The prime minister, Saad Hariri, was not in office when he sent the money starting in 2013, and the transfer does not appear to have violated any Lebanese or South African laws.
But the revelation in a South African court case this year of the extravagant gifts to a younger model comes during a difficult period for Mr. Hariri, the top Sunni Muslim politician in Lebanon and an American ally.
His business and political empires have fallen on hard times, depriving many employees of their pay. His family's construction conglomerate, Saudi Oger, ceased operations in 2017, and his media outlets have struggled to pay salaries.
A looming financial crisis in Lebanon has set off antigovernment protests. This month, Mr. Hariri said the Lebanese government would declare an "economic state of emergency" and push through austerity measures.
Mr. Hariri did not respond to questions sent to his media team about his relationship with the model, Candice van der Merwe, or any gifts to her.
The gifts have no clear tie to Lebanon's current economic woes and Mr. Hariri, a married father of three, was sufficiently wealthy to have made the payments himself. Forbes magazine estimated his net worth in 2013 at $ 1.9 billion, thanks largely to business interests he inherited after his father, Rafik Hariri, who also served as prime minister, was assassinated in Beirut in 2005.
Since then, the younger Hariri has remained one of Lebanon's best known political figures. He makes frequent state visits to Paris, Washington and Riyadh and favors pro-Western policies, but heads a power-sharing government that includes Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran.
His bank transfers to Ms. van der Merwe were made between his two terms as prime minister, but while he was the head of his political party, the Future Movement. He was 43 at the time of the first transfer, in 2013. He was then running family businesses in construction and other domains and living in France and Saudi Arabia.
Ms. van der Merwe was 20 years old. She had appeared in energy drink promotions and swimwear calendars, but her reported annual income had never exceeded $ 5,400.
In a promotional interview in a skimpy bikini conducted in conjunction with the publication of a swimsuit calendar in 2011, she said her interests included listening to Jack Johnson and Celine Dion, riding Jet Skis and flying helicopters with her father.
Then in May 2013, her assets suddenly soared, thanks to a transfer of $ 15,299,965 from a Lebanese bank.
"Lady luck, it would seem, suddenly smiled on the applicant," a South African judge wrote in 2015.
The transfer would likely have remained secret had the large sum not raised suspicions among the South African financial and tax authorities, who investigated and deemed it taxable income.
Ms. van der Merwe insisted the money was a gift, and not taxable according to South African law. In subsequent court cases, she argued the money had been given to her without conditions and identified her benefactor as Mr. Hariri.
"Love you my Saad :)," Ms. van der Merwe wrote in an email to Mr. Hariri in which she provided her bank account details so he could transfer the money, telling him it was so she could buy property.
The money landed in her account shortly afterward.
The New York Times was unable to reach Ms. van der Merwe, but two of her previous lawyers, her current lawyer, and her father, who has represented her in tax court, declined to comment and to make her available for an interview.
In an affidavit cited in the court documents, Ms. van der Merwe said she had been recruited at age 19 to travel to an exclusive resort in the Seychelles Islands called The Plantation Club that was "frequented by some of the richest private individuals in the world," including billionaires "for whom money is no object."
At this "playground of the super wealthy," she said, "it is the norm for lavish parties and events to be held" and models were flown in "to lend a sense of glamour and exclusivity." The models' passports were taken when they arrived and they were forbidden from taking photos.
Ms. van der Merwe spent four days at the resort in 2012, she said, and connected with people she met because of her "healthy lifestyle" and other qualities.
"I have also been told that I have a very engaging personality," she said.
Other trips followed. On her first two, she flew economy class. Later, she was upgraded to first or business class.
During a trip in March 2013, she said, she told friends that her "dream car" was the Audi R8. After she returned home, she had an accident that totaled her car and cracked her cellphone screen.
A car dealer soon called her to pick up a new Audi R8 Spyder, which had been paid for and registered in her name. She also received two new cellphones, including one with international roaming, and a Land Rover Evoque.
The two vehicles were worth more than $ 250,000, a sum that was added to her tax bill. Her lawyers wrote in 2015 that they were gifts from the same "extremely well-to-do Middle Eastern gentleman" who sent her the money.
When government investigators asked about the $ 15 million transfer, a bank official said that "the sender and beneficiary are boyfriend/girlfriend and are currently together in the Seychelles."
Ms. van der Merwe bought properties worth more than $ 10 million, including a house in Cape Town's upscale Fresnaye neighborhood with an outdoor swimming pool and commanding ocean views. She also lent $ 2.7 million to a real estate company her father was involved with and made other transactions, leaving $ 537,000 in her account, she said.
The tax authorities considered her claim that the money was a gift implausible and suspected the funds had been for her father, Gary van der Merwe, a businessman who had fought repeated court battles with the tax authorities over his own business dealings. The authorities levied income tax on the sum, froze Ms. van der Merwe's assets and appointed a curator to oversee them until the matter was settled.
So Mr. Hariri stepped in again, sending Ms. van der Merwe an additional $ 1 million to help cover her legal and living expenses, according to court documents.
In correspondence with the tax authorities, Ms. van der Merwe's lawyers acknowledged it was hard to believe that "such largess was bestowed on a young girl" by someone with whom she had "a casual relationship." But Ms. van der Merwe insisted the money and cars were gifts for her personal use with no conditions.
She reached a settlement with the tax authorities in 2016, which she appealed last year. A judge dismissed that case this month.
In January, she sued government officials for $ 65 million in damages she attributed to the tax authorities' pursuit of her. These documents made Mr. Hariri's role in the case public this year.
In the suit, she argues that she had to sell the house because the asset freeze prevented her from paying for its upkeep. She also says the court cases and related publicity had caused irreparable damage to her career and severed her link to Mr. Hariri.
"The plaintiff's relationship with Mr. Hariri was terminated, which resulted in the loss of financial benefits that would have accrued to her from the relationship if it had been allowed to persist without outside interference," the suit says.
