Texto completo: AGOTIME BEH, Ghana - After he graduated from university, Vozbeth Kofi Azumah was reluctant to tell anyone - even his mother - what he planned to do for a living.
"I'm a farmer," he said, buzzing his motorcycle between freshly plowed fields on a recent afternoon. "Here, that's an embarrassment."
In some parts of the world, farmers are viewed with respect and cultivating the land is seen as an honorable trade. But in a region where most agriculture is still for subsistence - relying on cutlass, hoe and a hope for rain - farming is a synonym for poverty.
But Azumah is among a growing number of young, college-educated Africans fighting the stigma by seeking to professionalize farming. They are applying scientific approaches and data-crunching apps not just to increase yields, but to show that agriculture can be profitable.
They call themselves "agripreneurs."
It's a steep challenge. Undeveloped distribution networks, poor roads and fickle water supplies are difficult hurdles for even the most competent farmer, and many of these would-be farmers have little training or experience.
However, these agricultural entrepreneurs hope both to make money and to tackle the confounding calculus of a continent that holds about 65% of the world's most arable uncultivated land, but which imports over $35 billion in food a year, according to a report by the African Development Bank.
In Ghana, they've been bolstered by the government, which is in the midst of an ambitious national rollout to increase agricultural capacity and entice young people back to the farm. As in much of the rest of the continent, Ghana's farmers are aging, even as young people pour into cities in search of jobs amid skyrocketing youth unemployment.
Rolling up sleeves and bucking convention, some young farmers have left behind cushy jobs. They tend to be people who have the means to lease or buy large tracts of land, and afford a loss. They often have little more training on how to rear chicks and till soil than from YouTube videos. But underscoring their work is a sense that what's at stake is Africa's economic future.
"We have to make farming sexy," said Emmanuel Ansah-Amprofi, as laborers on his farm in Gomoa Mpota, in the central region, planted cassava shoots in neat rows.
A few years ago, Ansah-Amprofi was working in immigration law, when he discovered in a local market that the onion he was buying had been imported from Holland.
"I was really angry with our country," said Ansah-Amprofi, 39. "How can we be importing this much vegetables, and have a lot of youth on the street? How can we have all this land, good weather, a lot of water bodies, but we still are importing onions?"
"I went straight to my home and Googled, 'How difficult is it to farm?'"
Two years later, in 2016, he started a farm growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, and also helped to found Trotro Tractor, an app that lets farmers who once tilled by hand locate and rent shareable tractors.
For Azumah, 27, the future is giant rats. And giant snails.
Both are a rare delicacy here, and typically harvested from the wild. Azumah, who has a bachelor's degree in social science, spotted a missed opportunity: captive breeding. When he told his mother, Martha Amuzu, she wept.
"Oh, I cried," she said, sitting in the family farmhouse in the Volta region, about four hours from Accra, the capital. "My expectation for him was to advance his education, to work in an office wearing suit and tie."
Outside her doorstep, her son has transformed what was once a small subsistence plot into "West African Snail Masters," his snail hatchery.
He has just begun with 500 fist-size land snails plucked from the forest floor in Ghana in the rainy season, when they are plentiful. On a recent afternoon, Azumah wandered between the newly built pens, testing soil moisture and alkalinity. In another outbuilding, he fed leaves to pens of the giant rats, also known as grasscutters.
When his mother saw his modern methods, she was won over. "There are others working in white-collar jobs and they hardly get paid," she said.
Azumah now produces online workshops to get others interested in raising snails. "I see a university degree as, you have learned to think outside the box, to come up with solutions" to problems like poverty and food insecurity, he said.
Though about 60% of Africa's population is younger than 24, the average farmer's age is 60, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Without intervention, experts say, Africa runs the risk of having no one to replace its farmers as they die.
At the same time, low use of fertilizer, and reliance on things like rain-fed irrigation, has left Africa with crop yields that are only 20% to 30% of what could be produced, research has found. While there are large, successful farms on the continent, most farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are smallholders, cultivating an acre or less. Many farmers are hardly able to feed their families, much less engage in business ventures.
Since President Nana Akufo-Addo took office in 2017, Ghana made raising the productivity of its agricultural sector a key initiative.
Augustine Collins Ntim, the deputy minister for local government and rural development, said he was struck to find on his travels to the United States and Europe that some farmers were well-to-do.
"You come back home in Ghana, our farmers are living in abject poverty," he said. "The gap was political commitment and leadership."
Over 2,700 agricultural officers, each issued a motorbike by the government, have been deployed across the country to educate farmers on best practices, such as which crops are most adapted to climate change. - (The New York Times)

DOCTOR DEBATE OVER SINGLE PAYER KICKS OFF IN EARNEST: The Journal of the American Medical Association published an opinion piece Friday that backs the position that the U.S. should turn to a fully government-financed healthcare system.
The opinion piece was written by Drs. Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein, the co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program. The move comes ahead of the American Medical Association’s annual meeting in Chicago beginning June 8, when the group will debate whether to drop its opposition to government-financed healthcare, known as “single payer.”
“While they've published many viewpoints that were critical or skeptical of single-payer, this is the first time in more than 15 years that JAMA has published a pro-single payer viewpoint,” said Clare Fauke, spokeswoman for PNHP. “We believe the rising public attention to Medicare for All — including in Congress — is clearly why they're interested in publishing about the issue.”
The AMA is a member of the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a coalition made up of drug companies, insurers, and hospitals who are pushing back on extending the government’s role in healthcare and instead pushing for more government funding for Obamacare.
In the opinion piece, the doctors noted the frustrations they face with administration and billing practices, and said the current system was overly complex. They acknowledged that any shift to a single-payer system would probably require more funding to address the doctor shortage, and said laws would have to be carefully designed.
They said it would be best to pass a federal rather than state laws and called “halfway measures” such as creating a public option “politically attractive but economically unworkable.”

MORE HOUSE LAWMAKERS SIGN ON TO MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT: Three more House Democrats, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, David Price of North Carolina, and John Yarmuth of Kentucky, have co-sponsored the Medicare for All Act, bringing the total to 111.
MEASLES COUNT REACHES 27-YEAR HIGH: The number of confirmed measles cases across the United States has reached a new high of 971, the worst outbreak since the virus was declared eliminated from the country in 2000 and the most cases since 1992. Public health officials have attributed the sharp rise in cases this year, which isn't yet half over, to parents not vaccinating their children.
LOUISIANA GOVERNOR SIGNS 6-WEEK ABORTION BAN: Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards defied fellow Democrats on Thursday by signing six-week abortion ban into law. The signature puts Edwards further out of step with the Democratic Party, but Edwards is a Catholic who is running for reelection this year in a deeply conservative and religious state. He has signed limits on abortion into law before.
NBCUNIVERSAL THREATENS TO BOYCOTT GEORGIA OVER ABORTION LAW: NBCUniversal is considering joining a growing list of film companies in blacklisting states that pass strong limits on abortion. "If any of these laws are upheld, it would strongly impact our decision-making on where we produce our content in the future," NBCUniversal told the Hill on Thursday.
STUDY: ECONOMIC PROBLEMS GET IN THE WAY OF MEETING WORK REQUIREMENTS: The Urban Institute found in a study published Thursday that able-bodied Medicaid enrollees who would need to abide by work requirements for coverage disproportionately face greater barriers to employment than those who are privately insured. More than one in five Medicaid enrollees did not graduate high school, and about 22% do not have internet access. They were also more likely to live in areas with high unemployment and poverty rates than privately insured adults. The report compared 1,180 Medicaid enrollees who would not be exempt from the requirement to work at least 20 hours per week with 12,097 privately insured adults.
DEMAND FOR ANTIBIOTIC-FREE MEAT RISES: United States Department of Agriculture findings show a rise in concerns about antibiotics used in animal-food products. Between 2015 and 2017, U.S. sales of antibiotics for food-animal production declined 30%, after increases between 2009 and 2015. Consumers in the U.S. are now more inclined to purchase meat raised without antibiotics, particularly poultry. In 2017, about 44% of U.S. chickens were raised without antibiotics, an increase from 2.7% in 2012.
PAIN TASK FORCE CALLS FOR PATIENT-CENTERED CARE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH: The Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force released a report Thursday on that emphasized a need for patient-centered care to establish an alliance between the patient and physician. The report also calls for a multidisciplinary approach to treating pain, including prescribing non-opiate medicines to decrease the risk for dependence, implementing physical and occupational therapy programs, providing those in pain with cognitive behavioral therapy resources, and offering alternative treatments including acupuncture and yoga.
FDA WEIGHS REQUIRING BLISTER PACKS FOR OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS: The Food and Drug Administration is opening a public docket to solicit feedback about how it might require that certain prescription opioids be made available in blister packs that would limit how many drugs people get, make them harder for children to access, and help doctors think more carefully about how many pills they prescribe.
FDA WARNS COMPANY BEHIND UNAPPROVED STEM CELL PRODUCTS: The FDA warned R3 Stem Cell, LLC against continuing to distribute unapproved stem cell products to patients Thursday in a letter. The stem cell products are marketed to treat a variety of diseases and conditions, such as Lyme disease, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and kidney failure. “We continue to see companies and individuals use questionable marketing campaigns to take advantage of vulnerable patients and their families with unproven claims about their unapproved stem cell products,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless.
CANCER MORTALITY KEEPS FALLING: Cancer death rates declined from 1999 to 2016, according to the National Cancer Institute’s new 2019 report. Rates of new cancers in men increased between 1999 and 2008, but after 2008 the rates continuously decreased until 2015. New cancer rates remained relatively constant for women between 1999 and 2015. "We are encouraged by the fact that this year's report continues to show declining cancer mortality for men, women, and children, as well as other indicators of progress," said Betsy Kohler, executive director of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

Texto completo: Flying Southwest this summer and like to stash your boarding pass in those colorful paper holders they hand out at the airport?
You'll have to BYOBP holder beginning June 1.
Ticket jackets, as the document holders are called, are going the way of peanuts on Southwest.
The airline, which doles out about 22 million ticketjackets a year, is eliminating them to "reduce waste, protect our environment, use less paper and ultimately become a greener company,'' spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.
Southwest is the last major U. S. airline to ditch the ticket jackets, a relic from an era when airlines issued paper tickets.
Most tickets are now electronic, and boarding passes have moved that way, too. Travelers who don't fly Southwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, may not even know they still exist.
United Airlines said it eliminated ticket jackets in the early 2000s. Delta Air Lines did away with them in 2008. Alaska says it did away with them more than a decade ago. The last time American used them was in 2014. Spirit Airlines eliminated them in late 2016 as mobile boarding passes and self-service check-in kiosks grew in popularity.
Landson said Southwest has seen an increase in the number of travelers using mobile boarding passes and decided now was the time to eliminate the paper holders.
"Through this change in behavior, we feel like we’ve reached a good point to transition away from paper ticket jackets,'' he said.
The look of Southwest's ticket jackets, like other airlines', evolved with the airline's style and slogans over the years. The ticket jackets included gate information, Southwest reservations information and ads for Southwest products including gift cards. In the past, baggage claim checks were stapled to them.
A decade ago, one Southwest frequent flier got his close-up on Southwest's ticket jackets.
Terry Buchen, president of Golf Agronomy International, said he was selected to be on the ticket jacket after he gushed nonstop about Southwest at a party the airline hosted for frequent fliers in Baltimore.
Southwest flew Buchen and his wife to Austin, Texas, for a photo shoot and treated them to a luxury hotel, meals and a new outfit from Nordstrom for the ad. (Yes, he got to keep it. )
Buchen was on the ticket jacket from 2007 to 2009.
He was often recognized at the airport by fellow travelers and Southwest employees, earning the nickname "the ticket jacket guy," he told the New York Times in 2008.
"People used to ask me for autographs,'' Buchen said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. "It was a lot of fun. I really had fun. ''
Buchen, 72, has a framed copy of the ticket jacket at his home outside Boise, Idaho, and saved about 100 of the ticket jackets with his picture on them.
The last time Buchen used a Southwest ticket jacket was 2016. Not because he's moved to mobile boarding passes — he has but still prints out a hard copy in case his phone dies or malfunctions — but because he doesn't fly Southwest following his move from Virginia to Idaho.
Delta has better flight options from Boise, he said. But no ticket jackets.
Buchen said he folds his backup Delta boarding pass in half and sticks it in the back left pocket of his pants.
He said he will always fondly remember ticket jackets.
"It was such a tradition for so many years,'' he said. "It just made you feel good, sort of like you were carrying a passport. And you'd open it up like a book and there was a boarding pass and a receipt. ''
Travelers nostalgic for ticket jackets, including Southwest's current version, can find plenty for sale on eBay.

Democrats cling to faith in Robert Mueller by insisting they know what's in his heart rather than his report

Texto completo: Even though now-former special counsel Robert Mueller let them down, Democrats and liberals in the media so desperately want to preserve their faith in him that they now insist he’s speaking directly to them in a secret language that will finally lead them to precious impeachment.
Anyone objectively watching Mueller’s investigation knew well in advance of his report that he wasn't going to find a conspiracy between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Every indictment handed out was a letdown for those who were sure Mueller would find a crucial link, some undeniable proof that Trump was coordinating with the Kremlin.
Then the final report came out, finding no evidence of collusion. On top of all that, there was no recommendation for obstruction of justice charges.
There was, perhaps, one last, great hope: Mueller’s first and only live, on-camera statement. He reiterated his report’s findings and made clear that his office worked within Department of Justice regulations that say a sitting president cannot be indicted — a fact we were already aware of.
But there was also this in Mueller’s remarks: “[T]he Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”
Ah-ha! There it was! That was everything Trump’s opponents needed to once again revitalize their devotion to Mueller as their savior.
The line from Mueller’s statement was nothing more than a civics lesson on the political process of removing a president. It's something House Democrats were already well aware of, as Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has been calling for Trump’s impeachment since January 2017.
But Mueller’s apostles in the media and the Democratic Party believe he was in fact transmitting a signal that only they could decipher. The New York Times editorial board literally offered up “key points” from Mueller’s statement that the paper then “translated” for their true meaning.
Mueller spoke in his statement about the severity of obstructing justice, saying that “When a subject of an investigation obstructs … it strikes at the core of their government’s effort to find the truth…” The Times asserted in earnest that Mueller’s use of the word “when” about a hypothetical investigation was a double secret code word indicating Trump's guilt.
“Translation: Did you notice I said ‘when’ not ‘if’? Obstruction happened; I’m being coy about who I suspect committed it,” wrote the Times in its psychic channeling of Mueller.
Mueller also said in his statement that he did not question Attorney General William Barr’s “good faith” in deciding to release the full special counsel report. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump did his part to decipher the hidden meaning of that line, writing in an article that it “rais[ed] the question about points at which [Mueller’s] confidence in Barr’s efforts was less robust.”
What Mueller explicitly said in his statement was largely a matter of contradictions. On the one hand, he said there was “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy” in relation to Russia and the election but on the other hand, he said that his office determined in advance that it “would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime” in relation to obstruction. At the same time, he said that “if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”
Why would Mueller stipulate that his office “would not reach a determination one way or the other” about obstruction charges but would make a determination on the conspiracy charge? They would both be crimes. Why the double standard? Why would he say that he did not intend to “reach a determination one way or the other” but also say that if he was sure there was no crime, “we would have said so”? The point of declining to "reach a determination one way or the other" is that you determine nothing, regardless of whether you're "sure there was no crime."
This is, at minimum, confounding and at maximum, totally incoherent.
But Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, who is running for president, decrypted the secret message. “What Robert Mueller basically did was return an impeachment referral,” she tweeted after the statement. If what Mueller “basically did” is exactly what Democrats have wanted all along and knew they could do without his permission, what was the point of the special counsel?
It was cover for what will be a meritless effort to impeach the president.
There was no code or secret or signal. Mueller’s statement was exactly what it was. A close to an investigation that found nothing.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law Tuesday that requires the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion, further fanning the flames in the abortion debate nationwide.
I'm still pro-choice, but the left worries me
By Saritha Prabhu
On abortion, extremism rules.
We're increasingly seeing the debate being dominated by the extremists on both sides. We've also seen, in the past few years, the debate shifting on many fronts. The political left has gone from at least paying lip service to the Bill Clinton standard of "safe, legal and rare" to increasing comfort with more abortion.
The zeitgeist trend on the liberal side is toward the almost-celebratory, in-your-face tone seen in "Shout your abortion," and also abortion-rights-expanding bills in Virginia, New York and elsewhere.
The right has met this with its own monstrous counterpart: The recent Alabama law is precisely designed to challenge the Supreme Court to take up the case — a ban on abortion except to protect the life of the mother and serious jail time for abortion providers.

But there is another crucial front, and that is science — a science debate advancing to reveal ever more wondrous detail of burgeoning life in the womb.
The challenge is that advancing neonatal research and technology keeps throwing a monkey wrench into the debate. It denies us the luxury and self-delusion of thinking about the fetus as a clump of cells beyond the early weeks of pregnancy.
Which is not to say that abortion should be outlawed, only that we adjust our thinking on the issue.
What is happening here is what has been happening in other political issues: The silent majority of Americans, where the squishy middle resides, is held hostage to the intractable extremities.
As we all know, extremists of any kind are fixated on principle and purity and political victory at all costs, not on pragmatism, compromise and real-world concerns. For purists on both sides, it is about righteousness and condemnation of the other side.
It is also a position where there is none of the conflicted, moral trade-offs that are often present in everyday life. And it is often undeniably about simplification of the issue.
One extreme goes with extreme autonomy to the woman, to the extent that it allows late-term abortion; the other extreme sees personhood in a fertilized embryo and is so pro-life that it'll endanger the lives of legions of women.
But for the moderates, where I count myself, the issue solves itself in simpler terms: Banning abortion is out of the question because it will only drive it underground, but most of us can manage our moral discomfort enough to be OK with abortion early on in the pregnancy; abortion in the cases of rape, incest and for the life of the mother; and in the rare, wrenching cases, later-term abortion to protect the life of the mother.
"The life of the mother. " That's a phrase with meaning. When that is supplemented with "the health of the mother," as in the New York law, pro-lifers, understandably, worry about the abuse of the exception.
Meanwhile, a few loose ends: If liberals want science to be respected on the climate issue, they must respect the science on abortion as well. They should realize that as gestation advances, a fetus comes closer to being a baby, and elective abortion up to the time of delivery essentially means terminating a human who deserves dignity and has rights.
Likewise, the pro-life community should be more supportive of more freely available birth control, and more support for pregnant women especially from impoverished backgrounds.
Personally, I'm still pro-choice, but in recent years I went from hard pro-choice to soft pro-choice. To me, the pill and Roe v. Wade were powerful for women's self-actualization, bodily autonomy and economic freedom.
But I've become increasingly discomfited by the left's brave new world of abortion triumphalism and abortion-whenever-during-pregnancy.
In an age of abortion extremism, let's be clear: Either side winning completely is to enter a realm of dystopia.
Saritha Prabhu is a columnist at the Tennesseean, where this column first appeared.
What others are saying
Gracy Olmstead, The New York Times: "The anti-abortion movement has always been passionately devoted to defending the rights of the unborn. If you believe that unborn children have rights and dignity, as I and other pro-lifers do, then ending abortion is more important than virtually any other issue we deal with as a society and has to remain the focus of our cause. . . . A consistent life ethic would urge pro-lifers to defend the vulnerable and voiceless, regardless of partisanship or ease. "
Elly Lonon, The Washington Post: "I had an abortion. I'm not going to tell you how old I was or what my circumstances were at the time. I won't mention whether birth control was used or whether it wasn't. I’m not going to tell you whether the guy is or is not still a part of my life, whether it was a one-night stand or a long-term relationship. I'm not going to discuss the health of either party involved in the consensual or nonconsensual sex, nor the viability of the embryo. None of those details are pertinent. I got pregnant. I didn't want to be pregnant. I had a medical procedure to remedy the situation. Full stop. I am not my abortion. Everything I am, however, is because of that abortion. "
Charles Dern, The (Pennsylvania) Intelligencer: "First, pro-abortion organizations have been at the forefront of suppressing medical evidence by consistently opposing laws that would mandate that a woman be shown an ultrasound of her unborn child as well as being given the facts of fetal development. Second, many secular ethicists presently stretch their credibility in that they currently are, with all sobriety, debating the morality of 'after-birth abortion,' aka, infanticide. "
What our readers are saying
This is how we do it, folks. Thanks to the Supreme Court upholding part of the Indiana law, we keep chipping away at these pro-abortion laws bit by bit. Eventually, we will prevail in saving human lives from destruction out of inconvenience.
— Larry Hubble
We are relieved that Indiana at least dropped the part of the original bill that required the family to keep the fetus at home, take it on family vacations, and send it to college . . . whew. In other words, the government of Indiana did not yet entirely take over all decisions for individuals; not yet.
— Mary Melcher
The Supreme Court delivered a small victory in establishing that an unborn baby is a person who has dignity and autonomy, and deserves a respectful burial.
— @USReading
This is sickening! This is just pushing religious beliefs onto others. God does not judge us; he loves us and understands the decisions we make. Who's making money from the Supreme Court upholding this part of the Indiana law?

Assange is a spy, not a journalist

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a "nonstate hostile intelligence service." Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an "intelligence agency" for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his "thermonuclear device" – releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables "included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential.
These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety."
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange's decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, "We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them."
Assange's stolen classified documents didn't just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered "a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks" as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange's disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his "Gitmo files "which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange's stolen documents – the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida's captured operational commander – revealed that Faraj had "reported on al-Qaida's methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means"; that he had "received a letter from UBL's designated courier" who was "the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan"; and that "in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar," Pakistan.
The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike "reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections." So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures "collateral damage" and admitted WikiLeaks might get "blood on our hands." Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes

Adequate public investment would be best gift to Class of '19

Texto completo: Around the turn of the last century, the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie paid to build 1,689 libraries across the United States. Many are still in use, celebrated as monumental works of philanthropy.
They should be seen as monuments to the failure of public policy. The United States could have built a lot more libraries by taxing the incomes of Carnegie and his fellow Gilded Age plutocrats but, at the turn of the last century, there was no federal income tax.
A new generation of plutocrats has amassed great fortunes, in part because the federal government has minimized the burden of taxation. Americans once again are reduced to applauding acts of philanthropy necessitated by failures of policy.
Robert Smith, a wealthy financier, announced during recent graduation ceremonies at Morehouse College that he would repay the student loans taken by the 396 men in this year's graduating class. The promise, which may cost Mr. Smith up to $40 million, was an act of generosity gratefully received by the new graduates of the historically black, all-male Atlanta college.
But their gratitude underscores the reality that hundreds of thousands of other members of the class of 2019 will be carrying unrelieved burdens of debt as they begin their adult lives. On average, recipients of bachelor's degrees in 2016 left school owing about $30,301, according to the most recent federal data. Parents, on average, incurred another $33,291 in debt.
The substitution of philanthropy for public policy is most glaring in the realm of health care, where it has become appallingly common for Americans to beg friends and strangers for the money necessary to pay for treatment. The fund-raising website GoFundMe estimates that it hosts about 250,000 fund-raisers for medical expenses each year.
The same dynamic is at work in higher education. Since 2001, a handful of elite institutions led by Princeton University have committed to tap their endowments to provide funding for students to graduate without loans. Last year, Michael Bloomberg pledged $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to reduce the reliance of Hopkins students on borrowed money. But most American colleges, including Morehouse, lack the resources to make such a commitment.
A number of the Democratic candidates for president have proposed large increases in federal funding for higher education to offset the rise of tuition costs and the decline of state funding.
The problem facing policymakers is not merely a lack of will, but also a lack of money. The federal government collected 16.5 percent of the nation's economic output last year — well below the 17.4 percent average federal share over the last half century. The primary reason for the shortfall, of course, is the steady reduction of income taxation. No one has benefited more from that trend than financiers like Morehouse College's 2019 graduation speaker.
Mr. Smith co-founded the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, which invests in software companies, and he has amassed his fortune thanks in part to a provision of federal tax law known as the "carried interest loophole" — a provision he has publicly supported.
The loophole is projected to cost the government about $15.6 billion in lost revenue between 2016 and 2025. President Trump promised to close it during the 2016 campaign, and he promised to close it as part of his 2017 tax bill. But he did not keep that promise. Instead, the White House and congressional Republicans honored the wishes of the finance industry.
Closing that loophole would be a much better graduation present for the class of 2019.

Why the UFO story is far more interesting than you think

Texto completo: The New York Times has made waves with a new report on sightings by U.S. Navy aviators of unidentified flying objects between 2014 and 2015. But the UFO issue, which follows a similar 2017 story, is far more interesting than the reporters let on.
The U.S. government does not know what these UFOs actually are. The report focuses on witnesses of so-called "Tic Tacs," but other shapes and sizes of UFOs have also been credibly recorded by the U.S., British, Chinese, Russian, and other governments for the past 65 years. But what are these strange things?
Most informed individuals I have talked to believe that the Tic Tac-like UFOs are unmanned vehicles operating under direction from either a manned or larger unmanned vessel. A particularly interesting evidentiary point here is the witness testimony by Commander David Fravor during his time as commanding officer for a naval fighter squadron assigned to the Nimitz carrier strike group. In the now-infamous November 2004 Nimitz incident, Fravor describes seeing both the Tic Tacs and "something in the water... looks like waves are going to crash over the top and you're going to get this white-water."
Some discredit these witness reports. The New York Times report, for example, interviews astrophysicist Leon Golub. Golub suggests that the aircrew testimony is a result of "bugs in the code for the imaging and display systems, atmospheric effects and reflections, neurological overload from multiple inputs during high-speed flight."
I strongly disagree, because the credible witness statements are numerous, matched to data recordings, and associated with a far larger set of similar incidents currently not public. But while natural phenomena such as that under the theoretical phenomena of ball lightning is a strong possibility in some UFO cases, I strongly believe other UFOs reported by naval aviators and other military professionals are not natural phenomena.
First, UFOs have repeatedly shown what seems to be intelligence in their operation and behavior-response to manned aircraft and monitoring systems in their vicinity. I am led to believe that the Russians (including in the Soviet era) have repeatedly tried and failed to shoot down UFOs, which have practiced evasive techniques.
In addition, UFOs have shown an ability to travel at supersonic speeds with anti-gravity characteristics. Some underwater phenomena are also capable of supercavitation speeds of hundreds of miles per hour underwater. Note that when it comes to underwater objects, the recorded size indicates they are not torpedoes or vessels of any known type.
Third, UFOs manifest a continuing and special interest in military-nuclear technology (I believe it is notable that credible sightings began following the first use of atomic weapons). Former nuclear forces officers have testified that UFOs have, on occasion, even deactivated U.S. nuclear missiles during test operations.
Fourth, UFOs often show evidence of plasma manipulation, possibly in relation to manifested cloaking capabilities.
I am also extraordinarily confident these UFOs are not the creation of any current government or private interest. They are definitely not U.S. in origin, and they are far in advance of Chinese and Russian capabilities - including in the field of hypersonic weaponry (which the Russians lead in).
So where does this leave us?
With many questions and the need to do more research. Fortunately, albeit secretly, the U.S. government continues to do just that, as do private interests. But the key here is for the collected data to be central in our analysis.
You should, for example, listen to credible individuals such as Luis Elizondo -- former head of the Pentagon's former UFO research agency, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. Elizondo does not talk about aliens. But you should not listen to Elizondo's To The Stars Academy colleague, Tom DeLonge (the musician is overexcited and says things that are unbound from analytical credibility).
Still, this is an interesting issue in many areas. Take the research by NASA into space-time manipulation, for example. Or the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program-contracted study into faster than light travel. Take a guess why the study was authorized.
Photo Caption:This photo issued Thursday March 3, 2011 by The National Archives in Britain of circa March 2004 shows a doughnut-shaped phenomenon photographed by a retired RAF officer and sent to his old bosses tasked with investigating UFOs.

Texto completo: Quick, before his presidential ambitions vaporize completely, let's rewind to a happier point in the ascension story of Beto O'Rourke, the Kennedy-toothed, former congressman from El Paso who came within a couple hundred thousand votes of unseating the incumbent Republican senator, Ted Cruz, in the 2018 midterms - which would have been something.
It was something, as filmmaker David Modigliani's admiring HBO documentary "Running With Beto" (airing Tuesday) attempts to portray. The camera intimately follows O'Rourke's earnest, grass-roots campaign as it gains momentum over several months, riding shotgun with the candidate and his closest aides as he road-trips to all 254 Texas counties and speaks passionately to small crowds made up of beaming believers and stone-faced voters, many of whom keep their arms folded with ingrained, red-state doubt. O'Rourke's luck improves, the universe loosens and the hoped-for mojo bursts through. The crowds get larger; an excitement takes hold; the national media develops a crush.
Though the events seen in "Running With Beto" are barely a year old, the film can't help but feel outdated and already archival. Whatever passion the 46-year-old stirred in his home state (and beyond) has since morphed this spring into a series of missteps on the national stage as O'Rourke, rejuvenated by solo road trips and the privilege to soul-search, became one of many, many Democratic hopefuls for president.
The Vanity Fair magazine profile of him in the April issue - with its Annie Leibovitz photographs and an uncomfortably self-aggrandizing cover quote ("Man, I'm just born to be in it") - landed with a thud. O'Rourke's habit of standing on diner counters to rouse Iowa voters seemed more ill-mannered than casually cool. The poll numbers turned south.
Political commentators and cultural critics have already seized on this rare occurrence of Gen-X hubris in action, recognizing the great sin of any Fugazi-loving, progressive bro who used to be in his own failed rock band: Without taking a dime of PAC money or corporate campaign contributions, O'Rourke has been recast as a sellout, a poser, a trustafarian trying to relate to the common folk. All those surprise pitfalls into which he unwittingly pitfell, simply by trying too hard, believing in himself, reading too deeply and empathizing too conspicuously. Shame on him!
If O'Rourke were part of the millennial generation, the boundless optimism seen in "Running With Beto" (and running with him still) would sound much more melodious, because if you're a millennial, selling out ceases to be any sort of character flaw. This is the Instagram crowd, which was taught from birth to sense their inherent gifts and seize their own destinies, with no limit to self-branding opportunities. At its heart, "Running With Beto" wants to be a movie about Pete Buttigieg.

How is this possibly fair? It isn't, but it remains a flawed trait of O'Rourke's (and my) generation - to crap on one another's hopes and dreams the moment we sense a calculated move, a phony marketing plan or the stench of true politics. And so it happens that Gen X's political legacy will instead belong to the likes of former House speaker Paul D. Ryan and his love of self-determined capitalism above all else, or to newly sworn Supreme Court justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanagh, champing at the bit to roll back much of the social progress that once stirred hope in people rather than fill them with reactionary zeal. It's so messed up.
But all this is miles and miles away from the emotional or political territory that Modigliani's film sets out to explore. "Running With Beto" rarely rises above a desire to be a fly on the wall, on the off chance that it will witness history. For campaign junkies, the film is stuffed with the real-life grind of ground-level work, not unlike an extra-long episode of Showtime's wheels-up docuseries "The Circus" - the endless driving, the ringing of doorbells and shaking of hands; the impromptu speeches, the sweat-stained dress shirts, the face-rubbing exhaustion.
O'Rourke is revealed to be one of those individuals who takes great comfort in referring to himself to in the plural form, always a "we" where "I" is perhaps too lonely, too responsible in the face of adversity: We gotta run. What are we going to do? Nobody asked us to do this. Should we make it official?
Part of this comes from O'Rourke's evident dedication to an equitable domestic arrangement: As a husband and father circa 2018 he must, at a minimum, find the time and effort to present as a helpful and capable partner-parent - a challenge Modigliani could have worked harder to explore beyond driveway basketball games and short-order pancakes in the kitchen. How does the O'Rourke household function? There are only hints of its pleasures and tensions.
O'Rourke's wife, Amy, remains something of a cipher throughout the film, plastering a smile on her public face and saying all the supportive things that need to be said, while somehow seeming less than thrilled with her husband's ambitions, especially when the couple's smart, camera-friendly children (Ulysses, Molly and Henry) pine for something more than a FaceTime call from Dad.
This, too, is a generational concern, the work-life balance that we tend to wear like cinder-block necklaces. "Running With Beto" touches lightly on O'Rourke's strained relationship with his father, which went through a prickly phase of overbearingness matched by teen rebellion.
Nothing stresses out a modern dad more than the specter of a 1970s-'80s rerun of this dynamic - the fear that he will be remembered mostly for his relentless commitment to being out of town. Many Gen-Xers grew up as latchkey kids who were forbidden from calling our parents at work unless someone was bleeding to death; Beto and Amy O'Rourke, like their peers, clearly fret over the emotional toll his campaign will take on the family unit.
Thus, a scene in which Henry retreats behind the couch one night to call his father, and instead gets his voice mail message, resonates painfully with other recent documentaries about adults who work their tails off in today's intensely wired political/media landscape. Remember how, in Liz Garbus's 2018 Showtime docuseries "The Fourth Estate," New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman was seen assuring her son, by phone, that he can't die in his nightmares? Very often in "Running With Beto," a viewer can't be blamed for wondering whether the candidate might just be happier back home, as a nominally employed community activist - or, if his ambitions burn so hotly, as the mayor of El Paso?

As it checks off the boxes that make a typical inside-the-campaign documentary (including clips from Cruz's campaign appearances, in which the senator clownishly but shrewdly rouses Texas's conservative base with boogeyman notions of O'Rourke's liberalism), "Running With Beto" works toward one of the candidate's finest and virally shining moments: his reply at a campaign stop in Houston to being asked whether he supports NFL players who take a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in police shootings.
Oddly, though, "Running With Beto" is most compelling when O'Rourke isn't in it. In moving portraits of some of his die-hard supporters, the film finally becomes the soaring ode to grass-roots politics that it desires to be, conveying just how hard it is to knock on doors, post signs and carry one's pride as a Democrat in a state so determinedly red.
"I'm guilty of being asleep at the wheel," says Shannon Gay, a feisty, gun-owning O'Rourke supporter who describes her one-stoplight town of Bulverde as "the dark heart of Trump-ghanistan" and plants distinctive, black "Beto" signs wherever she sees too much red. "I had no idea about the goings-on in this country and how much power we relinquished. And how much of a fight we have to go through to get it back."
O'Rourke supporter Amanda Elise Salas, who was Republican until the 2016 presidential campaign, works to register voters in McAllen, facing widespread apathy. Arguing about border policy and the separation of immigrant families, Salas hits a wall with her conservative stepfather, who tells her he'd never vote for a Democrat, because they're all socialists. "That's all there is to it," he says.
"At least he's not yelling," Amanda's mother observes from the adjacent living-room recliner. "You guys usually wind up yelling at each other."
"Because there's a camera here," the stepfather replies.
It's a telling moment about what it was like to actually run with Beto as a golden ideal - the thrilling taste of his charisma, the cameras everywhere that briefly captured his hopeful velocity, against all odds.

Minnesotans helped fund Broadway's hottest show

Texto completo: This wasn't any old coffee mug. It changes color depending upon the temperature of drink -- and it bears the logo of Broadway's hottest new show, "Hadestown."
Twin Cities arts lovers Jennifer Melin Miller, Frances Wilkinson and Christopher Schout cooed over the mug recently at Miller's magazine-ready loft overlooking the Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis. All three are co-producers for "Hadestown," the buzzy new musical that picked up 14 Tony nominations this year -- just two shy of record-holder "Hamilton." Fresh off the delivery truck, the mug was destined for the gift boxes Miller and company were sending to fellow "Hadestown" investors (other goodies include a branded baseball cap, a magnet and a flask).
"The reality is being a producer is glamorous only on opening night," Miller said. "But I love the other, more boring parts."
It takes $8 million to $12 million to bring the typical musical to Broadway. And there's an organizational chart of those who underwrite the big shows, from passive investors (whose contributions run in the thousands) to executive producers who hire and fire talent (they're responsible for raising millions).
Miller, Wilkinson and Schout are partners in Stone Arts Theatricals, formed by Miller in 2016. They acted as more passive investors in recent Broadway shows such as "Waitress," "Come From Away" and "Hello, Dolly!" But "Hadestown" marks their first time as co-producers -- just one notch below executive producer -- giving Stone Arch Theatricals above-the-title billing.
"There are a lot of different reasons to invest in a show, from the magic you feel with the creative team to the producers or an interesting business model," Miller said. "But at the end of the day, the goal is to make money, which is the driver for commercial theater."
Falling for the stage
The late Minnesota businessman and James Binger, who once owned five Broadway playhouses, liked to quip that to end up with a million dollars on Broadway, you need to start with $10 million. The Stone Arch Theatrical trio fuels their pursuits with diverse tastes, expertise -- and resources. Of course, they hesitated to discuss the specifics of their means. (A fourth partner, Wayne Zink, was involved from the beginning. But he was unavailable for interviews due to back surgery.)
Miller grew up in Eagan, the daughter of an accountant mother and a father who built a successful business as a financial services guru. She acted in a Burnsville High School troupe but had no real talent for the stage. "I was a smiler," she said with a laugh.
"But nobody knows her way around a spreadsheet like Jennifer," Schout interjected.
As a youngster, Miller could envision a future only in business. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in business administration, she headed to New York at age 22 for her first job in marketing and media. Evenings and weekends were strictly reserved for the theater.
"I used to live at the TKTS booth," she said of the Times Square vendor specializing in discount tickets. Her first Broadway show was "Miss Saigon." "The music, the performances and that helicopter landing onstage?" she remembered. "They had me."
Miller spent a dozen years in New York -- she worked for the New York Times, Time Inc. and Hearst Magazines. Ambitious and driven, she returned to Minnesota in 2006 to earn graduate degrees in business and public affairs. She later picked up a senior post at Minnetonka Moccasins, the privately held footwear company headed by her husband, David Miller, whose family founded the company in 1946.
Wilkinson grew up in Birmingham, Ala., where her father worked in insurance and real estate. She recalled that her parents took kid-free trips to New York, bringing back cast albums from "My Fair Lady" and other shows they saw.
Wilkinson later lived, worked and studied in London, Tokyo and New York. She recalled seeing Christopher Plummer in a 1971 London production of "Danton's Death" by the renowned director Jonathan Miller. The play is set during the French Revolution, with the Plummer character creating a system to execute people without proof or trial. Eventually, he falls victim to his own method.
"It made my hair stand on my neck," said Wilkinson, a former Guthrie board member who's now on the board of New York's Public Theater. "And if a show does that, that's a good indication that you might want to run with it."
Wilkinson and her husband, Frank (a retired reinsurance executive), are known around the Twin Cities as avid arts supporters. She brings business savvy and sharp dramaturgical instincts to the Stone Arch partnership, Miller said. "Frances has a keen eye for the arc of the story."
A native of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Schout was adopted at age 8 by a middle-class family. His dad owned a market research development firm. "I remember so vividly my parents took me to Fisher Theatre in Detroit to see 'Annie,' " Schout said. "I had just been adopted, so the whole idea of orphans hit home. And at that age, I was fascinated by history, about the Great Depression and the New Deal, and how people were going to live."
The former graphic designer remembered that "the production had conveyor belts to move the people through the city of New York, and I remember thinking, I've got to get to New York someday."
Now all three Stone Arch partners have lived in the Big Apple, where all have maintained pieds- -terre. "I would hop on a plane to anywhere to see theater," Miller said.
High-risk business
Commercial theater is a notoriously high-risk business, with more shows losing money than succeeding. "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" is perhaps the most famous Broadway bomb. Anticipation ran high for the 2011 opening, since the show featured a book by Tony-winning director Julie Taymor and music by Bono and the Edge from U2. But the production lost $60 million, burning producers from coast to coast.
Stone Arch partners have not -- they knocked wood -- lost anything on that order. But their roster of shows includes "Escape to Margaritaville," the Jimmy Buffett musical that rode into New York in 2017 with high expectations before receiving savage reviews.
"The most painful part is when it's not just your loss, but the other people who you've brought on board," Wilkinson said. "Ouch!"
Miller's own production company, North Star Theatricals, has backed a dozen Broadway shows. Her first investment was 2014's "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time."
"I had seen it in London and I told David, 'This is going to be big,' " she recalled. "He wasn't so sure. But on opening night in New York, he turned to me and said, 'I think it's a hit.' "
Stone Arch Theatricals kicked off with an investment in 2016's "Waitress" -- marking a first Broadway venture for married couple Schout and Zink. The show recouped its investment in just four months and is still doing bang-up business on Broadway and on tour.
"Having that as my first Broadway show felt really good," Schout said. "But it's a classic human mistake that's been played out in plays, dramas and books. I expected everything to go like that. But you have to learn to manage your expectations."
Next came investments in "Come From Away" (2017) followed by "The Cher Show" (2018) and "Ain't Too Proud" (2019), the Temptations musical that received a dozen Tony nominations this year. All told, the Stone Arch Theatricals productions have racked up 29 Tony nominations in 2019. The awards will be handed out at New York City's Radio City Music Hall on June 9.
"Basically, we trust our instincts," Miller said of the group's growing roster of shows. "You can spray a ton of money out there, but at the end of the day, you have to love the project."

Iran sanctions are working, but it'll take more to topple regime

Texto completo: President Trump's Iran policy appears to be careening between diplomacy and belligerence. One day Trump tweets, "I'm sure that Iran will want to talk soon." The next he warns that "if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran." Confused? Well, there is a method to the madness.
The Trump administration understands that Iran doesn't want war because Iran knows it will lose. That's why Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear via a government Twitter account "no war is to happen."
Trump's goal is not to start a war. His administration has three objectives: First, restore deterrence and contain Iran's expansionism across the Middle East.
Second, roll back Iran's gains and force it back within its borders.
And third, give Iran's leaders a clear choice: They can come to the negotiating table and give up their nuclear and missile ambitions — or their regime can implode, just like the Soviet Union.
When Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East — in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen — thanks in part to the massive infusions of cash it received from sanctions relief under President Barack Obama's Iran deal.
Trump did not simply restore sanctions imposed before the deal; he ramped them up to unprecedented levels. The sanctions have already "wiped $10 billion from Iranian revenue since November," The Washington Post reported, citing administration officials.
This month, the administration tightened the screws even further, eliminating waivers for eight countries that had previously been allowed to continue importing Iranian oil. The goal, according to American officials, is to reduce Iranian oil exports to "zero." It's working. Bloomberg News reports that "Iran's oil shipments tumbled this month after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers. ... So far, not a single ship has been seen leaving Iran's oil terminals for foreign ports."
The new sanctions are forcing Tehran to cut funds to its terrorist proxies. According to The Post, "Iran's ability to finance allies such as Hezbollah has been curtailed," while in Lebanon, The New York Times reports, "Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed." On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that "Iran's proposed defense budget has been reduced by 25 percent and the [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps'] proposed budget by about 10 percent."
Iran is obviously unhappy with this, and U.S. intelligence saw signs that Iran was preparing to respond with attacks on Americans using terrorist proxies -- just as they did in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and by supplying Shiite militias in Iraq with armor-penetrating roadside bombs that killed hundreds of American soldiers.
So the Trump administration delivered a clear message that America will hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, even if they are carried out by surrogates -- and offered a show of force to back those threats -- providing clarity that makes it less likely Iranian leaders will miscalculate.
Sanctions are inflicting major pain. But if the goal is to roll back Iran's expansionism, then sanctions alone are not enough. We must also aggressively confront Iran throughout the region, building up our allies inflicting defeats on Iran in critical theaters, just as President Ronald Reagan did to the Soviets. A major drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria is incompatible with a "maximum pressure" approach.
Will Iranian leaders come to the table? Far less draconian sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table under Obama. But Trump has rightly paired tougher sanctions with tougher demands. Pompeo has laid out 12 requirements for a deal with Iran — including an end to support for Middle East terrorist groups and a complete withdrawal from Syria — that Iran is unlikely to meet.
If they don't come to the table, then what is our strategy? Does Trump really want to bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime? It's not clear. If he does, then, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Frederick W. Kagan points out, this task may be even harder than it was with the Soviet Union. As North Korea has shown, tyrannical regimes can survive even crippling sanctions.
Certainly, the world will be better if Iran is focused on survival rather than expansion and terror. But it will take more than sanctions to leave the Iranian regime on the ash heap of history. That requires a strategy.

Ben Mezrich catches up with the Winklevii and shifts his take on them

Texto completo: Ben Mezrich first wrote about Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in “Accidental Billionaires," his 2009 book about the twins, Mark Zuckerberg, and others involved in the founding of Facebook. The author had stayed in touch with them sporadically, but had no idea what they'd been up to until a New York Times headline a year and a half ago announced that the brothers had become the first ever Bitcoin billionaires.
Not that Mezrich was looking forward to writing about the popular crypto-currency. “The whole idea — the blockchain — just makes you glaze over," he said. But the Winkelvoss story intrigued him. He began to research. “I dive into my stories," he said. “I became the third Winkelvii twin! I got myself into the world of Bitcoin as much as I could. As I got into it more and more, I started to reassess the characters I had written in 'Accidental Billionaires.' There was much more to them."
In “Bitcoin Billionaires," Mezrich explores the people and ideas behind the crypto-currency, which has fallen from its highest valuation but, he said, is currently climbing back up. “The price of Bitcoin is not indicative of Bitcoin's importance," Mezrich said. “Crypto is the future of money. There's no way that 50 years from now we're going to be paying for things with little slips of paper, bartering like medieval peasants. We're going to be using something digital. We use digital 90 percent of the time to pay for things now."
If Mezrich has re-assessed his portrayal of the Winkelvoss brothers, the same isn't true of his take on Zuckerberg, whose public profile has taken several hits as Facebook has been criticized for political mischief and violation of privacy. “He turned out exactly the way we portrayed him, but reality has kind of caught up," Mezrich said. “I think he always set out to create what is the monster of Facebook today."
Mezrich will read at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Brookline Booksmith.

Texto completo: Not long ago I found myself inside the hushed and high-vaulted interior of a nursing home for geriatric books, in the forgotten city of St.-Omer, France. Running my white-gloved hands over the pages of a thousand-year-old manuscript, I was amazed at the still-bright colors applied long ago in a chilly medieval scriptorium. Would anything written today still be around to touch in another millennium?
In the digital age, the printed book has experienced more than its share of obituaries. Among the most dismissive was from Steve Jobs, who said in 2008, "It doesn't matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don't read anymore."
True, nearly one in four adults in this country have not read a book in the last year. But the book - with a spine, a unique scent, crisp pages and a typeface that may date to Shakespeare's day - is back. Defying all death notices, sales of printed books continue to rise to new highs, as do the number of independent stores stocked with these voices between covers, even as sales of electronic versions are declining.
Nearly three times as many Americans read a book of history in 2017 as watched the first episode of the final season of "Game of Thrones." The share of young adults who read poetry in that year more than doubled from five years earlier. A typical rage tweet by President Donald Trump, misspelled and grammatically sad, may get him 100,000 "likes." Compare that with the 28 million Americans who read a book of verse in the first year of Trump's presidency, the highest share of the population in 15 years.
"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute," wrote Walt Whitman. "We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race."
So, even with a president who is ahistoric, borderline literate and would fail a sixth-grade reading comprehension test, something wonderful and unexpected is happening in the language arts. When the dominant culture goes low, the saviors of our senses go high.
Which brings us to Michelle Obama. You can make a case that we owe a big part of the renaissance of the written word in recent months to her memoir, "Becoming." In the first 15 days after publication last year, it sold enough copies to become the best-selling book in the United States for all of 2018. By the end of March of this year, it had sold 10 million copies and was on pace to become the best-selling memoir ever written in this country.
I was late to her book, having my doubts about platitudinous, focus-group-neutered memoirs by political personalities. As it turned out, she's a luminous, observant, self-aware writer, even if she had some help from a team of ghostwriters. Consider these passages describing her early dance of romance with Barack Obama, when she worked within "the plush stillness" of her Chicago law firm.
"Barack was an ambler. He moved with a loose-jointed Hawaiian casualness, never given to hurry, even and especially when instructed to hurry."
And here is the effect he had on her: "Until now, I'd constructed my existence carefully, tucking and folding every loose and disorderly bit of it, as if building some tight and airless piece of origami." But then, "Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I'd dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good."
This is old-fashioned storytelling, taking us from an upstairs apartment on the South Side of Chicago to the White House. As someone who makes his living in the business of storytelling, I couldn't be happier to see her book smash records and help the printed word amble confidently, like young Barack, through another century.
Storytelling, Steve Jobs may have forgotten, will never die. And the best format for grand and sweeping narratives remains one of the oldest and most durable.

President's bridges to nowhere

Texto completo: By now, we're used to being weirded out by Donald Trump. But the latest meltdown was something special. And it started with ... infrastructure. Who knew?
Stage 1: Trump and the congressional Democratic leaders come to a remarkably easy agreement on a plan to repair roads and bridges, extend broadband service to rural communities and do other basic stuff almost everybody likes.
Stage 2: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are at the White House on Wednesday, waiting for the president to arrive and discuss a plan to raise the money.
Stage 3: Kaboom.
The president walked into the room, declined to take a seat, failed to shake hands with anyone, and announced he was not going to talk about infrastructure while he was under investigation by Democrats.
Trump then stalked into the Rose Garden, where reporters had been assembled, and announced that everything was ruined because he heard Nancy Pelosi say "cover-up."
"Well, it turns out I'm the most - and I think most of you would agree to this - I'm the most transparent president probably in the history of this country," he declared. Fortunately, there was no call for a show of hands.
He then went on a rant that was - you'll never believe this - sort of incoherent. Here's one little taste:
"You heard so much talk about phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like, which is the other side for those that don't know, and for a year I heard about phone calls went to a special number unauthorized and it would have been my son Don, who is a good young man who has gone through hell, and they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting."
Two things. One is that Donald Trump Jr. is a 41-year-old father of five, despite the president's tendency to talk about him in terms that seem to suggest he's doing his sophomore year abroad.
Junior has been pretty much cleared of allegations that he called his dad to brag that he was going to meet with some Russians who had dirt on Hillary Clinton. This appears to be what Trump was referring to in that ... sentence. We will not make any attempt whatsoever to explain why this all popped up during a press conference on infrastructure.
The infrastructure bill was the one thing that the president and the Democratic leaders seemed to think they could really get accomplished. At a chummy meeting last month, the president suggested a $2 trillion deal - more than twice what the Democrats were expecting.
This past week it was time to figure out how to raise the money. Suddenly, Trump went nuts. He was shocked, shocked, shocked to hear that Pelosi had used the word "cover-up" that day in reference to things Congress needed to investigate.
"I don't do cover-ups," he assured the reporters. (We will pause for a moment here while we recall Stormy Daniels.)
Pelosi, who'd been trying to beat back talk of impeachment, was hardly Trump's biggest problem. But on Wednesday her "cover-up" comment was treated as the equivalent of World War III.
What do you think was going on there? Was Trump ...
A) Shocked, shocked to discover Pelosi didn't believe he had been totally forthcoming with Congress?
B) Still seething about the end to "Game of Thrones"?
C) Surprised to discover $2 trillion was actually pretty hard to raise?
Maybe all three. In the very brief time it took the meeting with the Democrats to collapse, Trump's team had managed to set up a lectern with a "NO Collusion, NO Obstruction" sign hanging over the front.
The president then told the assembled media that the investigation into his Russia relationships was a "total, horrible thing that happened to our country" and that there could be no discussion of roads or bridges while Congress was poking around his administration.
"I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it," he said to the invisible Democratic leaders from the Rose Garden. "I'd be really good at that."
We will stop here for a minute to recall, just for the heck of it, that in Trump's "Art of the Deal" era he was so good at building that he managed to lose more than twice as much money as any other American taxpayer.
During his Rose Garden performance, the president once again fell into the extremely creepy habit of referring to himself in the third person. ("They hated President Trump. They hated him with a passion.")
He also began calling impeachment "the I-word," which can be very confusing on what was supposed to be Infrastructure Day.
"Whether or not they carry the big I-word out ... when you look at all I've done ..." he rambled on, marching into the bog of self-pity, stopping to admire his many fictional accomplishments. ("Largest tax cut in the history of the country.")
By the end of the day, Pelosi seemed to be flirting with the I-word herself for the first time. And the infrastructure plan sank slowly into the horizon.
Farewell, poor bill. And if you're driving anywhere this weekend, remember the P-word is pothole.

Arpaio seeks funds to aid SEAL accused of war crimes

Texto completo: Even as his own criminal case remains tied up in court, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is urging donations to help a Navy SEAL charged with shooting civilians in Iraq and murdering a suspected member of ISIS.
Arpaio is framing the plight of Eddie Gallagher as "an American hero" who "could go to prison for the rest of his life over false charges that are based on lies and half-truths," as he put it in a fundraising email this week.
"I know what it's like to have people with an agenda come after you for doing your job to serve your country," Arpaio wrote, alluding to his 2017 criminal contempt of court conviction.
The fundraising pitch comes as President Donald Trump has reportedly filed paperwork on an expedited basis suggesting a forthcoming pardon for Gallagher and other members of the military facing charges of war crimes.
Gallagher is scheduled to stand trial on charges supported in part by fellow Navy SEALs.
Some of those who served with Gallagher said he "indiscriminately shot at civilians, gunning down a young woman in a flowered hijab and an unarmed old man. They also said he stabbed a teenage captive, then bragged about it in text messages," according to an account of his actions in the New York Times.
Arpaio is asking for tax-deductible donations to the National Center for Police Defense, a nonprofit that claims to help law enforcement officers in court. The organization spent more than $500,000 helping Arpaio's legal defense.
It's part of an effort to clear Gallagher and other service members by conservatives, including U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who is under indictment on charges of misusing campaign funds for personal expenses and lying to the Federal Election Commission.
Trump's first pardon went to Arpaio in 2017, ruling out any punishment for the former six-term sheriff.
Arpaio is still trying to contest his conviction. A special prosecutor maintains Arpaio acknowledged his conviction by accepting the pardon.
"No member of our Armed Forces deserves the kind of treatment Eddie Gallagher has received, especially those like him who have fought on the front lines and put their lives on the line countless times for our freedom and security," Arpaio said in his fundraising appeal. "But there are those who want to see Chief Gallagher put behind bars, so they've spun a web of lies to satisfy their agenda to put him away."
Others see the case, and Trump's potential pardon, as undermining the U.S. abroad.
"Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us," wrote Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under then-President Barack Obama.

A Nice Problem To Have: 2 Teams, 2 Important Games

Texto completo: When Wes Edens met the lifelong Aston Villa fan who would soon become the head coach to steer Villa where it sits now -- one win short of a return to the Premier League -- Edens's new acquaintance extended his hand and said, "Hi, I'm Dean Smith."
"No, you're not," Edens shot back.
Coming from the world of basketball, as a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, Edens, who is also the American co-owner of Aston Villa in English soccer, told him there was only one "real Dean Smith." Edens then asked "the other Dean Smith," as he likes to refer to the Villa manager, to pull out his phone and do a search on the former University of North Carolina basketball coach.
"He didn't know who our Dean Smith was," Edens said this week in a telephone interview. "We joke about that now."
Edens relished sharing a humorous anecdote, with laughs suddenly scarce amid the alternating spells of exhilaration and angst dribbling around his head. The Bucks' 105-99 home loss Thursday night to the Toronto Raptors abruptly transformed what would have been the most complicated scenario of Edens's sporting life -- both of the sports franchises he owns playing for major prizes on the same day but on different continents -- into the scenario he has to root for now.
On Monday afternoon, at Wembley Stadium in London, Aston Villa plays Derby County in the winner-take-all Championship playoff final, which sends the victor to the opulence of the Premier League while consigning the loser to another season in the unglamorous second tier of English football. It is routinely described as the single most lucrative soccer game in the world; most estimates peg the value at roughly $ 200 million next season to the team that gains promotion.
On Monday night in Milwaukee, Edens's Bucks can still host Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals -- but only if they win Game 6 in Toronto on Saturday night. The Bucks' first three-game losing streak all season, after a largely storybook campaign inspired by the Greek superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, has forced Edens to hold out for a daunting road win that keeps Milwaukee's season going -- even though it is likely to force him to make an unappetizing choice.
Despite owning a private jet and the cushion of a five-hour time difference, Edens knows that making his maiden trip to Wembley would almost certainly prevent him from getting back to Wisconsin in time to see what would be the biggest game in Bucks history since their last trip to the N.B.A. finals with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1974.
The privilege to make such a call, of course, would naturally be preferable to a loss in Canada that would eliminate the top-seeded Bucks -- this season's only 60-win team in the N.B.A. -- and send the Raptors into a championship matchup against the mighty Golden State Warriors instead.
"It is a lot of stress," Edens said. "But this could truly be a unique circumstance in my life, where you have two teams deep in the playoffs with massive consequences on either side of it -- that's kind of what you're hoping for. While I'm definitely anxious about it, I'm also incredibly happy to have the chance to be here."
Edens and Marc Lasry are in their fifth year as owners of the Bucks. The "hedge fund titans," as they were described in a New York Times headline when they bought the team in April 2014, took control of the franchise, along with a third owner, Jamie Dinan, after a 15-67 record in Antetokounmpo's rookie season. Antetokounmpo averaged a modest 6.8 points and 4.4 rebounds a game -- and championship contention looked far-off.
Edens, whose interest in soccer began with the 1994 World Cup in the United States, and Nassef Sawiris, his Egyptian co-owner at Aston Villa, became the club's majority shareholders in July 2018, mere days before the start of this season and not even two months removed from Villa's crushing 1-0 defeat to Fulham in last season's Championship playoff final at Wembley. Villa was in 15th place, heading for the bottom third of the 24-team Championship division on Oct. 3, when Edens and Sawiris sacked the veteran manager Steve Bruce and replaced him with Smith.
In the Bucks' case, Edens is convinced it was the hiring of Mike Budenholzer as coach in May 2018 -- to team with General Manager Jon Horst and the team president Peter Feigin -- that provided Antetokounmpo with the blueprint and infrastructure he needed to make the most of his otherworldly gifts in his sixth N.B.A. season. Edens has pushed to copy the formula with Villa through the hiring of Smith, Christian Purslow as chief executive and Jesús García Pitarch as sporting director (English soccer's answer to a general manager).
"Nassef and Christian, I've taken a back seat to those guys," said Edens, who shares operating control of Aston Villa with the London-based Sawiris but spends much less time in England.
With Antetokounmpo flanked by 3-point shooters in shiny new Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee is on the rise in the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference and still getting acquainted with its growing prominence. One example: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers took in Milwaukee's Game 5 defeat from one of Edens's floor seats.
Aston Villa, by contrast, is a fallen English giant from the second-biggest city in the country (Birmingham). Champions of Europe in 1982, in the days before the European Cup became the Champions League, Villa tumbled out of the Premier League in 2016 after nearly three decades in England's top flight.
A chilly welcome for Edens would not have been surprising, given the former Cleveland Browns owner Randy Lerner's disappointing 10-year tenure as the Villa chairman from 2006 to 2016. But Edens has thus far dodged the usual suspicion and rancor from English soccer fans that often greet American owners, largely because he and Sawiris bought out the Chinese businessman Tony Xia, whose approval rating in two seasons sank to Lerner levels.
Another factor: Aston Villa fans were recently treated to a 10-match winning streak, longest in the club's 144-year history, which vaulted Villa into the four-team playoffs for the third and final promotion spot to the Premier League. The British broadcaster Jonny Gould, who doubles as director of the Aston Villa Supporters Trust, asserts that Edens and Sawiris have ushered in "a decade's worth of improvements in 10 months."
"They have taken us from certain double relegation, bankruptcy and easy pickings for other clubs to take our best players to stand on the edge of an unlikely return to the big time," Gould said Thursday. "The fun, inspiration and good times are back at Villa Park after a decade of decline and slumber."
Reviews of Bucks ownership are also on the rebound. In the 2017 off-season, the elevation of Horst to general manager was portrayed as a compromise of three controlling partners who could not agree on an external hire. Of the three, only Edens attended Horst's introductory news conference. Two years later, at age 36, Horst is a contender for N.B.A. executive of the year.
"I'm not the kind of person who says, 'I told you so,"' Edens said. "That's not how I spend my life. But I feel really good that the decisions we've made around him turned out the way they did."
On Friday, Edens was just focused on trying to work out whether he should fly from Toronto to England on Sunday, or settle for arranging a soccer watch party on Monday morning in Milwaukee, if the Bucks find a way to force that Game 7.
"One of the other owners told me, 'No one's going to feel sorry for us,"' Edens said. "There's no sympathy out there, because it's a wonderful position to be in."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — ABC announced Thursday that Nik Wallenda and his sister, Lijana, will cross Times Square during a 1,300-foot simultaneous highwire walk 25 stories above the ground. ABC will air the attempt during a two-hour prime-time special on June 23.

It will be Lijana Wallenda's first highwire walk since a 2017 accident in Florida left her and four other members of the family's troupe seriously injured. The Times Square walk will involve unspecified safety devices, but organizers say it does not eliminate all risks.

ABC says the siblings will start from opposite ends of the wire, which will be suspended between two of Times Square's towers, including one that is home to The New York Times .

Nik Wallenda said in a statement: "I am beyond excited to be able to walk with my sister, Lijana, as she overcomes near-death injuries and continues the Wallenda tradition of never giving up."

His feats have included a 1,800-foot tightrope walk from the New York side of Niagara Falls into Canada in 2012, and a 2013 crossing of the Little Colorado River Gorge near the Grand Canyon.

Rush awarded $2M for defamation SYDNEY — Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush was awarded an Australian record of 2.9 million Australian dollars ($2 million) damages by a Sydney judge Thursday in a defamation case against a newspaper publisher and journalist over reports that he had been accused of inappropriate behavior toward an actress.

The 67-year-old Australian had sued Sydney's The Daily Telegraph 's publisher and journalist Jonathon Moran in the Federal Court over two stories and a poster published in late 2017.

Justice Michael Wigney found in April the publisher, News Corp.-owned Nationwide News, and Moran were reckless regarding the truth when they reported Rush had been accused of inappropriate behavior by actress Eryn Jean Norvill. She played the daughter of Rush's character in a Sydney theater production of "King Lear" in 2015 and 2016.

The judge found a poster and two articles contained several defamatory meanings, including that Rush was a pervert and a sexual predator, but the publisher had not proven the meanings were true.

Rush won the best actor Oscar in 1996 for his portrayal of pianist David Helfgott in "Shine" and was nominated for roles in "Shakespeare In Love," "'Quills" and "The King's Speech." He is also famed for his portrayal of Captain Barbossa in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films.

Lange to remain behind bars until hearing NEWARK, N.J. — Authorities say a court hearing has not yet been scheduled for comedian Artie Lange after his arrest on a charge of having failed to comply with his court-ordered drug program.

The Essex County sheriff says Lange was arrested Tuesday morning at a halfway house on an unspecified violation. Sheriff Armando Fontoura told NJ.com that Lange, 51, would remain at the county jail until he is called before a judge for reevaluation. Lange spent almost a week in the county jail earlier this year after a positive drug test. He was placed on probation last year after pleading guilty to heroin possession stemming.

The 51-year-old was on the Fox sketch comedy series "Mad TV" and was a longtime co-host on "The Howard Stern Show."

Mario Batali: A brief bio

Texto completo: Celebrity chef Mario Batali, who has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple women, is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Boston on charges that he groped and kissed a woman in a Back Bay restaurant two years ago. It appears to be the first criminal charge to arise from the series of allegations.
When Eater first broke the news in 2017 that several women had accused Batali of misconduct, Batali confessed that “much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up" to how he acted. After three additional women accused Batali of assaulting or raping them, The New York Times reported that two of the cases couldn't be tried because they were outside of that state's statute of limitations, and there was not enough evidence for legal action on the third allegation.
Here is a look at Batali's rise and fall.
■ Batali, 58, grew up in Seattle and spent his childhood watching his grandmother make Italian specialties passed down in the family, according to a PBS bio. He graduated from Rutgers University and studied at Le Cordon Bleu, the famous culinary school, in London, before dropping out. Next up: a three-year apprenticeship at a restaurant in an Italian village.
■ In his heyday, Batali owned restaurants around the world through his company, the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group. They included flashy spaces like Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca on the South Boston waterfront, Batali's first Boston-area restaurant.
His culinary focus was on Italian culture and cuisine. After the allegations broke, Grub Street reported that Batali's restaurant empire lost almost 30 percent of its business. Batali eventually released his ownership stake in the group. 
Batali was also a minority owner of Eataly, an Italian culinary marketplace with a location in Boston. The complexes combine a mix of dining, shopping, and learning elements. Batali sold his ownership after the sexual assault allegations surfaced. Eataly also removed Batali's products from stores.
■ Batali's fame came from his TV work, including a cohosting gig on ABC's “The Chew" spanning more than 1,000 episodes, per Eater. The series follows a daytime talk show format but with a food focus. Batali stepped back from the show amid the allegations in 2017 and was later fired by ABC.
Prior to joining “The Chew," Batali hosted several culinary tour shows on the Food Network, including “Molto Mario," “Mediterranean Mario," “Mario Eats Italy," and “Ciao America with Chef Mario Batali." Batali was also a part of the network's “Iron Chef" competition franchise.
■ Batali is known for his devotion to orange Croc footwear. In an interview with Details, he said he purchased 200 pairs of the signature clogs when he heard they'd be discontinued. Batali even teamed up with Crocs to create a “Bistro Mario Batali Vent Clog," but the partnership was terminated in March 2017.

Texto completo: Described by Variety as " 'Superman' meets 'The Omen,' " " Brightburn " is the story of an alien child (Jackson A. Dunn) who crash-lands on Earth but turns out to be evil rather than heroic. Variety call the film, which also stars Elizabeth Banks and David Denman as the boy's foster parents, a "watchable but super-silly mix of superheroics and evil-child horror that mashes together singularly uninspired ideas from both." R. At area theaters. Contains violence, bloody images and crude language. 91 minutes.

In the French thriller " My Son ," a man (Guillaume Canet) becomes distraught when his 7-year-old son disappears from a camping trip, and he starts to suspect the boyfriend (Olivier de Benoist) of his estranged wife (Mélanie Laurent). The New York Times says the film is "so reserved in its storytelling and vague in its details that all it elicits is a yawn." Unrated. At Landmark's West End Cinema. In French with subtitles. 84 minutes.

What are Trump’s tax returns hiding?

Texto completo: When you look at the short span of President Trump’s political career, one question jumps out: How much of his craziest, most paranoid and norm-violating behavior is motivated by a desire to keep his financial arrangements secret?
It began with Trump’s bizarre refusal to release his tax returns, in defiance of both a nearly half-century practice and Trump’s own promise that he’d do so.
Then there was his refusal to divest from his sprawling multinational empire, or even put it into a blind trust -- either of which would have forced at least some information disclosure to a third party.
There were also the interviews and tweetstorms calling journalists who report on his finances “enemies of the people,” and suggestions that federal officials who audit him are anti-Christian.
As well as his implicit threat in 2017 that he would fire special counsel Robert Mueller if he crossed a “red line” by examining Trump’s personal financial dealings.
Also, his curious personnel priorities. Once it became clear that House Democrats would exercise their explicit statutory authority to get Trump’s tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, Trump asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to prioritize confirmation of Trump’s IRS general counsel nominee ahead of confirmation of a new attorney general. This IRS general counsel pick, mind you, also happened to have previously advised the Trump Organization on tax issues.
Trump’s treasury secretary has also been spending so much time safeguarding Trump’s tax returns, in violation of that explicit statute, that the activity is reportedly crowding out his day job.
All of which raises the question: Why exactly is Trump (and the rest of his administration) expending so much energy and political capital to keep these documents hidden? What could possibly be so disturbing or incriminating to justify such an effort?
One theory is that, maybe, if Trump’s tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he’s not nearly as rich as he says. Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up.
Of course, both explanations could be true.
Thanks to dogged reporting from The New York Times, we know that Trump lost more than $1 billion over a decade beginning in 1985, more than nearly any other taxpayer in the country. We know that he inherited a fortune from his father -- including through legally questionable tax dodges -- but frittered much of that fortune away.
We also know, thanks to other matters of public record -- including testimony from the president’s own former attorney, as well as a sworn deposition from Trump himself -- that Trump has inflated his net worth when it suited him.
So yes, whatever information Trump’s financial documents reveal about his actual net worth could potentially undermine the core tenet of his sales pitch to his voters.
But what he might be a wee bit more worried about relates to the other red flags raised over the years.
Issues such as: Why international transactions involving multiple Deutsche Bank accounts controlled by Trump set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect money laundering and other financial crimes, as the Times reported Sunday.
Or why Trump purchased a house for $40 million and flipped it for more than twice that amount in a sale to a Russian oligarch, another transaction that might raise suspicions of money laundering.
Or why, about a decade ago, the self-proclaimed “King of Debt” suddenly began making huge, all-cash real estate purchases, including of money-losing golf courses. Debt is highly tax-advantaged in real estate finance. The fact that Trump went on a cash spending spree while interest rates were near zero is fishy at best.
Not least because a golf reporter said Trump’s son Eric told him that the organization wasn’t borrowing from banks because it had “all the funding we need out of Russia.” (Eric Trump later denied making the statement.)
We don’t know what Trump is working so hard to hide, but we have a lot of hints. They’re all troubling. Which is precisely why it’s so important that Congress -- as part of its constitutionally mandated oversight duties -- conduct a forensic audit of Trump’s worldwide financial dealings.
That means learning whom he’s been getting money from, whom he owes money to, and what individuals or entities could be using financial influence to exert pressure over policy.
Almost as troubling as whatever it is Trump is trying to hide: Why do all those supposed national security hawks in Trump’s party exhibit so little curiosity about the answers?

Avenatti Is Charged With Stealing From Client

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti with misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars belonging to a former client, the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.
The indictment, announced by the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan, marks the disintegration of a relationship that propelled Mr. Avenatti to national prominence and adds to his mountain of legal troubles as he stands accused of more than three dozen crimes in California and New York.
Mr. Avenatti is accused of taking more than $ 295,000 from Ms. Daniels, who is named in the indictment as "Victim-1" and was identified as the actress by a person with knowledge of the case.
After helping her secure a book contract last year, according to the charges, Mr. Avenatti sent "a fraudulent and unauthorized letter" bearing Ms. Daniels's signature to her literary agent, demanding that a portion of the book advance be wired to a client trust account he controlled.
Mr. Avenatti is accused of putting the money toward his personal expenses, including plane tickets, hotel stays, meal delivery, dry cleaning and a monthly payment on a Ferrari.
Mr. Avenatti denied all of the charges against him on Wednesday and said he looked forward to fighting them in court.
"At no time was any money misappropriated or mishandled," he told The New York Times, saying that any funds related to the book were part of his representation agreement.
"She received millions of dollars worth of legal services, and we spent huge sums in expenses," he added, referring to Ms. Daniels, whom he said he had not represented since February. "She directly paid only $ 100 for all that she received."
Ms. Daniels -- whose memoir, "Full Disclosure," was published by St. Martin's Press last year -- could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Prosecutors said she "had not signed or authorized the letter" to her agent and "did not even know of its existence." Mr. Avenatti tried to conceal the effort by advancing money to her "from another source" to stand in for one installment, prosecutors said, and he falsely said the publisher had not paid when she asked about another portion.
Mr. Avenatti drew national attention when he began representing Ms. Daniels in early 2018, filing lawsuits against President Trump and Michael D. Cohen, the president's former lawyer and fixer. He sought to release Ms. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, from a hush agreement she had signed before the 2016 election. As part of that deal, she accepted $ 130,000 and agreed to keep quiet about a sexual relationship she said she had had with Mr. Trump in 2006.
Both of the lawsuits Mr. Avenatti filed on behalf of Ms. Daniels were dismissed, and in one case she was ordered to pay Mr. Trump $ 293,000 in legal fees.
Yet Ms. Daniels's story created further trouble for the president, culminating in Mr. Cohen's guilty plea last year to campaign finance crimes related to the hush payment. This month, he began serving a three-year prison sentence. The same office that won Mr. Cohen's guilty plea -- the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York -- filed the new charges against Mr. Avenatti, which included aggravated identity theft.
The new charges add to numerous others filed this year. Mr. Avenatti was arrested in New York in March on extortion charges, accused of seeking millions from Nike in exchange for what he described as evidence of misconduct by company employees in the recruitment of college basketball players. On Wednesday, he was also indicted on those previously announced charges.
In a separate indictment filed in California this spring, Mr. Avenatti was accused of stealing millions of dollars from five other clients, one of them a paraplegic man who had won a $ 4 million settlement but received only a fraction of that in periodic payments that never exceeded $ 1,900. Mr. Avenatti was also accused of filing fake tax returns to a Mississippi bank, and of lying repeatedly about his business and income to an agent of the Internal Revenue Service, creditors, a bankruptcy court and a bankruptcy trustee.
Mr. Avenatti, who spent much of 2018 crusading against Mr. Trump on cable news shows and teasing a presidential run of his own, has called the cases against him politically motivated.
But federal prosecutors in California said their indictment had grown out of a criminal investigation initiated in September 2016, months before the election that would catapult both him and his future client, Ms. Daniels, into the political arena.
"He blatantly lied to and stole from his client to maintain his extravagant lifestyle," Geoffrey S. Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said in a statement on Wednesday. "Michael Avenatti abused and violated the core duty of an attorney -- the duty to his client."
If convicted on all of the charges pending against him, Mr. Avenatti could face more than 300 years in prison.

Texto completo: Anita Hill, whose treatment during Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing has become an issue in the 2020 campaign, said she worries that the Democratic women in the race "are not being taken seriously as presidential candidates."
"And I think if we don't take them seriously as presidential candidates, we are not going to hear those voices," she said Tuesday night in an interview. "And that would be a tragedy."
Ms. Hill's testimony in the Thomas hearings and the hostile questioning she faced from an all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee has led to questions this year about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is leading in early polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, and criticisms that he allowed Ms. Hill to be treated poorly as the committee's chairman.
More than a quarter-century later, Ms. Hill said she finds it "really, deeply troubling" that several of the female 2020 candidates have been discussed as vice presidential material. Both Senator Kamala Harris of California and Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor last year, have been mentioned as possible running mates for Mr. Biden over the past few months. The Biden campaign team has been adamant that the speculation does not come from them.
Ms. Harris, a presidential candidate, has laughed off the idea, saying last week, "I think that Joe Biden would be a great running mate." Ms. Abrams, who has not yet decided whether she will run, has said, "you don't run for second place." Ms. Abrams's former campaign manager also said in March that "there was no grand plan hatched" about a joint ticket with Mr. Biden.
Other male candidates, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, have suggested that they would pick a woman as their vice president if they won the nomination.

Asked whether she was directing her comments at Mr. Biden, Ms. Hill replied: "I don't know that it's just him. I think that that presumption about women as vice-presidential choices is not just about Joe Biden specifically, it's about Joe Biden as the front-runner."
Asked if she personally considers Mr. Biden the front-runner, she replied, "He's leading in the polls."
Mr. Biden spoke with Ms. Hill by telephone shortly before he announced his presidential bid, expressing regret for "what she endured" and detailing his admiration for her, his campaign said at the time. But Ms. Hill told The New York Times last month that she was unsatisfied with his message.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,"' she said at the time. "I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose."
Asked on Tuesday what progress she had seen on that front, Ms. Hill stressed that she wanted to see all of the candidates support victims of sexual harassment and assault.
"I don't know that the Biden campaign is addressing the issue directly, so I can't say I've seen any," she said. "I'm not even saying that Biden has to be the one to do it, or the only one to do it. I would really like to see all of the candidates address this issue."
Mr. Biden, for his part, has been heavily involved in an anti-campus sexual assault program called It's on Us, and he played a leading role in shepherding the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. He continues to discuss the importance of those issues on the campaign trail. But Ms. Hill, who called the Violence Against Women Act "wonderful" and "so important," said there was more work to do.
Ms. Hill spoke to The Times on Tuesday ahead of the PEN America Literary Gala and Free Expression Awards in New York, where she was presented with an award. At the gala, she reflected on her appearance before the Senate committee.
"In 1991, under the glare of intense political and media scrutiny, I shared more of what it is -- the whole experience, the entirety of the experience of being a woman," she said. "But I was also sharing the experience of what it's like to be black. And finally, to be a black woman facing sexual harassment."
She went on to stress that, given the chance to testify all over again, she would.
"I, today, am here to say that I have my voice," she said.

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that's not what we're getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, "I hope not," to a reporter's shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he's not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U.S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran's nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There's no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran "conform to the normal things that normal nations do," Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn't believe this himself. "I just don't see it," the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump's other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn't worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U.S.-led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U.S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a "deal" to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan?
Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can't convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.

Vanity, altruism in sharp contrast

Texto completo: On this side, art dealer and former Goldman Sachs executive Robert Mnuchin, who just spent $91 million of a client's money on a stainless-steel statuette of a rabbit.
On that side, billionaire private equity investor Robert F. Smith, who just announced to the graduating class of nearly 400 at the historically black Morehouse College that he would cover their student debt, at an estimated cost of $40 million.
If you're counting, the buyer of the Jeff Koons artwork could have made two gestures equivalent to Smith's, and had $11 million left over.

We reported on the art purchase last week. To recap, Mnuchin placed the winning bid of $91.1 million at a Christie's auction May 15 for the statuette crafted by Koons, an artist known for his appeal to a market driven by plutocratic philistines with, arguably, more money than taste. News of the action by Smith, who has been identified by Forbes as the nation's richest African American ($4.4 billion in net worth), came over the weekend.
Mnuchin, who is the father of Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, has said he didn't buy the Koons statuette for his own collection. He hasn't revealed the buyer, but among the suspects is hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen, an active participant in the high-end art market, who also isn't talking. The seller was the estate of the late billionaire media mogul S.I. Newhouse.
Our suggestion that the May 15 auction -- indeed, the multibillion-dollar art market generally -- justified proposals for putting a leash on big fortunes, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren's idea for a wealth tax, produced a certain pushback from libertarians grousing about government "confiscation" and infringement of the freedom to waste one's wealth on a whim. Warren (D-Mass.) calls for a tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and an additional 1% on net worth above $1 billion, which doesn't sound like much of a confiscatory burden. She also calls for enhancing government support for historically black colleges, such as Morehouse.
But the contrasting investments represented by the Smith and Mnuchin expenditures also point to some issues about billionaire philanthropy that warrant scrutiny.
It's proper to acknowledge that spending millions on art of dubious intrinsic value isn't incompatible with donating to worthy social causes. Cohen is credited with tens of millions of dollars in contributions to health and educational institutions, for example.
Other billionaires have made their mark with notable contributions for improved public access to art and cultural artifacts. Hedge fund promoter Stephen A. Schwarzman announced a $100-million donation to the New York Public Library in 2008, in return for which he got the system's landmark main building on 42nd Street rechristened in his name. Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad has opened his art collection to public viewing via the Broad museum on Bunker Hill, to which admission is free. The Getty Museum also is free.
No one should begrudge these donors the honor of having their names associated with their largess. But no one should forget that some of their contribution is billed to the general public, via the tax deduction they receive for philanthropic donations. Unlike the federal income tax deductions for state and local taxes, charitable deductions weren't capped by the tax cut enacted by Republicans in December 2017, most of which went into the pockets of the 1%.
The issue with mega-donations that seldom gets discussed is whether some are worthier of the tax deduction than others. Consider contributions to university endowments. These are invariably treated as public boons (except perhaps when they come with ideological strings attached, as is the case with contributions from people like the Koch brothers).
Yet in many cases they only make the rich richer. In 2016, Nike founder Phil Knight announced a $400-million gift to Stanford University, which was then the nation's fifth-richest university; in 2018 it was ranked fourth, with an endowment of $24.8 billion.
As we wrote at the time, assuming that Knight paid the top marginal federal tax rate on his income, the donation then gave him a tax break worth $158 million -- that's an invoice paid by the U.S. taxpayer. Then and now, however, public universities such as the University of California were being starved of resources.
Other high-profile donations really look like billionaires' donations to themselves, albeit well-disguised. Economic commentator Felix Salmon blew the whistle in 2012 on hedge fund billionaire John Paulson's $100-million donation to the Central Park Conservancy, which nurtures a park just a few steps from his town house.
"If you wanted to give $100 million to charity while making the barest minimum impact on the world, you'd be hard pushed to improve on Paulson's performance," Salmon wrote. The donation got Paulson, one of a class of financiers whose image was sullied by the financial crisis, breathless praise from the New York Times.
What makes Smith's philanthropic act appear to stand apart is that it seems selfless. Many of the 400 beneficiaries of his donation come from families that have struggled to pay the bills for their education.
Smith received nationwide acclaim for his act, which he announced at the Morehouse commencement Sunday, where he was the commencement speaker, but it's not like he'll be taking a trophy home for his personal gallery like the buyer of the Koons statuette. The gift also seems to fit with Smith's general approach to philanthropy, which has focused on human rights, support for black cultural institutions, and healthcare and educational opportunities for minority Americans.
Smith is addressing a problem, the burden of student debt, that government seems unwilling or unable to fix. If Smith takes a tax deduction for his gift, it's in the nature of a charge to federal taxpayers for something they should be paying for anyway. If the U.S. had a sensible system of paying for higher education, he wouldn't have to spend $40 million helping a few hundred needy students, and he'd be able to devote that sum to some other endeavor. The evidence suggests that it wouldn't be on a polished figure of stainless steel.

Trump's My Lai moment

Texto completo: If indeed President Trump pardons one or more U.S. military men accused or convicted of war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq, it could be his most Nixonian moment yet.
On March 29, 1971, a U.S. Army court-martial at Fort Benning, Ga., convicted Lt. William Calley of 22 murders for his part in the massacre of as many as 500 men, women and children by a company of U.S. soldiers at My Lai, Vietnam. The tribunal sentenced him to life in prison.
President Richard M. Nixon did not see this as an opportunity to drive home the point that U.S. soldiers must follow the laws of war and that deviations are not only morally wrong but counterproductive militarily.
Rather, Nixon decided to exploit a groundswell of sympathy for Calley. In 1971, millions of Americans vilified Calley as typical of a corrupt and violent policy; yet millions more saw him as a dedicated soldier being scapegoated for the failed policies of others.
A song called "Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley" sold more than 200,000 records in the three days after the court-martial ended. "My name is William Calley, I'm a soldier of this land," the lyrics went. "I've tried to do my duty and to gain the upper hand. But they've made me out a villain; they have stamped me with a brand."
Within days of Calley's conviction, Nixon exercised his authority to have him removed from prison and placed in comfortable house arrest pending an appeal, the first step in a process that would ultimately see Calley, the only American convicted for the atrocities at My Lai, set free after three years.
Now, as in Nixon's era, executive clemency may undercut the results of legal process - but resonate on the populist right. Trump is in touch with the same distrust of elite authority that Nixon was, and taps the same vein of sympathy for men sent to fight a dirty guerrilla war in which, as "Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley" put it, "It's hard to judge the enemy and hard to tell the good."
Where Trump may break new ground, according to a recent New York Times report, would be by weighing a pardon for one Navy SEAL accused of murder - before he even stands trial.
Edward Gallagher faces a May 28 court-martial on criminal counts including premeditated murder for allegedly stabbing to death a suspected Islamic State fighter whom Iraqi forces had brought for medical care to Gallagher's SEAL team platoon in Mosul in May 2017. Gallagher, a 19-year veteran of multiple combat tours, also stands accused of firing at civilians indiscriminately, and, in one alleged instance, shot a girl walking along a riverbank.
Gallagher denies the charges and, with the support of more than three dozen Republican members of Congress, began demanding less restrictive pretrial confinement almost as soon as he was arrested last September. Trump granted that demand in March.
The campaign on Gallagher's behalf is smaller in scale than the one waged by Calley's supporters long ago, but similar in spirit.
His leading defender, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), has said the military justice system is "rigged" and that Gallagher deserves presidential intervention if convicted.
Gallagher's lawyers argue that his accusers - fellow Navy SEALs - are motivated by resentment at his demanding leadership style.
Navy prosecutors argue that, to the contrary, Gallagher's accusers showed "the courage and integrity to come forward and report" his wrongdoing, as Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak said in a pretrial hearing last November.
This assertion gains plausibility from the fact that the SEALs are a famously self-protective elite force not given to challenging one another's wartime conduct lightly, though of course Gallagher is entitled to a presumption of innocence and the right to challenge testimony against him.
Perhaps, though, the SEALs' willingness to blow the whistle reflected the U.S. military's embrace, since My Lai, of the standard set by Hugh Thompson, a U.S. Army helicopter pilot who was at the village on March 16, 1968, saw what was happening and intervened to save a group of civilian Vietnamese, ordering his crew to fire on U.S. troops if necessary to stop the slaughter.
In 1998, the Army held a special ceremony to present Thompson the Soldier's Medal - an award for heroism not involving conflict with an enemy. This belated recognition of a man who was, in 1968, ostracized for his stand, fit into the armed forces' broader effort to reinforce ethical and humanitarian standards. Thompson even spoke at West Point and other military installations.
Hugh Thompson's legacy, in short, was taking hold; but now the commander in chief himself may be about to repudiate it.

A chance meeting with Akihito

Texto completo: Late last month, Japan's emperor Akihito abdicated his supreme office because of increasing ill health. Thus ends his 30-year reign on the Chrysanthemum Throne, the world's oldest continuing monarchy.
I had the good fortune to meet Akihito more than 60 years ago at Haverford College at the beginning of my senior year. It was Sept. 15, 1953, and the 19-year old crown prince was in the United States en route home after representing his country at the coronation in Westminster Abbey of Queen Elizabeth II. My job was to welcome Akihito on behalf of Haverford's student body. It was a perfunctory duty, perfunctorily performed. But for me it was a tiny tug at history's sleeve.
For Akihito, the visit was not only a welcome respite from the relentless ceremonies of an international tour. It was his joyful reunion with two dear friends. One was his former tutor for four years in post-war Japan, Elizabeth Gray Vining - the author of many books for young readers and the catalyst for Akihito's visit to our Quaker campus. (Their friendship continued after Akihito became emperor in 1989 and lasted throughout Vining's life.) The other was Haverford sophomore Robert Togasaki, his former classmate at a Japanese private middle school and a fellow pupil of Vining's.
A reporter covering the Crown Prince's tour for Philadelphia's The Evening Bulletin noted that he "broke into a sunny smile" when he saw Mr. Togasaki. And Mr. Togasaki, later a professor of biology at Indiana University, told me several years ago that a high point of his day was the long walk they took together, speaking Japanese.
The Evening Bulletin provides additional details of the Crown Prince's visit: He was eager to see the duck pond where, he was told, freshmen "got a hazing." He stood on the sidelines of Walton Field to watch football practice and was forced to dodge a husky lineman in pursuit of an errant punt. He attended a philosophy seminar and ate in the dining hall with a group of students, faculty and Haverford's president. He was fascinated, The Evening Bulletin reported, when he "saw for the first time an automatic soft drink dispensing machine. He put a coin in, got a cool drink and, grinning happily, presented it to a friend."
The Crown Prince's Haverford visit was a resounding success. As The Evening Bulletin noted, "Observers thought the 19-year old heir to the imperial throne felt more relaxed among the youthful students than he had seemed to be on ceremonial occasions and educational tours."
A postscript: There was another visitor of special note that semester. His signature is on the same page of the 1953 guest book at the Haverford library's Quaker & Special Collections unit, seven lines below Akihito's. On Oct. 19, Glenn T. Seaborg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, was on campus as part of a Haverford program that brought persons distinguished in the arts, sciences and public service to teach and otherwise interact with the student body.
Seaborg had worked on the wartime Manhattan Project that developed the bombs that obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki and surely terrified 11-year old Akihito, then in hiding with the royal family in the countryside.
One would suppose that the careers of these two signatories, ironically linked in that guest book, would be wholly disparate. But as befits invitees to a campus rooted in Quaker pacifism, each was a strong advocate for peace.
Before the bombs were dropped, Seaborg joined other scientists in unsuccessfully urging President Truman to demonstrate the awful power of atomic energy in a remote, uninhabited location in order to encourage Japan to surrender without unprecedented destruction and massive loss of life.
He later served for 10 years as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and promoted arms control and the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
Akihito's career has been even more transformative. A hallmark of his reign, the New York Times recently reported, "was a long campaign to repent for the nation's wartime sins." His state visits to wartime sites such as Okinawa, Saipan, the Philippines and Singapore were only samples of his many public gestures that helped restore one of the world's most reviled warlike nations to an honored place as a nation at peace in the global community.
Let us wish Akihito well in his retirement.

Wildly popular mobile game lets players kill a reporter

Texto completo: The mission is called "Breaking News." It's the seventh mission in the game, and it comes after you've upgraded your sniper rifle to shoot at a distance of nearly 1,000 feet with accuracy.
By now, you've already taken out, among others, a gunman who allegedly killed several people at a pizzeria last year, someone who stole a backpack from a tourist, a sniper who (without a trace of irony) is killing innocent people, and three men guarding a gang's weapon arsenal.
"Breaking News" has a clear goal: kill a reporter.
"A journalist bribed a cop and will pick up a briefcase from the cop," the mission says. "The briefcase is full of sensitive documents. Make him famous in a different way." (In reality, journalists don't pay sources for information or material. There would certainly be no bribing.)
"Sniper 3D Assassin" is a mobile game on iOS and Android. It has a rating of about 4½ stars, with a combined 12 million reviews on both platforms. The app launched in 2014 and reached 10 million downloads in the first month, according to the developer, TFG Co., which is based in Brazil. In 2016, the developer claims it was the most-downloaded game in the App Store.
"Take your sniper, aim and start shooting your enemies," the game description reads.
New York Times editor Jamal Jordan shared an image of the game on Twitter and said his nephew invited him to play. "My nephew is 10, and we had a very long talk after," Jordan told HuffPost.
The Apple Store has guidelines that address violence in games, and it notes that "if you're looking to shock and offend people, the App Store isn't the right place for your app."
Specifically, the guidelines say "apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste." As examples, the guidelines cite "realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. 'Enemies' within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity."
Neither Apple nor Google responded to email inquiries. TFG Co., did not immediately respond to an email inquiry.
Attacks and threats against journalists have skyrocketed since 2017, when Donald Trump became president. Trump has continued to call journalists "the enemy of the people," despite criticism and fear that he is stoking tension and violence.
Last June 28, a man shot multiple journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Five people died and two were injured. Before the shooting, the alleged killer had sent letters to courthouses and a law firm stating: "I further certify I then did proceed to the office of respondent Capital-Gazette Communications ... with the objective of killing every person present," according to the Baltimore Sun.
In October, a pipe bomb was found in the CNN mailroom at the Time Warner Center in New York. The package was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan, who works as an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.
Charging documents included details suggesting that the suspect was critical of the media. The suspect's van was "covered with images including images critical of CNN," the complaint said.
Trump later told reporters that he didn't think he was responsible in any way for stoking the suspect's rage at the news media. "No, not at all," Trump said. He then attacked CNN on Twitter for suggesting that he was inciting violence against journalists.
The same month, Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi government agents. The Post later confirmed that the CIA determined Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had personally ordered the killing. Trump has denied the intelligence, despite having been shown evidence. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, "enjoys a close relationship" with the crown prince.

Trump denies plans to fly migrants from border to Florida

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday denied reports that hundreds of migrants would be flown from the Mexican border to Florida and other areas in the US interior to lessen the workload at crowded Border Patrol facilities.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, also on Sunday, acknowledged that federal officials did initially alert local leaders of the possibility that migrants would be flown to two South Florida counties. But Trump appeared to blame the media for "false reporting."
"There are no plans to send migrants to northern or Coastal Border facilities, including Florida," Trump wrote on Twitter. "...Our country is FULL, will not, and cannot, take you in!"
The office of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida also said Sunday that Trump told him he didn't approve and wouldn't authorize the transportation of the immigrants.
The governor' spokeswoman Helen Ferre said DeSantis spoke with Trump on Saturday, two days after local officials reacted with alarm to a US Border Patrol notification that 1,000 migrants could be sent on a weekly basis to Palm Beach and Broward counties, starting in about two weeks.
After the plan was attacked by local leaders last week, federal officials initially said the flights were only being considered and nothing was happening immediately.
On Sunday, McAleenan said that Florida and other cities in the interior were no longer in consideration. He appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation" and said the plan "wasn't going to be an effective use of government resources."
DeSantis apparently had been caught off guard and said such flights would amount to "dumping" migrants on Florida. He appeared upset that Florida was even a consideration, especially after he recently signed a bill banning sanctuary cities and pledging to help federal immigration authorities.
Trump and DeSantis are close. The president endorsed DeSantis, which propelled him from underdog to winner in last year's governor's race.

RNC accepts money from Steve Wynn
President Trump has generally bucked the #MeToo movement, siding instead with the men who deny accusations of sexual assault or misconduct.
Now, the Republican National Committee appears to be following his lead.
Steve Wynn, the billionaire former casino mogul who resigned as chairman of Wynn Resorts and as finance chairman of the RNC last year after The Wall Street Journal revealed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades, has recently donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the committee.
On Thursday, he was spotted by television cameras arriving at a high-dollar fund-raising dinner for Trump and the committee, dressed in a red blazer and matching red tie.
The event, a 40-person dinner with the president on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, was hosted by Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and raised more than $5 million, according to Trump aides. Dinner attendees, in conversations after the event, did not mention that Wynn, 77, had been there.
It was not clear whether Trump and Wynn, who has denied the allegations, spoke privately at Lutnick's penthouse.
Politico reported last week that Wynn gave $248,500 to the Republican National Committee and an additional $150,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in April. In the past, both he and his wife have donated, but this time it was just him.
Republican officials insisted that there was a difference between holding the position of finance chairman while fighting off serious allegations of sexual misconduct, and simply donating money.
Still, the RNC's decision to accept money from Wynn — and to not return funds he contributed in the past — opens the fund-raising committee up to questions of hypocrisy.
Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the RNC, has frequently called for the Democratic National Committee to return all money received from Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who was accused by dozens of women of harassment, assault, and rape and who was a prolific Democratic donor and a close friend of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic National Committee has given away some of Weinstein's contributions. McDaniel has drawn a distinction between Wynn and Weinstein because, she said, Wynn denied the charges against him. But Weinstein, who was charged in New York with rape, has pleaded not guilty.

Carter finds a renaissance in 2020 Democratic scramble
Jimmy Carter carved an unlikely path to the White House in 1976 and endured humbling defeat after one term. Now, six administrations later, the longest-living chief executive in American history is re-emerging from political obscurity at age 94 to win over his fellow Democrats once again.
A peanut farmer turned politician then worldwide humanitarian, Carter is taking on a special role as several Democratic candidates look to his family-run campaign after the Watergate scandal as the road map for toppling President Trump in 2020.
"Jimmy Carter is a decent, well-meaning person, someone who people are talking about again given the time that we are in," said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in an interview. "He won because he worked so hard, and he had a message of truth and honesty. I think about him all the time."
Klobuchar is one of at least three presidential hopefuls who've ventured to the tiny town of Plains, Ga., to meet with Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 91. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also have visited with the Carters and attended the former president's Sunday School lesson in Plains.
Carter had planned to teach at Maranatha Baptist Church again Sunday, but he is still recuperating at home days after hip replacement surgery following a fall as he was preparing for a turkey hunt.
"An extraordinary person," Buttigieg told reporters after meeting Carter. "A guiding light and inspiration," Booker said in a statement. Klobuchar has attended Carter's church lesson, as well, and says she e-mails with him occasionally. "He signs them 'JC,"' she said with a laugh.
It's quite a turnabout for a man who largely receded from party politics after his presidency, often without being missed by his party's leaders in Washington, where he was an outsider even as a White House resident.

How is 'Jeopardy!' champion paid?

Texto completo: Q: The current "Jeopardy!" champion, James Holzhauer, has racked up over $1.6 million and is going strong. I wondered how his compensation is paid. Is he given installments until he loses or must he wait until the end of his run?
A: Apparently he has to wait not only until the end of his run, but until his last show airs – which could be months after it was taped. That, according to various reports, keeps contestants from violating signed agreements not to reveal the outcome of their performance until after audiences have had a chance to see it.
And the check may take longer to arrive. Newsweek.com noted recently that one winner earlier this year was told her check would arrive 120 days after her last telecast.
Q: There used to be a special years ago, before Christmas, called "Amahl and the Night Visitors." Any idea what ever happened to it? I haven't seen it in years!
A: "Amahl," which aired for the first time on NBC on Christmas Eve 1951, was composed by Gian Carlo Menotti and is considered the first opera written especially for television. About a boy who encounters the Three Wise Men on their way to the infant Jesus, the hourlong show was sponsored by Hallmark, setting the stage for its "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentations in ensuing decades.
"Amahl" drew raves, won a Peabody Award and became a holiday season perennial (in live and taped renditions) for 15 years. There were also staged theater productions around the country.
But Menotti was unhappy with a '60s production that he had neither supervised nor approved in advance and refused to allow further TV presentations when he regained the rights to the opera. "I'd rather see no production at all of 'Amahl' than a bad one," he told the New York Times in 1966. Menotti and NBC did agree to a new telecast in 1978, with him as music director. It was not a success. Still, companies continue to stage "Amahl." And you can find various versions online; YouTube has 1951's and 1978's. There's also a DVD of a 1955 telecast.
Q: Are you aware how unacceptable and immoral "Two and a Half Men" is? Why not show Mary Tyler Moore reruns?
A: I am aware that "Two and a Half Men," which originally aired on CBS from 2003 to 2015, was an often-popular comedy for adults about men whose lives included a lot of sex and the wanting of same, with almost no use of a moral compass. It was nominated for 47 Emmys, winning nine, including two for star Jon Cryer. "Men" is not on the level of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," an all-time classic, but at its best it could make me laugh. Still can.

Texto completo: My mom and I have a great relationship ... now.
There was a period when I was between the ages of 13 and 18 where she was the devil incarnate. She was moody, passive-aggressive, overbearing and judgmental. Sure, I was a teenager, but at least I was even-keeled, reasonable and — if I’m being honest — angelic.
She, on the other hand, expected me to clean my room, get good grades and not open my Christmas presents early.
But what’s a floor without clothes on it? And as for the Christmas presents, seriously, she hid them in the attic upstairs, which was basically OUT IN THE OPEN. What did she expect?
I remember one time I opened a present early. It was a soft and comfy green shirt and shorts set. So I decided to wear them to school, knowing I could always wrap them again.
And I did. I wore the outfit to school. You might say, I got plenty of looks. It was that cool.
My best friend Sheree said, “Are you wearing—”
“An early Christmas present?” I interrupted. “Why yes, yes I am. Thank you for noticing.”
When I got home, I placed the outfit back in the box and carefully rewrapped it, as one does. No one saw a thing. I felt like a ninja.
On Christmas morning, I opened it and feigned surprise, trying not to draw attention to the cat hairs on it that I had obviously accumulated while wearing it.
But then came the real surprise.
My mom said, “I thought you could use a new pair of pajamas.”
Pajamas?
I looked closer at the “outfit.” There were stars and moons stitched into the fabric, the shorts were very short and very loose, the tag said “nightie night” and OMG they were so obviously pajamas.
And I’d worn them to school. And gotten lots of looks. And thought I’d been so very clever.
Seriously, my mom was impossible.
This was the last straw. Something had to be done.
So I called a special meeting with my dad. I sat across from him in his study and placed my hands on his desk, and in my most grown-up voice, I said, “I can’t live with that woman. I don’t know if she’s going through a phase, or if she’s unhappy, or if she’s just plain the devil. But I do know that this situation is untenable.” (I had prepared myself by looking up words in my thesaurus.)
My dad placed his hands together and pressed them on his chin. “I understand,” he said. “This must be very hard for you.”
“Thank you,” I said. I was sure he completely understood. After all, he’d lived with her longer than I had. Maybe that’s how he learned to be so quiet and diplomatic.
I left the study feeling completely justified in my disapproval of the household matriarch.
It went on like this for years, until around the time I turned 18. Then my mom, Joan Ashton, seemed to get herself together. It would be another decade or so before I would realize that the threat wasn’t her. It was me, and my teenage raging hormones.
Since then, we have become besties. Sure, she once drove to Boise when she was trying to drive to Jackson Hole, and yes, she would make me go “potty” three times before we went anywhere, and of course there was the time she didn’t speak to me for a week after I dropped the f-bomb. But she also taught me that we come from a long line of strong women, and she uses weird phrases like “fart on a hot skillet” and she laughs at inappropriate times like at funerals, and she is always, always, there for me.
So here’s a very public (and a week late, but trust me we celebrated like normal people) Happy Mother’s Day, mom. I would also like to issue a blanket apology for 1988 to 1993.

Biggest prize in Europe eludes Manchester City

Texto completo: Manchester City's 6-0 rout of Watford in the FA Cup final Saturday puts a bow on the best two-year run by a British soccer club, one that included two league crowns, four domestic cups and an unprecedented treble. It may also have been the best single season for the Premier League as a whole, with the title race going down to the last minutes of the last weekend and four teams advancing to the finals of Europe's two biggest competitions.
That last part has never happened before, and it's a bit of history that takes some of the luster off Manchester City's accomplishments.
Manchester City's back-to-back league titles made it the first team to repeat as champion since crosstown rival Manchester United in 2008-09. The FA Cup win makes it the first team to sweep all three domestic competitions -- the EPL, League Cup and FA Cup -- in the same season.

Along the way, Manchester City broke, then tied, the single-season record for wins with 32 and is the only team to top 97 points in an EPL season, something it has done each of the last two years.
Yet for all that domestic dominance, Manchester City finished the season without the one prize it most covets: a European title, something four of the teams it vanquished at home still can win.
Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, who won three Champions League titles as a player and coach at Barcelona, said as much last week.
"I need to see what I can do better because right now in the Champions League I've not been good enough at this club," he told the team's website. "Even if we win the English trophies, it's still not certain that we're the best."
They're not -- not if other teams win the bigger prizes. Now it appears Manchester City's record-setting season might be tarnished even further after the club was referred to UEFA's club financial control body adjudicatory chamber following an investigation into allegations of unfair financial practices.
Although no recommendations for punishment have been made public, the New York Times reported investigators will ask for a seasonlong ban from the Champions League. Manchester City has been under scrutiny for possible breaches of UEFA's financial fair play regulations, which were designed to even the playing field by preventing clubs from spending their way into unmanageable debt.
The club, which has been accused of breaking the rules before, denied any wrongdoing. But the German magazine Der Spiegel, citing club documents gathered by the independent Football Leaks investigative project, say the club inflated sponsor fees when it spent more than expected. The New York Times estimated Manchester City's roster cost more than $1 billion to put together.
Apparently, even that wasn't enough to buy the club's owners everything they wanted. Manchester City's season is over now, but Chelsea and Arsenal, third and fifth, respectively, in the EPL standings, will meet in this month's Europa League championship in Azerbaijan. Second-place Liverpool and fourth-place Tottenham will face off in the Champions League final June 1 in Madrid.
Manchester City lost only two of 16 league games to those four teams in the last two seasons, outscoring them by a combined 38-11. Yet it was Liverpool and Tottenham that eliminated the team from Champions League play in the quarterfinals each of the last two years.
How, then, to explain the disconnect? How can a team be so dominant in league play yet so disappointing against the same teams in European play?
"In terms of points, goals and stats, we are the best," Guardiola said. "But football is not about numbers. It's about emotions."
Macnhester City is not the only team to dominate domestic competitions only to stumble repeatedly in European tournaments. Paris Saint-Germain has won seven of the last eight French titles and 15 domestic cups since 2012-13 but hasn't gotten past the quarterfinals of an international competition in more than two decades.
Juventus has won eight Serie A titles and eight Italian cups in the last eight seasons but hasn't won a European title this century. Bayern Munich, which Saturday captured its seventh straight Bundesliga title, has won just one Champions League title in that span.
Fatigue could be one explanation. In City's case, Saturday's FA Cup final was the 61st game of the season. Liverpool, which finished a point back in the EPL race, played 11 fewer domestic matches after losing in the first round of both the FA and league cups.
Then there's the fact a round ball can take funny bounces in a competition like the Champions League. Barcelona, winner of the last two Spanish crowns, was twice knocked out of the European tournament short of the final, blowing three-goal leads in the second leg both times. Tottenham won its spot in this year's final by overcoming a three-goal deficit of its own, on the road, on Lucas Moura's score six minutes into stoppage time.
Finally, there's desire. Manchester City's two league titles in the last two seasons are two more than Liverpool has won in the Premier League era. Tottenham has won just two in its history, the last in 1961. As a result, the chance to win something -- anything -- is likely to burn hotter in those two dressing rooms.
For Liverpool, playing in the Champions League final is a fitting end to a season in which it was the only European team to lose just once in league play. And the Reds' 97 points were the third-highest total in EPL history behind only City.
Liverpool made it this far a year ago only to see scoring leader Mohamed Salah hobble off with an injury in the 31st minute of a 3-1 loss to Real Madrid in Kiev.
"That was tough," defender Virgil van Dijk told the soccer magazine FourFourTwo. But the loss, he said, left he and his teammates with a clear goal for this season.
"Take it, learn from it, and try to not let it happen again."
If Liverpool does that and wins, its season may not be the best ever, but it will arguably be better than Manchester City's year.

On abortion, Democrats must take offensive

Texto completo: For
In response to the new wave of shocking state laws passed by Republicans to strangle abortion rights, Sen. Elizabeth Warren put out a list of things Democrats can do to push back. Her approach is centered on federal legislation to supersede draconian state laws and guarantee women their rights.
This is highly unusual, because what we hear from Democrats on this issue is almost entirely defensive. Instead of proposing new legislation to aggressively expand abortion rights, the most they can muster is explanations of why the latest Republican law goes too far, all presented as though they’d prefer to be talking about something else.
It’s understandable that Democrats would feel despondent about what’s happening now. What isn’t understandable is that they act like they’re the ones who have something to apologize for.
I have argued that Republicans are moving so quickly and aggressively to destroy Roe v. Wade because they have a very simple view of power: When you have it, use it to get what you want. It doesn’t matter to them that their policy goal, the elimination of Roe, is supported by only around 30 percent of the public. They know they could suffer a political backlash if they succeed, but it’s a chance they’re willing to take.
And the chances of that backlash are mitigated by their successful effort to create a system of minority rule. Because of the way the Senate gives disproportionate power to small conservative states, they hold the chamber despite the fact that many more Americans voted to be represented there by Democrats.
That puts Mitch McConnell in charge, and his limitless cynicism allowed him to refuse to allow President Barack Obama to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2016.
Then President Donald Trump, who was in office despite the fact that his opponent got more votes, filled that seat with a justice guaranteed to overturn Roe, and another to join him.
Meanwhile, Republican gerrymanders and vote suppression put in place the extremist state legislatures and governors eager to create a reproductive rights dystopia, where, as many people have pointed out, when a 12-year-old girl is raped, the doctor who performs an abortion for her would be sent to prison for longer than her rapist.
All that is true, as is the fact that Roe is all but gone already (more on that in a moment) and the possibilities for what could ensue run from the dreadful to the horrific. But apart from saying, “This is terrible,” what are Democrats actually proposing to do about it?
The answer for most of them is not much, apart from saying that it’s really bad. Just as they have for years, Democrats are acting as though they’re the ones whose beliefs about this issue are in the minority, when the opposite is true. All that’s necessary to make them cover their heads in fear that the public will turn on them is for Republicans to start spreading some rancid blood libel about women giving birth and then murdering their babies.
And of course, savvy reporters can be counted on to write stories about how shrewd Republicans are being in spreading those lies, with lines like this, from The New York Times: “The debate is still very much an open one. But it may come down to what Americans find more persuasive: the kind of nuanced explanation and argument abortion rights supporters are making, or a searing, one-word label like ‘infanticide.’ ”
Perhaps Democrats could get the same compliments from the press if they started claiming that the GOP has proposed that all American girls must be taken to internment camps upon their first period so they can be impregnated by Republican state legislators. That might be a gross exaggeration of the truth, but “Say no to Republican child rape internment camps!” would sure make a “searing” message.
Of course, Democrats don’t have to go that far. You may recall how a few years ago Republicans thought they had the chance to destroy Planned Parenthood after some right-wing scammers used secretly recorded (and misleadingly edited) videos to claim the organization was selling fetal tissue illegally. Why, advocates of choice were really on the defensive!
In reality, they found that the organization remained hugely popular (in a poll, 75 percent of Americans rejected the GOP position that Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for health services should be banned), and their efforts failed.
So here’s the current situation. Like it or not, Roe v. Wade is done. Either the five conservative justices on the Supreme Court will overturn it outright, or they will find a way to eviscerate it while leaving it nominally in place. Democrats can mount a public persuasion campaign to make sure everyone understands what the consequences are going to be, but in the short run they can’t change Roe’s fate.
So they have to take the offensive.
That means, as Warren suggests, writing a slate of federal laws that will protect and expand reproductive rights, not just in states where Democrats are in control but for all American women, especially those unfortunate enough to live in states controlled by Republicans.
That means guaranteeing the right to abortion, preventing the TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws that attempt to regulate abortion clinics out of existence, increasing penalties for those who attempt to harass and intimidate medical personnel, and making medication abortions widely and freely available.
Most of all, Democrats need to stop worrying that there’s a guy in a MAGA hat sitting in a diner in Ohio who won’t like the sound of their reproductive rights agenda. Forget him. He’s in the minority. Democrats have the majority of the American people behind them. They need to start acting like it.

Texto completo: As people continue to complain about the current season of "Game of Thrones," consider redirecting your attention to another series: the 22nd season of "Arthur."
In the season premiere, which aired Monday, Arthur and the rest of his ageless classmates learn that their third-grade teacher, Nigel Ratburn, is getting married. Good for him!
The episode quickly gained traction online among grown "Arthur" fans, eliciting two major reactions: First, who among the non-parents knew PBS was still airing new episodes? But more importantly, fans joined the Lakewood Elementary kids in being pleasantly surprised by whom Mr. Ratburn had chosen to marry: an aardvark named Patrick.
The kids had worried that Mr. Ratburn, whom they had overheard talking about floral arrangements, was engaged to a bossy stranger named Patty. They spend several minutes of the show channeling their disappointment into playing matchmaker, only to discover at the wedding ceremony that Patty (voiced by Jane Lynch) isn't actually their teacher's fiance, but a sibling. Muffy squeaks the question on all of our minds: "If Patty's his sister, then who is Mr. Ratburn marrying?"
In comes the man of the hour, walking arm in arm with Patrick, a local chocolatier. Cut to the dance floor, where Buster approaches his friends with a plate of "the best cake I've ever had," a nod to Mr. Ratburn's famous love of the dessert.
After Arthur exclaims, "Mr. Ratburn is married! I still can't believe it," Francine responds that it's "a brand-new world." There is no explicit reference made to Patrick's gender, furthering the message of acceptance. GLAAD was among many who congratulated the beloved teacher on Twitter. Several users referred to him as a gay icon.
Mr. Ratburn and "the Special Someone," as Patrick is referred to in the episode's title, join a small group of LGBTQ figures to appear in the "Arthur" universe. In 2005, PBS pulled an episode of the spinoff "Postcards From Buster," which followed Arthur's rabbit friend as he visited cities across North America. Margaret Spellings, a secretary of education under former President George W. Bush, had denounced the episode featuring the children of two lesbians living in Vermont because, according to a New York Times article from the time, she believed many parents wouldn't want to "expose" their children to a same-sex couple.
"I am disappointed by PBS's decision," Marc Brown, author of the "Arthur" books and creator of both television series, said to the Times in a statement. He added that "Postcards From Buster" existed to "connect kids with other kids by reflecting their lives. In some episodes, as in the Vermont one, we are validating children who are seldom validated."
The only sense of discomfort in "Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone" comes from Francine, and it has nothing to do with her teacher's choice of partner. She looks to the other end of the dance floor and says with wide eyes, "But there's one thing that teachers should never, ever do."
"What?" Buster asks.
"Dance," Francine responds, pointing to Mr. Ratburn and Patrick as they wow the crowd with their moves.

The Big Story You Don't Read About

Texto completo: My colleague David Bornstein points out that a lot of American journalism is based on a mistaken theory of change. That theory is: The world will get better when we show where things have gone wrong. A lot of what we do in our business is expose error, cover problems and identify conflict.
The problem with this is that we leave people feeling disempowered and depressed. People who consume a lot of media of this sort sink into this toxic vortex -- alienated from people they don't know, fearful about the future. They are less mobilized to take action, not more.
Bornstein, who writes for The Times and also co-founded the Solutions Journalism Network, says that you've got to expose problems, but you've also got to describe how the problems are being tackled. The search for solutions is more exciting than the problems themselves.
But many of our colleagues don't define local social repair and community-building as news. It seems too goody-goody, too "worthy," too sincere. It won't attract eyeballs.
That's wrong.
I've spent the past year around people who weave social fabric, and this week about 275 community weavers gathered in Washington, for a conference called #WeaveThePeople, organized by the Weave project I've been working on at the Aspen Institute.
The people at this gathering are some of the most compelling people I've ever met. Charles Perry was incarcerated for nearly two decades and now connects community members to health care systems in Chicago. Dylan Tête was an Army ranger who served in Iraq, suffered from PTSD and has built communities in New Orleans for vets. Sarah Adkins came home one Sunday to find her husband had killed their kids and himself, and she now runs a free pharmacy and leads a life of service in Appalachian Ohio.
Pancho Argüelles works in Texas, accompanying workers who have suffered spinal cord injuries on the job. He helps find the diapers, wheelchairs and other things that will allow them to live with dignity. Pancho radiates a deep wisdom, almost a holiness. As he and the others spoke about their values, the same thought kept pounding in my head: How is this not a story? Why don't we cover these people more?
At most conferences people lead with their bios, but at this gathering people led with their pain.
A prominent researcher described how she was abused as a child, and how this led her into her research into children's emotional development. A woman from South Carolina talked about loved ones she had lost and the time she tried to talk a man out of jumping off a bridge, finally confessing: If you jump, I'm going to jump, too. A man admitted that all the people he had loved had left him, and that he had lived with the trauma believing that his wife will leave him, too. In the atmosphere created this week he felt free to let go of that trauma.
It was emotionally gripping through and through. The weavers know how to open relationships with vulnerability and they know how to build connections and move to action. Their defining feature is that they are geniuses at relationship.
This was a gathering in which it was permissible to be an angry black person. Some of the African-American participants fully ventilated their anger at injustice. It was uncomfortable and searing, but the discomfort broke through barriers and moved us closer.
Martha Welch, a professor and researcher at Columbia, pointed out that our emotional health is dependent on connection with others. We don't just regulate emotions ourselves. We co-regulate with others and need connection with others to keep from spinning out of control.
The weavers are acutely sensitive to states of mind that can build or mar relationship: how people can feel more or less efficacy, depending on the emotional conditions in a room; how words like "social justice" and "biblical" can be good or bad depending on whom you are speaking with, and how much damage is done when people demand you use words their way, instead of asking: Well, what do you mean by that word?
There were so many acute observations about building community: "Relationship moves at the speed of trust. Social change moves at the speed of relationship." "Neighbors are people we practice doing life with." "I don't fix people's problems; I let them unfold. I respect the mystery of healing." "We're trying to do something that has never been done before. We're trying to create the earth's first mass, multicultural democratic republic."
Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that associational life is the central feature of American life. But somehow we in the media under-cover this sector. We barely cover the most important social change agents. These people are not goody-goody. They are raw, honest and sometimes rude.
How did we in our business get in the spot where we spend 90 percent of our coverage on the 10 percent of our lives influenced by politics and 10 percent of our coverage on the 90 percent of our lives influenced by relationship, community and the places we live in every day?

Texto completo: Two things necessitate a change in the usual pattern here of alternating between Black men and women. First, as I write this it's Mother's Day and second, the historic African-American haven Weeksville in Brooklyn is once again on the brink of being closed.
In 1827, after African slavery had been abolished in New York, James Weeks, a Black longshoreman, bought land from abolitionist Henry Thompson. Thompson had acquired the land after buying it from the wealthy Lefferts family and that set the stage for the heritage site. Soon, the site or hamlet attracted hundreds of Black Americans, free and many formerly in bondage. It was a community that provided a school, church, a newspaper and practically every vestige of a thriving neighborhood.
But more than a century later Weeksville was nearly forgotten until Brooklyn activists stepped in and began a movement to save and reaffirm the refuge, none more tireless than Joan Maynard.
According to recent stories, the Weeksville Heritage Center is threatened with closure given a shortfall of funds to sustain its operation. Well, where is the storied preservationist Maynard now that the center is facing a shutdown?
Unfortunately, Maynard died in 2006 at 77, ending her impressive record of community activism and self-determination.
Born Joan Cooper on Aug. 29, 1928, in Brooklyn, her father, John Cooper, was a ventriloquist and her mother, the former Julia St. Bernard, told stories about racist oppression. In her household, Joan was a witness to her parents' talents and community endeavors. She was a graduate of Empire State College and worked as a commercial and graphic artist for the McGraw-Hill publishing company. Her illustrations and drawings were often featured on the cover of such publications as the NAACP's CRISIS magazine and in her own depictions in comic books of African-American history.
The turbulence of the late 1960s in the nation provided a number of unintended consequences, many of them quite rewarding, including a renewed attention to Weeksville which had virtually been forgotten. With the "discovery" of a few small cottages on the edge of Crown Heights, activists pounced on the situation and determined that the cottages were the remaining vestiges of the historic site.
Joan led an initiative to not only protect the cottages but to renovate them and preserve them as part of the city's African-American heritage. In this campaign, she often enlisted the help and support of schoolchildren and volunteers. In 1970, the cottages were designated city landmarks and later added to the National Register of Historic Places. She was the founding member of the Weeksville Society and later became president and executive director of the Society, overseeing the refurbishing of the houses.
By 2004, the renovation of the houses, at a cost of $3 million, was completed and they were subsequently opened to the public. Throughout the process, Joan was a dauntless steward, making sure things were done to specifications she and her members insisted on, so that they be done with dignity and the best enterprise. Even so, it wasn't without its setbacks and adversity, including vandalism and severe damage caused by a car crashing into one of the buildings. Following these damaging incidents the homes had to be rebuilt, which again brought new challenges to Joan and her members. "She's one of the strongest women I know. She was very focused on her goals and was the kind of person unafraid to move forward to make sure she met her challenges," said Pamela Green, who succeeded Joan at the helm of the Society. Green said her vision and commitment to Weeksville was unwavering and she retained a desire to make sure there was a connection between the past and present, particularly for the younger people in the community. "By aiming our programs at young people, we can be part of the process of creating a generation that grows up without the misunderstandings that previous generations experienced," Green added.
Never one to cower in the face of power or opposition, Joan stood as an unflinching sentinel, even challenging those who suggested the cottages be moved from its location to other parts of Brooklyn. "It needs to be here, where many of the people have no knowledge of their own history," Joan told The New York Times. She was just as adamant about this as she was about the welfare of the community's young people. "The children have to learn they're not trash," she said during an interview.
Former Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz had nothing but admiration for Joan stating that she was "one of the most extraordinary individuals ever to call Brooklyn home. No one can say how many generations of Brooklyn children will grow up with a stronger, prouder sense of their own identity because Joan spent more than three decades working to ensure that the story of Weeksville... would be unearthed and retold."
While much is known about Joan's public persona and activism, less is known about her personal life which included two marriages that ended in divorce. Known too are the many awards she received, including the Louise DuPont Crowninshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, of which she had been a trustee. She retired in 1999, but continued to promote Weeksville.
For the image of Weeksville, Joan chose a tintype of a dignified woman, elegantly outfitted with a tidy hat, tight bodice and spectacles. To her this was the symbol of Weeksville and to some extent a self-envisioned one.
The Center's current director, Rob Fields, who arrived there two years ago, said plans are underway to expand the donor base with aim toward acquiring more corporate funding and increasing the Center's rental space. The place is mainly a visitor site for the city's young students where they learn of Joan's dedication and concern for the preservation of history.
"It's an incredible history of Black selfdetermination, creativity and self-improvement," Fields told the press.
It was during this same period of time that State Senator Velmanette Montgomery helped to commemorate a street со-naming in honor of Joan, calling it the "Dr. Joan Maynard Way," which can be perceived in a number of ways.

Calif. man admits making threats

Texto completo: A California man pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges that he threatened to kill employees of The Boston Globe in retaliation for the news organization's national editorial campaign against President Trump's attacks on the press.
In approximately 14 calls to the Globe's newsroom in August, Robert D. Chain, 68, repeatedly vowed to attack journalists on behalf of Trump, who has denounced news organizations as the “enemy of the people."
The Globe's editorial board had called on publications across the country to speak out against Trump's “sustained assault on the free press."
On Wednesday, Chain kept his gaze down as Assistant US Attorney George P. Varghese read a list of Chain's violent threats.
“You are the enemy of the people and we are going to shoot you all." “You are the enemy of the people. We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs." “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
When Varghese finished, US District Judge William G. Young turned to Chain and asked “Are those things true?"
“Yes they are, your honor," Chain said.
Chain began calling the Globe on Aug. 10 and continued until the FBI's SWAT team arrested him Aug. 30 at his Encino, Calif., home, where they discovered 20 firearms, including a semiautomatic rifle he purchased in May 2018, records show. He is not facing charges related to the firearms.
Chain was indicted on seven counts of use of interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person based on the calls to the Globe's main newsroom telephone line. Court records include partial transcripts of his comments, which often included expletives and lewd language directed at Globe employees.
In some calls, he made reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.
“We're going to kill every [expletive] one of you. Go [expletive] yourself. Call the FBI. Go get some help from [expletive] Mueller okay you [expletive]," he allegedly said Aug. 15. “You're a dead man."
On Aug. 16, the day the Globe published the coordinated editorial response, Chain vowed to murder a Globe journalist at 4 p.m. that day, according to federal court records. In response, law enforcement officers were stationed outside the Globe's offices.
“As long as you keep attacking the president, the duly elected president of the United States, in the continuation of your treasonous and seditious acts, I will continue to threat, harass, and annoy the Boston Globe," Chain said in an Aug. 22 call, records show.
In a statement, Jane Bowman, a Globe spokeswoman, said, “We're pleased with the plea of guilt, remain appreciative of the law enforcement agencies that pursued justice, and will continue to closely watch the legal process play out in this case."
Chain has not been charged with placing calls to any other organizations, but prosecutors said in court papers that Chain allegedly made similar telephone calls to New York Times columnist Bret Stephens.
Chain is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 23. He faces between 10 and 21 months in prison. Chain and his attorney declined to speak to a reporter as they left the courtroom.
At the hearing, Young spent about 45 minutes going over the plea with Chain and explaining the legal process. He asked Chain repeatedly whether he was certain he wanted to plead guilty.
“I think it's the best way to settle this issue, your honor," Chain said.
Young pressed him again.
“What's going on when you sayyou think this is the best way to settle it? What do you mean by that?" Young said.
Chain spoke briefly with his lawyer, William D. Weinreb.
“Pleading guilty because I am guilty, your honor," Chain said.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”
------------
WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

Texto completo: Lock him up?
Attorney General William Barr reportedly joked Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , about being put in handcuffs on the sidelines of an event honoring slain law enforcement officers outside the Capitol.
“Madam Speaker, did you bring your handcuffs?" Barr quipped to Pelosi, according to the New York Times and the Washington Post.
Pelosi smiled and offered her own tongue-in-cheek response. The House sergeant-at-arms was in attendance, should an arrest be necessary, the top Democrat told the attorney general. Barr reportedly chuckled and walked away, according to the outlets.
More: Is there a Capitol jail where Democrats could lock up Trump aides who refuse to testify?
The exchange comes as tensions between House Democrats and the Trump administration continue to rise over multiple requests for documents, testimony from Barr and other current and past administration officials, and subpoenas issued by multiple congressional committees.
Wednesday, the White House, in a 12-page letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , declined to hand over information requested by the panel as part of a wide-ranging investigation into President Donald Trump's presidency.
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in the letter wrote that the administration would not cooperate with the committee's request, saying it "has no legitimate role" to investigate the president. In addition, the top White House lawyer said the request was overreach by politically motivated lawmakers.

Recently, the Trump administration has repeatedly stonewalled multiple requests from lawmakers for various types of information.
The House Judiciary Committee last week voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress after Barr refused to comply with a subpoena that called for an unredacted copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report and its underlying evidence.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. , however, told reporters Wednesday that a vote in the House to hold Barr in contempt will not happen this month.
More: Democrats could hold AG Barr in contempt of Congress. What is that and can it actually be used?
Last week, Speaker Pelosi joked that she would put administration officials that do not comply with subpoenas in a "jail down in the basement of the Capitol. " According to the Architect of the Capitol, several rooms have been used at various times as detention cells. A room in the basement of the Capitol was used in 1877, according to the Congressional Record. The Capitol Police currently have a holding cell three blocks from the Capitol.
“Let me just say that we do have a jail down in the basement of the Capitol,” Pelosi said recently during an interview at a Washington Post Live event. “But if we were arresting all of the people in the administration, we would have an overcrowded jail situation, and I’m not for that. ”

Russian President Vladimir Putin calls special counsel Mueller's inquiry 'very objective'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Russian President Vladimir Putin called Robert Mueller's investigation "very objective" Tuesday and said he hoped the special counsel's final report would allow the United States and Russia to reboot their diplomatic relationship, which has been strained by the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election and questions about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
"However exotic the work of special counsel Mueller was, I have to say that on the whole, he has had a very objective investigation, and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between Russia and the incumbent administration, which we said was absolutely fake," Putin said before a closed-door meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Sochi on Tuesday.
Putin said he believes President Donald Trump "intends to rebuild U. S. -Russian relations," and he hopes "right now the conducive environment is being built for that. "
Pompeo pressed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in an earlier private meeting Tuesday, to prove that Russian meddling in U. S. elections had stopped.
"We hope this tumultuous situation will die down and we can finally move on to building more professional, constructive dialogue between Russia and the U. S. ," the Russian diplomat said.
Pompeo said he pressed Lavrov on Russia's interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election and "conveyed that there are things Russia can do to demonstrate that these types of activities are a thing of the past. "
Pompeo did not elaborate on what steps Russia could take, but he said if the Kremlin interferes in the 2020 election, "it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it’s been. "
The two men said they had a "frank" discussion about a range of other geopolitical flashpoints:
Iran
Kremlin officials have expressed frustration with the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive rhetoric about the threat Iran poses – and a possible U. S. military response. The Trump administration has made isolating Iran economically and politically the cornerstone of its foreign policy.
Pompeo warned that Iran or its proxies in the region planned attacks on U. S. interests in the region, and the Pentagon dispatched an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter the alleged threats.
Pompeo declined to comment on a New York Times story published Tuesday, which said acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 U. S. troops to the Middle East in the event of an Iranian strike on U. S. forces or a move by Iran to speed up its development of nuclear weapons.
"We fundamentally do not see a war with Iran," Pompeo said. He said the United States wants Iran to stop funding terrorist groups and to "behave like a normal country. "
Lavrov said he hoped the report was "just a rumor" and expressed fears that tensions could spark a military confrontation.
"This region is so tense with different conflicts and different situations," Lavrov said. He said he told Pompeo he hopes they can find a "political solution" to the Iran situation, so it does not "tip over to the military scenario. "
Iran says Trump playing 'very dangerous game,' risking 'devastating war'
Venezuela
In the power struggle between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, Russia supports Maduro, a socialist leader who helped steer the country into a severe economic crisis.
The Trump administration backs Guaido, who has made several unsuccessful attempts to oust Maduro from power. The United States has imposed a series of severe sanctions on Venezuela.
After Guaido called for an uprising this month, Pompeo said Maduro was about to flee the country but was convinced to stay by the Kremlin. Maduro and Russian officials denied that account.
Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States wants "every country that’s interfering in Venezuela to cease doing that. "
Lavrov shot back by suggesting U. S. meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs. "Democracy cannot be done by force," he said.
'We need to know why': Lawmakers wary as Trump aides weigh military options for Venezuela
Nuclear weapons treaty
Perhaps the most consequential item on the agenda is a landmark U. S. -Russian arms control treaty called New START. Some advocates and lawmakers fear the Trump administration will abandon the treaty and spark a new nuclear arms race.
Trump administration officials said they’re pushing to broaden the U. S. pact to include China, aiming to craft a deal that limits China’s strategic warheads and other weapons.
They argue that China's growing arsenal has changed the dynamics of arms control, and this new era requires a broader approach than the New START treaty offers.
"The president has charged his national security team to think more broadly about arms control to include countries beyond our traditional U. S. -Russia framework and a broader range of weapons systems," Pompeo said Tuesday.
Chinese officials said they have no interest in such a deal.
“China does not see any necessity and does not intend to join bilateral talks between Russia and the U. S on nuclear disarmament,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Monday during his own meeting with Russian officials in Sochi. “We keep our nuclear arsenal at a minimum level, the bare necessary level to maintain our defense. ”
Critics questioned the Trump administration’s quest for a trilateral agreement, saying it’s a risky gambit that could jeopardize the New START treaty, which limits the United States and Russia to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, among other restrictions. That agreement lapses in February 2021, and experts said negotiations need to begin immediately if the Trump administration wants to renew New START.
If New START is allowed to lapse, “there will be no legally binding limits on the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals for the first time in nearly five decades,” Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan nonproliferation group, wrote in an analysis of the nascent negotiations.
Kimball noted that the U. S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, when combined, comprise more than 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. He expressed fears that the Trump administration’s position is a ruse to kill the New START treaty, not broaden it, by making unrealistic demands.
Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is an ardent opponent of arms control agreements, Kimball wrote, suggesting “this new grand-deal gambit does not represent a serious attempt to halt and reverse a global arms race. "
“It is more likely that Trump and Bolton are scheming to walk away from New START by setting conditions they know to be too difficult to achieve,” he said.

Texto completo: ARLINGTON, Ohio - If Ping is searching for a new company pitchman, look no further than Dale Cohen, an unassuming 62-year-old from Findlay who just so happened to record two holes-in-one in a single round with two remarkable swings of a G15 8-iron.

The odds of getting two holes-in-one in the same round are 67 million to 1, worse than getting attacked by a shark (11.5 million to 1), having identical quadruplets (15 million to 1), or being elected president of the United States (32.6 million to 1).

The can-you-believe-it moments occurred April 29 on a cool, rainy Monday at Sycamore Springs Golf Course in Arlington.

I've had some bad shots in my day, but these were beautiful, said Cohen, a 17 handicap who shot 89.

I couldn't have hit them any better, obviously. I'm just your normal everyday player. But I guess two holes-in-one is a big deal.

Cohen, who works third shift at Continental Structural Plastics in Carey, Ohio, arrived at the first tee with little sleep. Fatigue and a weather system suitable for Scotland - 42 degrees, 25 mph winds, and intermittent showers - were not going to keep Cohen away from the links, although half of his league opted not to play.

[The] conditions were terrible, he said.

When he got to the 138-yard par-3 second hole, he pulled an 8-iron from his bag and teed up a yellow Titleist golf ball, which landed five feet left of the pin and spun right into the hole.

It was a really nice shot, Cohen said. But there are a lot of people that have holes-in-one, so I didn't get overly excited. I didn't want to brag or get out of my zone. I yelled, and then it was all fine.

Six holes later, Cohen pulled out the same 8-iron and yellow Titleist. His playing partners, Denny Dantuano, Denny Underwood, and Dave Deeter, urged him to use a different ball. The 138-yard par-3 eighth requires a shot over water, so Cohen put the Titleist away and pulled out a yellow Callaway.

The ball never left the pin, landing a foot away before trickling into the hole.

Two holes-in-one in the same round and a place in golf history.

When we got to No. 8, let me tell you, Cohen said, anyone who's had a hole-in-one, when they get to the next par 3, they're thinking, 'Wow, what would it be like if I got another one?'

The first thing I thought was, 'Who's going to believe this?' I didn't believe it. I ran up and looked in the hole and started screaming. The guys ahead of us thought we were pulling a prank.

Dantuano, Underwood, and Deeter were as astonished. Dantuano has two holes-in-one and has witnessed others, but what he saw on that day still doesn't compute.

To be honest, the 71-year-old said, I witnessed two of the prettiest golf shots you'd ever want to see. They were both nice and high, landed near the hole, and rolled in. We couldn't believe it. I mean, you don't expect something like that. It's unbelievable. That's about the only way I can describe it.

And the excitement wasn't totally done. On the par-3 12th, Cohen's shot landed eight feet from the hole. He had another close call on the par-3 15th, with his ball landing 10 feet away. Cohen parred both holes.

He described the rare feat as winning the lottery but not getting paid. It's a similar experience for Sycamore Springs, which doesn't get a monster payout like a gas station when it sells winning Powerball or Mega Millions tickets. The course is getting a healthy dose of publicity, though, with stories in the New York Times, Washington Post, and on NPR mentioning the Scotty Wilson-designed track.

Cohen estimates he was awake for 34 consecutive hours in three days before, during, and after his holes-in-one. He has no problem sleeping soundly now, even if he doesn't curl up with his 8-iron like it's a stuffed animal.

Said Cohen: It's great.

Texto completo: BY RYAN J. FOLEY
The Associated Press
Cory Booker was the mayor of New Jersey's largest city and considering a run for higher office, but he had a different goal in mind when he appeared on stage at the 2012 Tech Disrupt Conference in San Francisco.
Booker was there to promote Waywire, the social media company that he had recently co-founded. He believed the video-sharing network could change the way millennials consumed news and participated in politics - a prospect that positioned Booker as a tech-savvy political leader of the next generation and stood to earn him millions.
Waywire aimed to improve on YouTube by making it easier to create, share and discover videos based on one's interests. Booker told the audience that the videos would elevate the voices of everyday Americans and their challenges, helping address everything from discrimination to joblessness. "We can change America at a far more rapid pace than it's being changed right now," he said.
Booker's grand ambitions for Waywire crashed. The company fizzled out in the way that many digital startups have over the years. Booker kept his focus on politics, winning two elections to the Senate and earlier this year launching a bid to be president.
But his one-time aspiration to be a revolutionary tech mogul is a revealing window into his close association to the industry, his optimism about the power of technology and his willingness to mix public service with a for-profit business. At the time his involvement raised questions about whether he was potentially beholden to influential Silicon Valley leaders, who invested in the startup.
At campaign stops, Booker does not bring up Waywire. But the company could resurface as a political liability at a time when many Americans - including Booker and his Democratic rivals - are calling for tougher regulations on tech companies.
Booker declined an interview request, but campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh defended his decision to start Waywire while leading Newark, a city of 285,000 people.
"Cory is passionate about bringing people together, and when presented with the opportunity to be a part of a new, forward-thinking and socially-conscious online video network, he jumped at the chance," she said.
Booker has taken a harder line toward the technology industry since Donald Trump's election. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that tech platforms "are becoming engines for discrimination, harassment, misinformation and extremism while stifling innovation."
In an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week," Booker declined to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up Facebook. But he said the Justice Department should study consolidation in the tech industry and others and more aggressively enforce antitrust laws.
At the 2012 tech conference, Booker called Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg "an American hero," praising his entrepreneurship and philanthropy. Booker had persuaded Zuckerberg to donate $100 million to help improve Newark's public schools.
Money from tech executives and employees has also helped fuel his political career. Former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who were among the early investors in Waywire, earlier this year gave $2,800 apiece to his presidential campaign, the maximum allowed.
Booker raised more than $447,000 from the internet industry for his Senate campaigns and his political action committee from 2013 through 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Supporters say his knowledge of the industry gives him valuable insight, noting that he pioneered the use of Twitter to communicate with constituents. They say he believes in the power of technology to be a force for social good, calling Waywire an earnest effort to improve political dialogue among young people.
"I think this indicates that he's a curious, and open and responsible person who doesn't use his authority or his influence for himself but to find more policies to help people," said Philip Stephenson, who was one of Waywire's first employees in 2012.
Stephenson said the day-to-day operations of the company, which was run out of a Manhattan office by Booker's founding partners Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson, was plagued by uncertainty about its direction. He and other journalists were let go after a few months as the company struggled. Booker severed ties with it after a media firestorm surrounding his role, which became a bump on his path to the U.S. Senate.
Waywire aimed to capitalize on Booker's popularity on Twitter, where he had amassed more than 1 million followers and communicated about storms and potholes with residents. Booker used his connections to help raise $1.75 million to start Waywire, which included investments from Schmidt's Innovation Partners, Hoffman and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga's manager.
The company was entwined with Booker's political brand from the start. The company posted videos that put Booker in a flattering light: delivering a commencement speech at his alma mater, Stanford; campaigning for President Barack Obama's re-election in 2012; and answering questions such as, "How do you feel about your superhero status?"
He urged his constituents and supporters to send him "wires," the homemade videos that he hoped would make the company compelling. A digital strategist who worked for him in Newark - and later in the U.S. Senate - joined the company.
Even as he was promoting Waywire publicly, Booker minimized his ties to it on the initial Senate financial disclosure form he filed as a candidate in 2013 running in a special election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg. He listed himself as a co-founder but didn't list his ownership as an asset.
Two months later, in July 2013, he amended his disclosure to list his Waywire stake as worth between $1 million and $5 million and to add his role as a board member. He said those details had been inadvertently omitted.
His rivals in the Democratic primary criticized Booker after his role in the company was the subject of a front-page New York Times article days before the election. They questioned whether he was seeking to profit at Newark's expense and was compromised by his tech associations. Tabloids pounced on a particularly juicy detail: that a Waywire advisory board included the teenage son of CNN President Jeff Zucker, who had been given a stock option for his role. The boy, 15, resigned.
Booker won the primary and shortly before the general election, announced that he had given his ownership stake to charity. A campaign spokesman said the donation wasn't itemized in his tax returns but that it went to the New Jersey Community Foundation. Foundation President Hans Dekker said he could not confirm the gift under its privacy policy but that Booker "has been wonderfully philanthropic not only to our foundation, but also to Newark in general."
Waywire was sold in 2013 for an unspecified sum to online video distributor Magnify Media, which took the brand in a different direction. Waywire's remaining assets were sold again, in 2017, to a company controlled by a Ukrainian entrepreneur and is no longer operating.
Steve Rosenbaum, of Magnify Media, said Booker's vision for Waywire was solid and remains relevant today. But he said Booker's role with the company was not sustainable once he started campaigning for Senate, which happened earlier than he expected following Lautenberg's death.
"All of a sudden, it was pretty clear that he just didn't have the bandwidth nor was it the right thing for him to be running for U.S. Senate and also running a startup," he said.

Rosenstein to graduates: 'You will be tested'; Former US Deputy Attorney General quotes Mueller at ; UB law commencement, first remarks since stepping down

Texto completo: Rod Rosenstein, in his first day of public appearances since ending a stormy tenure as U.S. deputy attorney general, defended his role in President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of former FBI director James Comey, whom he called a "partisan pundit."
Rosenstein's speech on Monday night at the Greater Baltimore Committee's annual meeting came after Comey - a sharp critic of Trump - recently criticized Rosenstein in a New York Times op-ed for giving a speech quoting the president on the importance of the rule of law. Trump, Comey wrote, "eats your soul in small bites."
Rosenstein struck back Monday night. "Now the former director seems to be acting as a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul," Rosenstein said at the Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel. "I kid you not. That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony."
Rosenstein also criticized Comey for his handling of an investigation into a private email server used by Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. Rosenstein said Comey "chose to send a letter to the Congress on the eve of the election stating that one of the presidential candidates was under criminal investigation, expecting that letter to be released immediately to the public. Those actions in my view were not within the realm of reasonable decisions."
Comey, who has delivered speeches around the country - including in Baltimore - about his tenure, has said he faced a difficult decision in effectively going public with the Clinton email investigation. But he has said he doesn't second-guess his decision.
In his speech, Rosenstein said he was determined to protect the independence of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russan interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Comey was fired in May 2017. In doing so, the White House pointed to a memo by Rosenstein in which he criticized the director's handling of the investigation of Clinton's email server.
Rosenstein said critics believed the ouster was part of an effort to derail the Russia investigation.
But Rosenstein told the business executives and dignitaries Monday night: "I was responsible for that investigation. I would never allow anyone to interfere with that investigation."
Earlier in the day, Rosenstein - the former U.S. attorney for Maryland - quoted Mueller in a speech urging University of Baltimore law school graduates to remain true to their principles.
"You will face pressure to compromise on things that matter most, perhaps even to trade virtue for the appearance of virtue," Rosenstein said in the commencement address at the packed Lyric theater. "But you should exercise caution when uncomfortable circumstances tempt you to disregard principles."
Rosenstein, wearing a dark graduation gown as he stood behind a lectern on the stage, then referenced a speech that Mueller - then FBI director - delivered at William & Mary in 2013.
"There may come a time when you will be tested," Rosenstein quoted Mueller as saying. "You may find yourself standing alone, against those you thought were trusted colleagues. You may stand to lose all that you have worked for. And it may not be an easy call."
Rosenstein was viewed by Democrats as a guardian of the Mueller probe. Meanwhile, Republicans sought to undermine the investigation and question the motives of Rosenstein and Mueller. Both are Republicans.
The report said investigators did not establish that Trump's 2016 campaign conspired with the Russians but reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice.
In introducing Rosenstein to the graduates, law school dean Ronald Welch called him a straight shooter who "was often under fire" and "made the tough calls."
Rosenstein's resignation - announced in an April 29 letter to Trump - was effective Saturday. In the letter, Rosenstein thanked the president for "the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity."
The letter came 11 days after the public release of Mueller's report.
Rosenstein was Maryland's U.S. attorney for 12 years when he left the office in Baltimore to serve as the No. 2 to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Pippen becomes 'Sitting Bull'

Texto completo: Scottie Pippen played 3,642 playoff minutes during his Hall of Fame career.
But it's the 1.8 seconds of postseason action he skipped 25 years ago Monday that are never far from the public conscious.
When Duke star and No. 1 NBA draft prospect Zion Williamson suffered a foot injury in January, the Bulls great advised he "shut it down" for the season to protect his future. That opened the door for fans and media to dredge up the time Pippen defiantly benched himself for the final seconds of an Eastern Conference semifinal game against the Knicks.
It took years, but Pippen and the Bulls mended fences, and now the team deploys him to events as one of as its favorite ambassadors, along with Toni Kukoc. That wrinkle is ironic given that it was Pippen's animus toward Kukoc (and Pippen's perception of fans' and the franchise's infatuation with the '94 rookie) that started the whole thing.
On May 13, 1994, the Bulls were fighting for their playoff lives in Game 3 against the Knicks, down 2-0 in the series. With 5.5 seconds left, Pippen waved for Kukoc to set a screen for him, which never materialized, and Pippen's contested heave that hit the top of the backboard ended up being a shot-clock violation. Ewing's hook shot tied the game at 102-102 with 1.8 seconds remaining.
Then coach Phil Jackson designed the final play for Kukoc -- with Pippen to inbound the ball.
According to the New York Times, citing ESPN reporter Andrea Kramer, Pippen swore and said, "I'm tired of this," then sat on the bench and refused to get up as teammates implored him to do so. Jackson had to call a second timeout.
Pete Myers inbounded in Pippen's place and Kukoc hit the game-winner.
According to multiple reports, Pippen got roasted in the locker room by teammates, old-schooler Bill Cartwright especially. Pippen apologized. In postgame comments, though, he and Jackson were equally entrenched in their positions.
"It wasn't pretty much Phil taking me out of the game," Pippen said. "It was like we exchanged words and I just took a seat."
Asked to elaborate on the exchange, he said, "I have no comment on that."
Meanwhile, Jackson explained Pippen's absence with a flip comment of his own.
"Scottie chose not to go on the court last night for his own specific reasons," Jackson said, according to the Los Angeles Times. "I put in a better passer in Pete Myers. Besides, Scottie had a fat lip and looked ugly at that point."
For years, Pippen's sit-down, coupled with him begging out of Game 7 of the 1990 Eastern Conference finals with a migraine, saddled him with the unfortunate nickname "Sitting Bull."
But over time, fans, teammates and management got over their ire about Pippen's occasional "me" moments and came to value the exceptional player that he was.
Cartwright told Tribune reporter Terry Armour in 1999, "Pip has proved himself time and time again since then.
"The real measurement of Scottie was last year against Utah, when he was in agony (from a sore back) and could barely move. Most players would have just stayed in the locker room, (but) he came out on the court and really put himself on the line to play that game.
"This guy was brave enough to get back on the court."
In 2010, when Pippen was to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, Jackson told the New York Times, "It was a learning moment in his life. He came back as a leader of teams for another decade."
That summer the Bulls brought him back as a team ambassador.
Months later, Pippen reflected on his career to the Sun-Times, including that pivotal moment.
"If given the chance again," he said, "I probably still would have sat out those last 1.8 seconds because I had earned the right to be on the court.
"So I have no regrets about that. None whatsoever."

Texto completo: It's been a long road for the Ducks' L.J. Mazzilli, the son of former Met and Yankee Lee Mazzilli. A drug suspension, a few down years, a trade and, finally, a release from the team that his father won a World Series with as a coach isn't exactly the minor-league path that the younger Mazzilli envisioned when the Mets drafted him out of UConn in 2013.
But, after all that, Mazzilli, 28, feels as good as he has in years and is ready to take back a career that has taken some harsh left turns on the way to Central Islip.
"I've felt really comfortable," said Mazzilli, who went 2-for-8 with two RBIs and three walks in his first three games with the Ducks. "I was actually telling my dad, 'I feel like myself when I was in 2014' - confident, calm, not jumpy and ready to hit the ball hard wherever it's pitched."
That season was Mazzilli's best year as a professional. He hit .301 with 29 doubles and 79 RBIs in 131 games in the Mets' system and was an All-Star in Class A. He hit .306 with seven RBIs in the Arizona Fall League.
But in December of that year, Mazzilli was suspended 50 games without pay for violating baseball's minor-league drug policy, testing positive for a second time for a "drug of abuse'' - a distinction that includes, but isn't limited to, recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy and doesn't include performance-enhancing drugs, according to The New York Times.
"I was young and immature," Mazzilli said. "It puts a lot of things into perspective, not only baseball, but your life, your family, your friends, and people that mean the most to you ... When that happened to me, it was a big speed bump. I had to take that time to self-reflect and see who I wanted to be as a person and where I was headed. I did that. I took it head on, and when I came back, all I really wanted to do was make everybody proud and show them that I am a good person. People make mistakes and you can come back from that."
Mazzilli hit .261 with 25 RBIs in 91 games, mainly at the Double-A level, in the Mets' system in 2015 and .239 with 43 RBIs in 122 games in 2016. He was traded to the Yankees in April 2018 for minor-leaguer Kendall Coleman. Mazzilli hit .243 with 25 RBIs in 79 games with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 2018 and was released this March, on the last day of spring training.
"That's the worst time to be released because all the rosters are set on that day. Openings weren't there," Mazzilli said. "When I was home, I was staying ready and had to weigh options with my agent with what might be available in affiliated ball, independent ball and maybe overseas. I knew the Ducks and Wally [Backman, the manager] were an option, so I was kind of just staying ready and trying to come up with a decision that was best for my career with my dad. We came to a point where it was time to play and time to play for Wally."
Mazzilli had played for Backman in the Mets' system and wanted another go-round with his father's former teammate.
"He's one of the best coaches I've ever played for and one of the best baseball minds I've ever been around," Mazzilli said.
The feeling was mutual. Backman had always admired Mazzilli's swing and, after being so close with his father, knew he was getting the kind of player he covets.
"You know that they've been taught the game the right way," Backman said of players who grow up around MLB fathers. "You don't see the stupid baserunning mistakes that happen a lot of the time. They've all been taught the right way."

House panel issues subpoenas for Trump's tax returns

Texto completo: Treasury secretary, IRS chief given until Friday to turn them over
A House committee issued subpoenas Friday ordering Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over President Trump's tax returns by Friday at 5 p.m., according to copies of the subpoenas provided by the committee.
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) authorized the subpoenas following months of disagreements with the Trump administration over whether federal law mandates that Congress can obtain the records.
"The IRS is under a mandatory obligation to provide the information requested," the subpoena states. "The IRS has had more than four weeks to comply with the Committee's straightforward request. Therefore, please see the enclosed subpoena."
Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign, a break with decades of precedent from previous presidents. Legal experts have said Mnuchin's refusal to turn over the returns is unprecedented, noting a 1924 law that explicitly gives lawmakers the authority to seek the records. A Treasury Department spokeswoman confirmed receipt of the subpoena.
The subpoenas come amid a widening legal conflict between House Democrats and the White House over a range of oversight issues, with the administration invoking executive privilege to prevent Trump's former counsel from giving certain records to Congress.
Neal first demanded six years of Trump's personal and business returns, from 2013 to 2018, in letters to the administration last month.
Neal's subpoenas demand that Mnuchin and Rettig turn over Trump's individual income tax returns, all "administrative files" such as affidavits for those income tax returns, and income tax returns for a number of Trump's business holdings such as the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, an umbrella entity that controls dozens of businesses, including the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.
The Trump administration has rejected Democrats' requests for the president's tax returns as violations of taxpayer privacy, with an attorney hired by the president and congressional Republicans echoing similar concerns. Mnuchin repeatedly asked for more time to respond to Neal's request before rejecting it outright earlier this month.
"I think we're coming to the point where we're running out of letters to write," Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview Thursday.
If Mnuchin and Rettig do not turn over the returns, Neal could respond by going to a congressional body to authorize a lawsuit in federal court against the two Trump administration officials. That body, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, is controlled by Democrats.
The subpoena could bolster Neal's position in federal court because it would help him demonstrate that he pursued all possible avenues to obtain the returns before filing a lawsuit against the administration, said Steve Rosenthal, a legal expert at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. That, at least in theory, would make it less likely for the court to strike down his claim on procedural grounds.
"A week now could save many months later," Rosenthal said.
Even if House Democrats receive Trump's tax returns, there is no guarantee they will be made public. Legal experts say leaking the returns is a violation of privacy law that could be punishable with up to five years in prison, a provision intended to ensure taxpayer privacy, said George Yin, a legal expert at the University of Virginia.
Earlier this week, the New York Times published a report, based on data from 10 years of Trump's federal tax returns, showing Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses to the IRS and lost more money than almost every other U.S. taxpayer from 1985 to 1994.
Earlier on Friday, Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, cautioned Neal against issuing a subpoena. "Such actions would be an abuse of the committee's oversight powers and further examples of the Democrat majority's coordinated attempt to weaponize the tax code," he argued.

Commentary: I led a platoon in Iraq. Trump is wrong to pardon war criminals.

Texto completo: In early 2003, as a cavalry officer, I stood in front of my scout platoon at dusk after a long day preparing to deploy to Iraq. I spoke with them about the law of war and how they should treat civilians when we got into theater. It wasn't a long conversation, but I felt that giving clear guidance about what was acceptable - and not acceptable - was important. They should treat the civilians as they would neighbors, I told them.
Soldiers take most seriously the things their leadership makes most serious.
On Monday, President Donald Trump pardoned the convicted war criminal Michael Behenna, who had murdered Ali Mansur, an unarmed, naked Iraqi, by shooting him in the head and chest. Making a specious claim of self-defense, Behenna argued that Mansur threw a piece of concrete at him and "stood up like he's coming at me." And so he neutralized this threat, a naked man, already released by the Army.
Behenna was supposed to be returning Mansur home to his village. A military court convicted Behenna of unpremeditated murder. American soldiers testified against him. The military court of appeals and a review panel upheld that conviction, though he was paroled early, in 2014.
Even before pardoning Behenna, Trump demonstrated a disturbing flippancy toward war crimes. He has repeatedly expressed support for former Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, another alleged war criminal. Gallagher's own men told investigators that he had, according to the New York Times, "shot a girl in a flower-print hijab who was walking with other girls on the riverbank." In 2017, Gallagher walked up to a 15-year-old prisoner of war and "stabbed the wounded teenager several times in the neck and once in the chest with his hunting knife, killing him." He then texted images of his "kill" to friends.
Even in the tightknit Special Operations community, fellow SEALs were horrified and repeatedly reported Gallagher’s behavior until charges were brought. He faces court-martial at the end of the month. Trump tweeted that Gallagher would be given better conditions in confinement “in honor of his past service,” an honor many would say he threw away long ago.
Trump has also publicly supported Maj. Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with premeditated murder in the shooting of an unarmed man and the burning of his body in Afghanistan.
"I will be reviewing the case of a ‘U.S. Military hero,’ " the president tweeted.
In at least three instances, then, our commander in chief appears to have preferred to overlook serious war crimes in favor of a warped notion of patriotism and heroism. Trump subscribes to a "bad things happen in war" mentality - odd for a man who actively avoided military service.
This attitude is incredibly dangerous. It doesn't just undermine the enforcement of military justice; it also sends a message to our armed forces about just what kind of conduct the United States takes seriously.
In my book "Marching Into Darkness," I wrote about the German army's participation in the Holocaust at the small-unit level. One conclusion was that, even given the premeditated, racist and highly ideologized environment of the Wehrmacht, the culture of each unit and the institutional leadership most directly influenced whether war crimes were committed. Murderous leaders led murderous units, I found.
Fortunately, the U.S. military does not exist in this kind of ethical quagmire. Compared with our opponents in the modern age, we have taken much more care to prosecute warfare in accordance with the laws of war. We have systems of military education that highlight our values and the law of armed conflict. And we have a military justice system that, while not perfect, prosecutes and condemns those service members who commit atrocities. In short, we have a foundation of military ethics that our combat leaders can stand on.
But what happens when that ethical foundation erodes or crumbles? There are things we can learn from the German military and the Holocaust that are relevant today - without arguing that we are Nazis. One lesson is the influence of an institution's culture on criminal behavior during wartime. The German state intentionally created such a culture (another important distinction from the current situation). Before a German soldier set foot in the Soviet Union, he received several unmistakable clues about what behavior would be acceptable. The Commissar Order explicitly called for the summary execution of all Red Army political officers, an act that violated all laws of war, including those that Germany was party to.
Also, the guidelines for German troops, disseminated the day before the invasion, stated that “this war demands ruthless and aggressive action against Bolshevik agitators, snipers, saboteurs, and Jews and tireless elimination of any active or passive resistance.” “Passive resistance” would be interpreted liberally.
Last, and most striking in light of Trump’s pardon of Behenna, was the Jurisdiction Order. Issued in May 1941 directly from Adolf Hitler, it informed troops that “for offenses committed by members of the Wehrmacht and its employees against enemy civilians, prosecution is not compulsory, not even if the offense is at the same time a military crime or violation.” Soldiers were literally told that they would not be tried for behavior that would be a crime anywhere else in Europe.
The Wehrmacht proceeded to commit some of the worst atrocities in the history of modern warfare on a scale that obviously dwarfs anything we have seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. But the underlying lessons remain valid. Murderous leaders led murderous units. Soldiers took their cues from the guidance they were given and the examples they were shown. They were often more likely to commit war crimes because of their commanders' signaling than because of Nazi ideology. (In my research on the Wehrmacht, I also discovered the corollary to be true: Leaders opposed to criminality led units that did not commit crimes.)
Trump's championing of war criminals as brave patriots who are simply victims of political correctness seems to push for a climate that condones unethical and criminal behavior. He appears to write off war crimes as the cost of doing business. If this is the example our military is given, we should not be surprised to see more Behennas and Gallaghers.
Referring to the infamous Army “kill team” in Afghanistan in 2009-2010, a senior military official noted the importance of the brigade commander’s aggressive guidance, which rejected any attempt to “win hearts and minds.” The official observed that “clearly, the guys who were pulling the trigger are the proximate cause of the crime, but the culture itself is the enabler.”
No reasonable person would claim that Trump is Hitler or that the U.S. military is the German army in World War II. Cases like those stand out as so horrific precisely because the American military has the strong ethical foundation the Wehrmacht lacked and generally does not commit war crimes. But the dynamics of units in combat at ground level can be strikingly similar across time and space, and so we ignore historical lessons at our peril. Perhaps that's why one case study from my research on the German army and the Holocaust forms the foundation of a training module for the U.S. military in conjunction with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and West Point. It is used by ROTC programs and military units across the country.
Leaders are constantly making policy, by what they do - and by what they don't do. Trump's posture endangers our deployed men and women by betraying the trust of host nations that we will prosecute those rare individuals who commit crimes against their people.

Trump's economy is strong, but Obama's was stronger

Texto completo: "We're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business you're not even going to believe it," President Trump told an American Farm Bureau Federation meeting in January. The attendees cheered.
Meanwhile, farmer income for the first three months of this year fell almost $12 billion. Farmers account for only 2 percent of all employed Americans, but the drop-off in their income was such that it suppressed the entire nation's personal income growth number for March.
I'm convinced that even as Trump recharges the trade war responsible for so much pain, his many fans in agricultural America would still whoop at his punch lines. If they didn't stop long ago as their misery mounted, why would they now?
You've got to hand it to Trump. His talent for seducing and entertaining his audiences is extraordinary. That takes genuine skill, and it's also a useful means to hide a less impressive reality. Trump campaigned as a genius dealmaker who would spread his magic formula for getting rich across the land.
Trump's supporters ignored evidence to the contrary. His six bankruptcies were public knowledge. Way back in 1987, as Trump's Atlantic City investments were crashing, The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a headline reading "Bankers Say Trump May Be Worth Less Than Zero." A new report in The New York Times documents a decade of carnage (1985 to 1994), when Trump lost over $1 billion.
In 1988, when he lost almost $47 million, he announced, "If the world goes to hell in a handbasket, I won't lose a dollar." In 1990, when he lost over $400 million, he said, "It's been good financially."
And his skilled spinning has hypnotized a usually sophisticated media into declaring this an era of amazing economic prosperity. Many of the indicators show strong growth for sure, but a look at the graphs of the decadelong expansion portrays the Trump years as mostly a continuation of the Obama years.
In terms of job creation, they're not as good. The much-heralded jobs number for April was indeed welcome. It brought the average number of jobs created during the 28-month Trump presidency to 202,000 a month. But in Obama's last 28 months, job growth averaged 220,000 a month. In 2014, he could have bragged of an average 251,000 a month but didn't.
To soundtrack to the news of 3.2 percent economic growth for the first quarter, Trump activated the nation's marching bands. Under Obama, however, the quarterly gross national product quietly surpassed 3 percent growth eight times. In four of the quarters, it rose 4 percent or better.
In not-so-good news, the deficit under Trump will jump from 3.5 percent of the economy in 2017 to 5.1 percent in 2019. Piling up debt in good times will make digging out of bad times harder.
Back in the heartland, farm income rose in December only because the government sent out checks to cover some losses caused by the trade war. To be fair to Trump, farmers were also hurt by low prices for their commodities. And some confrontation with China was needed to change its unfair trading practices.
Unfortunately, Trump has been taunting the Chinese. He accuses them of wanting to delay negotiations until a "very weak" Democrat is president. That's entertainment mode, not business mode.
Trade deficits are a much-misused measure of economic health. But since they are one of Trump's favorite yardsticks, do note that the U.S. trade deficit has reached its all-time high under him .
Humiliating the other side is not a clever negotiating tactic, assuming results are the goal. A businessperson would want to close the deal. An entertainer wants the show to go on.

Something Drunken This Way Comes

Texto completo: Imagine "Macbeth," but with a five-person cast that includes an inebriated actor in the title role. Add a prop dildo, an interpretive dance break and the president's rousing speech from "Independence Day." For the witches' brew, stir together samples from the plentiful cocktails poured for audience members.
Drink up!
Something like that is the formula behind "Drunk Shakespeare," which over the last five years has become an unlikely Off Off Broadway hit. After a bumpy start, the show has earned such strong word of mouth that producers this month refurbished an old fast-food restaurant to open a Chicago edition.
It might seem as if "Drunk Shakespeare" were inspired by "Drunk History" -- a 2007 web series turned Comedy Central mainstay that features a tipsy narrator retelling a historical event as actors lip sync his tale. In fact, another stage show of this ilk got the ball rolling (and is now a competitor of sorts).
Scott Griffin, an Australian tech entrepreneur, saw a show called "_______ Shakespeare" at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and wanted to present it in New York, but couldn't secure the rights. Instead he approached David Hudson of Three Day Hangover, a company that already presented classic plays in bars, about creating their own soused Shakespeare.
Their "Macbeth" began performances at the now shuttered Quinn's Bar and Grill in March 2014. Mr. Griffin said the original capitalization was $ 165,000, the majority of which came from his own pocket. It lost money during its six-month run.
However, he decided to remount the show at a more legit space, the also-now-shuttered Times Square Arts Center. Ticket sales began to increase. In 2016, a New York Times reviewer named it a Critic's Pick.
The show has moved twice since and is now at the 777 Theater, in a setting that took approximately $ 200,000 to build. Capacity is 135; patrons sit on benches or movable wooden chairs in a circle around the performance space. Some 15,000 books surround the audience.
But it's not the library atmosphere that helped the show recoup its budget in about 18 months, seen by upward of 45,000 people in nearly 500 performances last year alone, according to Mr. Griffin.
Ticket prices are comparatively low, generally ranging from $ 55 to $ 89, with plenty of business done through discount resellers. Marketing efforts include outreach to hotel concierges and influencers, occasionally putting out fliers and contests on dating and wedding sites.
Neither major advertising, nor a particularly active social media presence, can account for the success, however.
"I don't think the magic is in one thing," Mr. Griffin said. "As often as possible, something outrageous in the performance drives word of mouth."
Audience members interviewed at recent performances had indeed heard about the show from friends. They said they generally liked it, though some had trouble following the "Macbeth" plot.
And if the Shakespeare in the show's title wasn't to everyone's liking, the show's other selling point had its fans.
"I drank six shots before the free entry shot," said Samuel Ackers, 27, after an 8 p.m. performance. "When in Rome, or Scotland, or something."
"Drunk Shakespeare" offers an atmosphere of raunchy chaos that turns out to be carefully ordered. Along with the radically abbreviated "Macbeth," the performers arrive with scripted bits of humor, and room is left for improvisation.
Because there is audience interaction, the five-person ensemble comes to suss out the room before the performance begins, getting a sense of how people look, who could be teased, and who might go along with being touched or brought physically into the action.
Aubrey Taylor remembered a fellow actor playing Macbeth reaching into a woman's bag to get a prop and finding purchases from the Museum of Sex.
Mariah Parris, another cast member, spoke about three women who were there to honor their recently deceased grandmother, who dreamed of coming to New York. The actors incorporated the grandmother's name into the show.
Drinking is not part of the audition process, nor is it rehearsed. It just is. One actor -- never the narrator -- does at least five shots of his or her choosing and drinks the witches' concoction to get things going. On nights when there is both an 8 p.m. show and a 10 p.m. show, the same actor drinks at both performances. Hydration and food are key.
"The witches' brew is gross," said Ms. Taylor, following a doubleheader drinking and performing as Lady Macbeth. "They put pita in it and I want to lie and say I'm gluten-free, but then I remember the Domino's I ate last night onstage."
As a nonunion show, "Drunk Shakespeare" has great flexibility. There are 10 actors in the company, though only five go on at a time. It plays a minimum of seven performances per week, but went up to 18 Christmas week last year. Mr. Griffin sometimes adds performances week-of if sales are strong. Each actor is paid $ 100 per show (with extra for rehearsal). The landlord, who holds the liquor license, makes money off the drinks and limited snacks.
No one at Drunk Shakespeare wants you to worry about an actor's health (or destroy yours). The actors in it don't typically drink socially anymore. And the website warns: "We do not condone excessive drinking. Our drunk actors are on a regular rotation system and are carefully monitored at all times."
"Drunk Shakespeare" doesn't have a formal budget, but there would be some unusual line items if it did. There are dry cleaning or replacement expenditures if a patron's clothes or accessories get damaged because of spills or, as happened, an audience member vomiting in another's designer purse.
Additionally, drunk people tend to steal. A pair of crowns, worn by audience members, were once crafted by an artisan, but have had to be replaced so many times that one of them is now a more budget-conscious cake tin.
"Drunk Shakespeare" began performances in Chicago on May 2. For that production, capitalized at $ 1 million, the team turned an old fast-food restaurant into a space with a false locksmith's shop facade and a speakeasy vibe inside. Major costs include construction, a 10-year lease and the expenses associated with having a liquor license (which the production company itself will hold in Chicago).
Expanding the show to other cities, rather than to bigger spaces, is the goal. "There's a laugh track that has to happen for you to enjoy 'Drunk Shakespeare,"' Mr. Griffin said. "If you have a big room with only a few people in it, that doesn't work."
Despite the show's success, Mr. Griffin acknowledged that the formula doesn't always work. His Brass Jar Productions presented "Trainspotting Live" in the same building last year, which he estimates lost about $ 300,000.
Meanwhile, the beyond-drunk Shakespeare production that Mr. Griffin initially wanted to bring to the United States eventually arrived in 2015 and now plays weekly in Boston; Austin, Tex.; and Atlanta. Plans are in the works for Pittsburgh and Chicago.

James Comey inflicts 'damage' to FBI when he bashes Trump, ex-FBI assistant director says

Texto completo: A former top FBI official says James Comey does "damage" to the bureau every time he publicly condemns President Trump.
In a piece for USA Today, former FBI Assistant Director Mark Morgan, who is Trump's pick to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, deals harsh criticism of his former boss.
“He is telling the world now that he thinks the president is amoral. That opinion just didn’t come out of thin air on the day he was fired,” Morgan said. “As a former director of the FBI, when he speaks, he still brings the full force of credibility of that position, and so he’s not an average citizen when he speaks, and he knows that … Every time he speaks, every time he does an op-ed, he continues to do damage to the FBI.”
Morgan was citing a New York Times op-ed in which Comey called Trump an "amoral leader" who corrupted Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over their rollout of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.
Comey has spoken out several times in the past several weeks. He has repeatedly rebutted Barr's assertion that "spying" occurred against the Trump campaign. He also participated in a CNN town hall Thursday evening, on the two-year anniversary of Trump firing him, during which he said "it sure looks like" Trump obstructed justice and would have been charged if he were not president.
Trump lashed out at Comey after the town hall ended. "James Comey is a disgrace to the FBI & will go down as the worst Director in its long and once proud history," he tweeted. "He brought the FBI down, almost all Republicans & Democrats thought he should be FIRED, but the FBI will regain greatness because of the great men & women who work there!"
In his report Mueller details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but declines to say whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. Although Barr said he and Rosenstein determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, Democrats argue that Mueller's report leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.
Comey, who left the Republican Party and has urged the public to vote for Democrats in 2020, says Mueller laid out a path for a future prosecutor to "take a serious look at charging" Trump after he is out of office.
Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but "if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it."

Texto completo: Anita Hill’s act is getting very old. Actual victims of rape and sexual assault should reject her attempts to co-opt their pain.
In an op-ed for the New York Times, Hill said her 1991 Senate testimony against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas could have been the original beginning of the #MeToo movement. If only, she said, the Senate Judiciary Committee, headed at the time by Joe Biden, D-Del., “had done its job and held a hearing that showed that its members understood the seriousness of sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence.”
That’s where the record scratches. If Hill wants to proclaim herself the real founder of #MeToo, that’s between her and the movement. But she should never get away with attempting to redefine the term “violence” to include unwanted conversation, which was all she ever accused Thomas of doing.
#MeToo started with the shocking takedown of Harvey Weinstein, the hoggish movie mogul who was heard on tape admitting to having sexually assaulted a model by grabbing her breasts. Other claims against Weinstein were that he would invite unsuspecting women to his hotel room to watch him shower or give him a massage and that he would dangle movie opportunities over their heads so that they’d accept his sexual advances.
Hill, on the other hand, alleged that Thomas described to her a pornographic movie he had seen and she said that he once made a comment to her about pubic hair. She never testified that he so much as laid a finger on her.

There were also a lot of problems with Hill’s testimony — inconsistencies, contradictions, and a pattern of friendly phone calls she had initiated with Thomas. But even if you assume that everything she said was accurate, nothing Thomas is accused of could have rationally been described as “violence.”
Hill has also become a revisionist. In her op-ed she wrote that “The world didn’t really begin to come to grips with the prevalence of sexual abuse until 2017, when the millions of survivors who became the #MeToo movement demolished the myth that sexual violence was insignificant.”
The potency of the #MeToo movement wasn't that anyone had previously considered “sexual violence” unimportant. It was that powerful men, including major Democratic donors like Weinstein, could finally be exposed and held to account for their misconduct.
Hill wrote that the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, accused of a sexual assault dating back to when he was in high school, meant that “a new generation was forced to conclude that politics trumped a basic and essential expectation: that claims of sexual abuse would be taken seriously.”
If the Kavanaugh hearing was in any way a setback for victims of sexual abuse, it’s solely due to the ridiculous nature of the claims he faced, which included allegations that he was involved in a gang rape and that he — sit down for this one — got drunk as a teenager. That those uncorroborated claims were considered at all is a testament to the gravity with which sexual abuse claims are regarded.
The real lesson from the Kavanaugh episode was that the accused are entitled to due process and a presumption of innocence, something Hill, as a law professor, certainly understands at least in theory.
“Survivors and their supporters need acknowledgment and justice,” wrote Hill. But she’s not talking about "justice" justice. The idea that “sexual violence” means anything you want it to mean, and that no accuser should undergo scrutiny, isn’t real justice. It’s social justice, a fraudulent justice that demands we reorder traditions of fairness and the right to due process so that anyone who claims to have been aggrieved has absolute power to take down their supposed oppressor.
Hill is appropriating #MeToo and the anguish of rape and sexual assault survivors for political purposes. For whatever reason, she's still angry with Biden, and her attempt to kneecap his campaign is a proxy for promoting social justice. She shouldn’t get away with it, and real victims of sexual violence should stop her.

Resumen: Farewell to Rod Rosenstein becomes pep rally at DOJ in harsh spotlight of Mueller inquiry

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A day after being cited for contempt, Attorney General William Barr looked no worse for the rare rebuke.
Barr, in his first public appearance since the House Judiciary Committee took action against the attorney general for refusing to turn over an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report, wore a broad smile as he presided over a farewell ceremony for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Drawing howls of laughter, the attorney general did not hesitate to address the congressional admonishment, suggesting that it "must be a record" for the first 100 days of any attorney general's tenure.
He then called the guest of honor, Rosenstein, to his side to re-enact a much-mocked scene from a Justice Department briefing just prior to last month's release of Mueller's report when Rosenstein stood stone-faced behind his boss, prompting a comic viral surge on Twitter.
"I do my best work at congressional hearings," Barr said, referring to his own combative appearance last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Rod does his best work standing behind the attorney general. "

More: Barr vs. Mueller: The attorney general fights his own battle with the special counsel as he stands up for Trump
While Thursday's ceremony was staged to honor Rosenstein's three-decades at the department, it was transformed into a pep rally of sorts where former and current officials offered stirring defenses of an agency thrust into a harsh spotlight since Mueller's report was made public.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom President Donald Trump ousted largely because of his recusal from the Russia investigation, cited Rosenstein's unswerving leadership during "one of the most difficult times in the history of the department. "
Referring to Mueller by name, Sessions said the special counsel was "given the time and the support" to complete his work.
"At the end, in America, we are committed to a lawful process," Sessions said. "The system worked. What more can a public servant do?"
Sessions, who left the podium to a standing ovation, was only one in a roster of guests drawn to the department's cavernous Great Hall and who played singular roles in the 22-month inquiry that–despite its completion–continues to shake at the highest levels of the department.
Though Barr and Rosenstein, whose tumultuous tenure was defined by Mueller's investigation, were the unquestioned headliners of the event, others included former White House Counsel Don McGahn, perhaps the most quoted witness in the special counsel's scathing 448-page report; Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N. C. , whose committee continues its own inquiry of Russian interference; Matt Whitaker, who briefly served as acting attorney general following Sessions' ouster; and FBI Director Christopher Wray, who replaced James Comey after his abrupt dismissal because of his handling of the Russia inquiry.
Also not to be ignored was the symbolism of the very date of Thursday's ceremony: two years to the day of Comey's dismissal, an act that contributed to broadening Mueller's inquiry into an examination of whether Trump had sought to obstruct the investigation by firing the man who then ran it.
Because Mueller did not make a determination on the question of obstruction, Barr intervened in March, announcing in a summary of the special counsel's findings that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president with criminal obstruction.
Democrats have since seized on Barr's intervention, claiming that the attorney general acted to protect the president.
Outside of Mueller's team, however, the public weight of the past two years of investigation was mostly borne by Rosenstein who spent much that time on the verge of removal or resignation.
His oversight of Mueller's far-flung inquiry into Russian election interference often made him a favorite target of Trump, who once superimposed Rosenstein’s likeness behind prison bars in one of many tweets disparaging the president’s political enemies.
Among his first actions as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein authored a memorandum that Trump used as the basis for firing Comey.
Comey's firing so shook public confidence in the Russia inquiry that just days later, Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the investigation as a Justice Department special counsel.
Nonetheless, Rosenstein often found himself in the middle of a politically-charged battle in which Trump and congressional allies cast the deputy attorney general as a ringleader in partisan "witch hunt" while Democrats came to view the Republican as an unlikely guard against White House interference.
His tenure nearly came to a premature end last year when he mulled resignation in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that he suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.
Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
The incident prompted a hastily-called White House meeting where Rosenstein expected to be fired – only to return to Justice later that day with his status unchanged.
His relationship with Trump, while often fraught, appeared in recent months to settle, with Trump claiming in a January interview with the New York Times that the deputy attorney general had assured him that he was not a target of Mueller's probe.
In his resignation letter submitted last month, Rosenstein offered both gratitude to Trump and veiled references to the extraordinary challenges posed by the investigation that shadowed the first two years of Trump's administration.
On Thursday, the outgoing deputy attorney general summoned an unmitigated defense of the department and its handling of Mueller's report.
"The rule of law is not just a talking point for us," Rosenstein told the audience, "it is an operating principle. The rule of law requires us to ignore partisan politics, tune out the news cycle, and base our decisions on credible evidence.
"We stayed the course and we accomplished what we set out to do," he said. "I leave here confident that justice is in good hands; it is in your hands. "

Texto completo: There's a moment in the third season of "Santa Clarita Diet" where, shortly after Timothy Olyphant's Joel Hammond almost disparages his undead wife by calling her a zombie - "zom ... body," he pivots - he suggests they kill another undead person to prevent more harm to others.
Sheila (Drew Barrymore), his wife, balks and suggests that they extend a bit more courtesy to the undead. Joel, a human, remarks that the undead "eat people," to which she responds, "So do I, Joel. But I'm also much more than that, and no matter how much good I'm doing, is that all you're ever gonna see?"
He does see past it, but the casual Netflix viewer might not - even after three seasons, "Santa Clarita Diet" is still often reduced to "the Drew Barrymore zombie show."
Last week, Netflix wound up canceling the series, which fell through the cracks despite its A-list leads, their charismatic performances and the surprisingly authentic relationship showcased by the Hammonds' antics.
"Santa Clarita Diet" might be over, but as Sheila would point out, death doesn't signify the end. Netflix users can still stumble upon this odd gem, which began two years ago with Sheila projectile vomiting while she and Joel, married real estate agents in southern California, show a house to potential buyers. She dies in the bathroom and comes back to "life," without a heartbeat and with intense cravings for raw flesh.
The show follows the Hammonds' attempts to keep Sheila's undead state under wraps, with help from their stubborn teenage daughter, Abby (Liv Hewson), and their geeky neighbor, Eric (Skyler Gisondo), who'll do anything to spend time with Abby.
The mystery of why the show lacked a renewal-worthy following deepens when considering the largely positive reviews it garnered. When the first season hit Netflix, the New York Times praised the use of "zombification as the route to midlife rejuvenation," while the Boston Globe applauded creator Victor Fresco ("Better Off Ted") for his mastery of the show's "droll, perverse humor." The Atlantic noted that "if you can get with the gore, there's frequently a sweet, oddball marital comedy fighting to get out."
The comedy leaned into its screwball nature more and more with each season, a trend matched by stronger ratings: Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 78 percent rating, the second an 89 percent rating and the third a solid 100. As a friend pointed out, "Santa Clarita Diet" thrives when it abides by improv comedy's "Yes, and" principle.
Both Barrymore, who took on the role during a difficult time in her life because of how much she loved the script, and Olyphant, who found the right stage to show off his comedic chops, seemed more than happy to oblige. Despite being the show's rationalizing straight man, Joel will almost always go along with Sheila's plans, no matter how absurd.
Consider, for instance, the opening scene of the show's second episode. Joel digs a hole in which to bury the remains of a loathsome colleague Sheila killed while she cheerfully tells him about a listing they might be able to snag: "Guess what Kelly told me last night?" Sheila says. "She and Ben are selling their home. It's a beautiful property." Joel affirms her excitement through gritted teeth - "That'd be great, honey. We can't be realtors if we don't have listings!" - but seems more bothered by Sheila misplacing the lid of the container holding the colleague's body parts than by the gruesome murder itself.
Similar to the vampire-centric "What We Do in the Shadows," an FX series based on the cult film of the same name, "Santa Clarita Diet" derived its humor from the mundanities of life as a bloodthirsty creature - at the end of the day, the Hammonds are just an unconventional suburban couple trying to run a successful real estate business.
The show's tone struck a halfway point between melodramatic and blase, a tricky balance maintained by Barrymore and Olyphant's complementary performances. Whereas Sheila is light and erratic, Joel holds down the fort with restraint and reason. They brought the star power, but Hewson and Gisondo, who will soon be seen on the big screen with Olivia Wilde's "Booksmart," rounded out the talented main cast. (Not to mention Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Natalie Morales and Joel McHale in supporting roles.)
With three seasons of 10 episodes each, "Santa Clarita Diet" is a quick and lighthearted watch. Fresco and fellow executive producer Tracy Katsky wrote a farewell note to disappointed fans in a similar style late last week: "Everything ends. This was a thing. And so it ended," they captioned an Instagram post. "We'll miss it but we are proud of the work we did and will always appreciate the love and enthusiasm we felt from our audience." The note also included statements from a grateful Barrymore and from Olyphant, whose devotion to the work seemed akin to Joel's.
"I loved working on this show," he wrote. "I'm going to continue coming in and doing scenes. If they don't want to film it, that's up to them."

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (May 13-July 6). The Italian theatrical form commedia dell'arte, popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, introduced the mischievous Harlequin and the object of his affection, Columbine, whose father attempts to thwart their playful relationship. Marius Petipa made a ballet of their antics in 1900, and Alexei Ratmansky reimagined it, based on Petipa's notes, for Ballet Theater, where he is the artist in residence. Ratmansky's cheery "Harlequinade" made its debut last June, and now it kicks off the company's spring season with a week of performances.

DANCE BROOKLYN at City Tech Theater (May 11, 7 p.m.). This annual celebration of Brooklyn-based dance companies is a smorgasbord of global styles. Participants will include Something Positive Inc., which will contribute a dance reflecting an Afro-Caribbean blend of African and French social styles; the Brooklyn Irish Dance Company, which will perform an excerpt from "A Celtic Christmas Story"; and Ninja Ballet, which fuses ballet and martial arts. Other artists will add salsa and belly dancing to the mix. This free event is presented by Purelements, an East Brooklyn arts organization and dance company that will do a work by Hollie Wright.

SIMONE FORTI, STEVE PAXTON AND YVONNE RAINER at Dancespace Project (May 16-17, 8 p.m.). Forti, Paxton and Rainer first met in 1960 while studying under the modern dance pioneers Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. A few years later they forged another path, participating in the founding of Judson Dance Theater, which ushered dance into its postmodern phase. They have remained influential artists ever since, and all have written books. This event reunites them for performative readings of their material, illustrating an important narrative thread in the story of American dance.

LA MAMA MOVES! DANCE FESTIVAL at LaMama's Ellen Stewart Theater (through May 26). This eclectic annual festival features local and global artists hailing from China, South Korea and Norway, among other countries, curated, as from the beginning, by Nicky Paraiso. This week, the choreographer Hari Krishnan, whose work draws on both queer theory and South Indian dance, presents four pieces that each dissect, satirize or subvert cultural stereotypes (Sunday, 7 p.m.; Monday, 3 p.m.). From Wednesday to May 19, Bobbi Jene Smith, a magnetic former member of the Batsheva Dance Company who now makes her own raw, mesmerizing work, offers "Lost Mountain," which she performs in along with 11 other musicians and dancers.
212-475-7710, lamama.org
NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). For the first time, the work of City Ballet's founding choreographer, George Balanchine, and that of its current resident choreographer, Justin Peck, are on a program together (Friday, Tuesday and Thursday), cementing Peck's status as the heir apparent and the shaper of the company's modern identity. In between, spread over two shows and mixed in with other Balanchine classics, Peck's latest piece and new dances by Pam Tanowitz and Gianna Reisen enjoy a few encores. On Wednesday, Balanchine gets his own program that comprises the large-scale "Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet" and "Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3."

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
JODY OBERFELDER at the Flea Theater (May 15-18, 7 p.m.; through May 19). This week, Oberfelder concludes her trilogy examining the biological wonder and symbolic meanings of our bodies. In 2013, she focused on the heart in "4Chamber" and, in 2017, turned to the head in "The Brain Piece." Her latest, "Madame Ovary," explores gender and the anatomy of sex, using Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" as a point of reference to track how far we have and have not come in conceptualizing gender and its social role. Oberfelder's multimedia approach includes dance, film, spoken word and an original score by Missy Mazzoli.

PARSONS DANCE at the Joyce Theater (May 14-15, 7:30 p.m.; May 16-17, 8 p.m.; through May 26). When Paul Taylor's "Runes" had its premiere in 1981, the New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff called it "spellbinding." One of its performers, David Parsons, went on to form his own company and create dozens of attractive, athletic dances. For its two-week residency at the Joyce, Parsons Dance will perform "Runes" in tribute to Taylor, who died in August. The program will also include Trey McIntyre's "Eight Women," which honors another recently deceased artist, Aretha Franklin; Parson's own "Nascimento"; and his enduring light trick dance, "Caught."

SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (May 12, 6 p.m.). Five years ago, Cathy Weis opened up her downtown loft for this intimate series of one-off performances, readings and discussions by veteran artists and newer voices. This week, she curates the offering with Emily Climer. The participants are Daniel Lepkoff and Sakura Shimada, whose work explores the practice of physical communication; Kota Yamazaki, who performs a solo that references his recently completed "Darkness Odyssey" trilogy; and Doug LeCours, who does a duet with Anna Witenberg in which their bodies become atoms that attract, repel and collide.

VANGELINE THEATER at Theater for a New City (May 16-18, 8 p.m.; through May 19). Tatsumi Hijikata, a pioneer of the haunting postwar Japanese performance art butoh, once said, "Since the body itself perishes, it has a form. Butoh has another dimension." That idea of disappearing and tapping into another realm was a catalyst for "ɪˈreɪʒə (Erasure)" by the New York-based butoh artist Vangeline. In the hourlong solo, she attempts to render herself symbolically invisible so as to allow room for women who have been erased throughout history. The intention, she writes in an artist statement, is that they may then "come back and dance through me."

Democrats are rudderless heading into 2020 with a booming economy and without Russia

Texto completo: The Russia conspiracy theory is off the table and the economy is roaring. That leaves Democrats with just one cohesive issue to run on in 2020: their visceral distaste for President Trump.
Outside of that, there isn’t one theme, policy, or slogan among the 20-plus Democrats running for the nomination that’s inspiring any particular set of voters.
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is “trying to reset her campaign by taking on Trump.” She committed to that reset at an NAACP event on Sunday, boldly declaring in Johnnie Cochran-like cadence that “This president isn’t trying to make America great, he’s trying to make America hate.”
The Times said that Harris in recent days has seen “the value of elevating her voice of opposition to the president and seeking direct confrontation with the White House.”
That’s her moment of clarity? When Republicans ran against then-President Obama in 2012, at least there were major policy areas that animated their opposition: Obamacare, the droopy economy, and Obama's tepid approach to Islamic terrorism.
For Democrats, if it's not a personal campaign against Trump, it's nothing.
Joe Biden launched his campaign not with an upbeat narrative about continuing the Obama legacy (I wonder why), but by rehashing the media lie about Charlottesville and casting his campaign as a “battle for the soul of America.” He repeated that hammy line at a rally thereafter, undoubtedly praying that it would stick.
Beto O’Rourke was all but forgotten until Sunday, when he said Democrats’ favorite word: “Impeach.” Immediately thereafter, though, he was back to obscurity.
Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who believes in God and wants to make sure everybody is really, really aware of it, has an adoring media beneath his wings, but he’s never offered a reason for running. His most remarkable moment to date has been his one-sided fight with Vice President Mike Pence about being gay. Ah, yes, the grievance card. Always a crowd-pleaser in the party ruled by the twisted logic of intersectionality.
Buttigieg has admitted he’s not really about ideas at the moment. During a CNN town hall forum in late April, Anderson Cooper told him it was difficult to contrast his policy views with the other candidates because it’s unclear what they are. Buttigieg said his focus right now is introducing his “values” (and also, his website wasn’t ready yet for policy rollouts).
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are really giving it a go at convincing voters that the economy right now isn’t working for everyone, singing their golden oldies on free healthcare and free college tuition. Good luck with that — they’re both double digits behind Biden.
And poor Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. She has the right idea about her party, but she is just a little too desperate. On Sunday, she posted a video to her Facebook page of a man dressed in drag, thanking her for “sitting with a queer person, talking about queer issues.” The day before that, she pledged that if elected, “someone with disabilities” would be in her Cabinet. She is polling at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics national average.
Democrats are dried out on popular ideas. The party is in a crisis, and they all know it.

Only question is how much did FBI spyon Trump campaign

Texto completo: At his contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General William Barr dropped a big hint about his investigation into the conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.
"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant," Barr said. "I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it is being represented."
Here is what he meant: There has been a lot of discussion on the right about the FBI’s use of a confidential informant, an England-based college professor named Stefan Halper, to spy on some Trump campaign figures, including the sometime foreign policy volunteer advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. There has also been talk about the FBI’s use of a so-called FISA warrant — a court-approved permission to wiretap — against Page.
There was also speculation about other possible FBI surveillance, but the Halper operation and Page FISA case were the only ones definitely known. So Barr was saying that if the FBI really took the Trump-Russia matter seriously, if they thought it was a threat to the republic, would that be all they would do? No other wiretaps or other surveillance? No other confidential informants? Nothing?
Given that Barr was already looking into the question, his phrasing suggested he suspected there was more.
Sure enough, just days later, The New York Times reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI sent an undercover agent, a woman who went by the alias Azra Turk, to London to pose as Halper’s research assistant and tease information out of Papadopoulos. (The Times was so reluctant to call Turk a spy that it referred to her, in a headline, as a "cloaked investigator.") So now there are Halper, Turk and the Page FISA warrant. If they represent the totality of the FBI’s surveillance, that would still be a pretty anemic response to what some in the bureau viewed as a full-scale Russian attack on American democracy.
So the key question of the Barr investigation will be: Is there more? The answer is not publicly known. But consider this: The Mueller report noted that on Aug. 2, 2017, the Justice Department authorized the special counsel to investigate specific allegations against four Trump campaign officials: Page and Papadopoulos, plus former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former security adviser Michael Flynn. Is it reasonable to believe that the FBI pulled out the big investigative guns, the spies and the wiretap warrant, against the two smaller figures — Page and Papadopoulos — and not against the far more important figures of Manafort and Flynn? Or if not against them, perhaps against others?
It wasn’t that long ago, on April 10, when, during another Hill appearance, Barr set off a firestorm by declaring that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. Democrats pounced; how dare Barr call the FBI’s investigation "spying"?
"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of attorney general," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.
It is abundantly clear that Barr was correct. He was careful to add that the unknown factor about the spying was "whether it was adequately predicated" — that is, whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to do it. But there was no doubt that spying happened.
Now, the question is whether there was more than is now publicly known. Congressional investigators are anxiously awaiting the results of an investigation into at least some of the surveillance by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. That report is thought to be coming in the next couple of months. They are also watching to see what Barr will investigate on his own.
Both are deeply important efforts. Just as the public needed to know what is in the Mueller report, it needs to know about the FBI’s secret political operations in the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: I don't like to brag, but I am very busy. I am busy doing nothing, but it still counts. In fact, being busy doing nothing counts a lot more than being busy doing something.
If you doubt me, ask Olga Mecking.
Mecking is the author of "The Case for Doing Nothing," a recent article published in The New York Times.
The basic premise is that being busy has become a "status indicator." As in, "I'm so busy because I'm just so important."
But being busy does not make you important. It only makes you a target for "burnout, anxiety disorders and stress-related diseases."
This is not a problem in the Netherlands, in case you were wondering. In the Netherlands, being unbusy is a thing -- a thing called niksen.
In case your Dutch is a little rusty, niksen means "to take conscious, considered time and energy to do activities like gazing out a window or sitting motionless."
(If you have not progressed sufficiently in your career to have a window, walk over to the nearest manager's office and look out their window. They're so busy with their niksen, they'll never notice you.)
Alas, we live in a society where an ability to do niksen is not really appreciated. When was the last time you were dinged in your annual review for not spending enough time doing nothing?
According to psychologist Sandi Mann, niksen helps generate creativity, but there is a catch: "Total idleness is required."
You may think that you're really good at doing nothing, but think of all the times a highly productive burst of idleness was spoiled by your cellphone ringing or your email dinging.
In other words, you have to work hard to do nothing, but following the following rules could help:
1. "Make time for doing nothing, and do it with purpose."
The idea here is to "figure out when you're most productive and creative, then notice when your mind starts to shut off."
Easy-peasy. You are most creative in the period between leaving home and arriving at the office. Your brain is bursting with reasons for you not to go into work. It's when you're walking through the company's front door that your mind shuts off. At this point, the experts say, "That's when you should go for a walk or take a break."
I like this idea. Consider a nice walk to The Kit Kat Club, where your unproductive buds are practicing their niksen over artisanal boilermakers. Just be sure to start back to work by 5 p.m. You want to take full advantage of your next creative burst, which is when your brain dreams up all sorts of ideas for never going back to work again.
You are also advised to "prioritize the things that are important to you and the things that bring you pleasure, and outsource everything else."
Excellent idea! Your priorities are gossip, snacks and online shopping. Why not outsource the boring work stuff to a Third World country, like Nebraska? The people there will happily do your work for peanuts, freeing you up to do the kind of nothing that is sure to turbocharge your career.
2. "Resist the culture of busyness."
"If you're doing nothing, own it," is the advice here. "When someone asks you what you're doing during a nothing break, simply respond, 'Nothing.'"
Of course, if the someone asking is your manager -- who has woken up from their idle hours to check on you -- there is a better answer.
"Doing nothing," you say, adding, "but thinking about how much I admire you, boss."
(Be careful with this ploy. It probably won't work for longer than 20 years.)
3. "Reorganize your environment."
It is difficult to fully turn off when you're surrounded by unenlightened idiots running around being "productive."
That's why you are advised to "add a soft couch, a comfy armchair, a few cushions or just a blanket." This advice is for your home, but at work, it works even better.
If your work area is not large enough to hold all these niksen-friendly accoutrements, get rid of your computer, office chair and desk.
If you're still unable to detach from the destructive concept of doing something, psychologist Doreen Dodgen-Magee suggests you "host boredom parties, during which a host invites over a few friends to ... be bored together."
Make it easier on yourself by inviting the entire human resources department. They're already super boring, which means it won't take a lot of work for you to do absolutely nothing.

Texto completo: Whatever else you do between now and May 26, you should try to see “The Brothers Paranormal” at Penumbra. Here’s why.
1. It’s the first-ever co-production by Theater Mu, a major Asian American theater company, and Penumbra Theater, a major African American theater company. Two pathbreaking cultural institutions based in St. Paul, probably the only U.S. city that can claim both kinds of theater companies.
2. It’s written by Prince Gomolvilas, who calls himself the “world’s only Thai American playwright” (and insists he has built his entire career on that claim). Remember that name.
3. Billed as “a darkly comic thriller,” it’s genuinely scary in parts. On the night we saw it, after a scene that made most of us jump in our seats, two women near the front stood up and ran out.
4. It’s a really good story. An African American couple who fled the ravages of Katrina are haunted by what appears to be an Asian ghost with anger issues. The wife reaches out to a ghost-busting business started by two Thai brothers — one an immigrant, one born here to immigrant parents. Everyone in the play has been displaced. Everyone is grieving. No one is where they feel they belong.
5. It’s brilliantly written — spooky, touching, illuminating, funny, sad and sweet. Also serious and insightful about things like the immigrant experience and mental illness. We read the script afterward, and so many clues are scattered around it, so many sly hints dropped that we’d go again just to see it through that wised-up lens. (If you’ve ever seen David Mamet’s film “The Spanish Prisoner,” “The Brothers Paranormal” is kind of like that. Everything you need to know is right there in front of you. You just don’t recognize it. Like Mamet, Gomolvilas distracts you, then pulls the rug out from under you.)
6. It’s perfectly cast. You can’t do better than Sherwin Resurreccion (as Max, the brother born here), Kurt Kwan (Visarut, Max’s older brother), Leslie Ishii (Tasanee, their mother), Regina Marie Williams and James Craven (the loving African American couple whose lives are turned upside-down) and Michelle de Joya, an actor/dancer/acrobat/yoga instructor who brings all those skills to her role as Jai, the ghost. While the production does include some special effects, de Joya’s moves are all hers.
7. For a small theater without pots of money, the production is a standout. Big set pieces appear and go away. Moods are created and changed by sound and lighting. With no CGI, it’s still scary. All because of real people doing real things in real time. Old school can be amazing. Props to scenic designer Vicki Smith, costume designer Mathew LeFebvre, lighting designer Karin Olson, scound designer Scott Edwards and the directors, Lou Bellamy and assistant Sun Mee Chomet.
And that’s all we’ll say about this very special play. Except for this: “The Brothers Paranormal” includes some big surprises that deserve to be experienced in the theater, in the moment. So far, no one who has written about this production has leaked any spoilers. At least, no one we’ve read. Let’s keep up the good work, people.
“The Brothers Paranormal” continues at Penumbra through May 26, with performances Wednesdays through Sundays. FMI and tickets ($40/35/15). On the next two Sundays (May 12 and 19) at 6 p.m., Penumbra and Mu will host “Ghost Stories in the Park,” an evening of traditional Asian and African ghost tales — and treats from Sebastian Joe’s ice cream — in Martin Luther King Recreational Center Park at 271 Mackubin St., right beside the building where Penumbra is located. Both events are free and open to all ages.
P.S. If you’re wondering how Prince Gomolvilas got his first name, it was given to him by a kindergarten teacher in Indianapolis who couldn’t pronounce his Thai name, Khamolpat, or his nickname, Bin. So the teacher called him Prince.
The picks
Tonight (Wednesday, May 8) at the Cedar: My Brightest Diamond with Tunde Olaniran. Also known as Shara Nova, and before then Shara Worden, My Brightest Diamond was last in Minneapolis for the U.S. premiere of Sarah Kirkland Snider’s “Unremembered” with Liquid Music. Now she’s out with her own latest album, “A Million and One.” She is so unique, so smart, so seemingly boundless, equally at home in indie rock, classical and new music that it’s worth going to hear her no matter what she’s up to. She reminds us of Kate Bush and Björk and no one at all. Opening act Olaniran is a singer, songwriter, producer, rapper, choreographer, author, activist etc. from Flint, Michigan. Doors at 7 p.m. show at 7:30. All-ages standing show. FMI and tickets ($18/20).
Friday through Sunday from Harris to Shafer, Sunrise to Taylors Falls, North Branch to Lindstrom: 27th Annual St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour. Follow the red-pot-on-a-yellow-ground signs from studio to studio in this greatest of all Minnesota pottery tours. Eight career studio potters in seven locations will host 47 guest potters and welcome thousands of aficionados, collectors, and the curious. See, touch, hold, talk about and maybe bring home some of the high-quality, handmade functional pottery for which Minnesota is internationally known. Find the cup, bowl, plate or pitcher you’ll use for years. This show is also a major gift-buying opportunity and Christmas isn’t that far away. Here’s a map (you can pick up a printed version at the first studio you visit). Friday and Saturday 10 a.m.-6 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. FMI. This tour will be especially poignant for those who know the pottery scene. Robert Briscoe, one of the original founders, has retired, and this will be his final tour. Find him (and his pots) at Matt Krousey’s studio (formerly Bob’s studio) in Harris.
Starts Friday at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.” It took Terry Gilliam more than 25 years to make this film. Meanwhile, Adam Driver became a star in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and Jonathan Pryce took a star turn as the Sparrow in “Game of Thrones.” Here Driver is a cynical advertising director and Pryce a delusional shoemaker who believes himself to be Don Quixote, “born by the special will of Heaven to restore the lost age of chivalry.” RogerEbert.com called it “witty, goofy, and glorious,” the New York Times “a meeting of minds” between Gilliam and Cervantes himself. We had forgotten that Gilliam, the only American “Monty Python” member, was born in Minneapolis and raised in Medicine Lake. FMI including trailer, times and tickets.
Saturday in (mostly) Uptown: 4th Annual Lit Crawl. As if the Loft’s new Wordplay festival isn’t enough — it starts Friday and runs through Sunday, bringing a zillion authors to town for a big old books party — Lit Crawl will return to Uptown on Saturday night. (It started at 3 p.m. last year and will begin at 6 p.m. this year, giving time for people at Wordplay to Lyft, bus or bike to the other side of town.) Events at six different locations – Bryant Lake Bowl, Highpoint Center for Printmaking, Zoe’s Café, Morrissey’s Irish Pub and the Red Stag (wait, that’s not in Uptown) – will include a rock record party, literary bingo, Literary Death Match, Nerd Jeopardy, a pun contest and, you know, more. FMI.

Trump defiende su “trampa” para no haber pagado cientos de millones de dólares en impuestos

Texto completo: Una vez más queda en evidencia el tipo de presidente que tiene EEUU. Donald Trump defendió la forma en que logró evitar el pago de millones de dólares en impuestos durante más de diez años.
En contra de cualquier lógica el presidente Donald Trump respondió este miércoles al informe del New York Times que dijo que las cifras de sus impuestos desde 1985 hasta 1994 mostraron asombrosas pérdidas empresariales de más de 1,000 millones de dólares.
“Siempre quiso mostrar pérdidas a efectos fiscales … casi todos los promotores inmobiliarios lo hicieron, y con frecuencia volvieron a negociar con los bancos, fue un deporte”, dijo Trump en un par de tweets de la madrugada. “¡Además, la información muy antigua que se publicó es un trabajo muy incorrecto en las noticias falsas!”
Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” ……
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
….you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes….almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
El diario neoyorquino obtuvo la información fiscal de Trump, incluidas las impresiones de sus transcripciones oficiales de impuestos del IRS, de 1985 a 1994.
El periódico dijo que los datos extraídos de las impresiones de los recibos del IRS de Trump mostraron que perdió dinero cada año durante el período de 10 años, por una pérdida acumulada de $1.17 mil millones en total. The Times también dijo que Trump no pagó impuestos sobre la renta durante ocho de esos 10 años.
Al parecer, Trump perdió más dinero que cualquier otro contribuyente individual en todo EEUU, según el análisis de los datos de la investigación que el IRS ha compilado sobre las personas que ganan grandes ingresos.
Trump, sin embargo, sugirió que sus tácticas de “refugio fiscal” eran normales para el curso en los años 80 y 90, y dijo en sus tweets de la mañana del miércoles que los promotores inmobiliarios como él “tenían derecho a amortizaciones masivas y depreciación que, de ser así, Construyendo activamente, mostrar pérdidas y pérdidas fiscales en casi todos los casos “.
Queda claro una vez más la razón por la que Trump está inmerso en una batalla legal a muerte para evitar que se conozcan sus devoluciones de impuestos recientes, las cuales dejarían claro el origen de sus finanzas, sus nexos con gobiernos y oligarcas internacionales y demás maniobras para evitar el pago de impuestos.
Por su parte en Nueva York la legislatura estatal avanzó este miércoles un proyecto de ley que permitiría al Congreso obtener las declaraciones de impuestos estatales del magnate.
De igual forma legisladores en otros 17 estados también están tratando de obtener las declaraciones de impuestos de Trump antes de las elecciones de 2020.
Actualmente cursan en las distintas legislaturas estatales proyectos de ley que obligan a los candidatos presidenciales a hacer públicos los últimos cinco años de sus devoluciones de impuestos si quieren estar en la boleta electoral en 2020.

In SpeakEasy's 'School Girls,' notions of beauty tainted by shades of prejudice

Texto completo: On Monday, the New York Times reported that a significant milestone has just been reached: For the first time, the crowns of all three major beauty pageants — Miss America, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA — are simultaneously held by African-American women.
But deep within that story there was a caveat, voiced by Ashley Nkadi, a former Miss Black Ohio who has written about the lack of inclusivity in American beauty pageants. Nkadi noted that pageant winners do not tend to be “plus-size" and seldom have darker skin, adding, “I definitely still think the Eurocentric beauty model still dominates."
The prevalence of that model and the way it has given rise to “colorism," both outside and inside the black community, form the twin subjects of Jocelyn Bioh's “School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play." After premiering two years ago in New York under the direction of Rebecca Taichman (currently at the helm of Paula Vogel's “Indecent" at the Huntington Theatre Company), “School Girls" is now receiving a first-rate SpeakEasy Stage Company production, directed by Summer L. Williams.
Though deceptively small in scale and often comic in tone, “School Girls" packs a considerable emotional wallop. Set in a girls' boarding school in central Ghana in 1986, the play tracks the competition within a group of friends to become contestants in the Miss Ghana pageant, with the hope of going on to the “Miss Global Universe" pageant. It's not really much of a competition, though, because most of the girls expect the self-assured leader of their group, Paulina (Ireon Roach), to be chosen.
Until, that is, a lighter-skinned American transfer student named Ericka (Victoria Byrd) arrives at the school. Suddenly, the balance of power shifts, with implications for the worldview of Paulina (who might not be as confident as she appears) and also her hitherto cowed followers: Nana (Shanelle Chloe Villegas), Ama (Sabrina Victor), Mercy (Tenneh Sillah), and Gifty (Geraldine Bogard).
Bioh, whose parents immigrated from Ghana to the United States, know how to distribute the weight: She smartly does not overload her 80-minute play, and director Williams keeps it moving at a fleet pace. One of Williams's specialties is working with young actors, and that pays off here: Her endearing cast adeptly mines moments small and large for laughs. (An extended scene in which the girls take turns soloing on Whitney Houston's “The Greatest Love of All" is priceless.)
But beneath the animated surface of “School Girls" lie resonant and wrenching depths, and both Bioh and Williams make sure to take us there. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, “School Girls" suggests, we need to examine how much that vision has been clouded by invidious cultural assumptions that work against darker-skinned women. The play asks us to consider the ways in which discriminatory beauty standards can damage self-image.
At first, Roach's Paulina projects an air of absolute command. With every look, gesture, and icy vocal intonation, the actress captures the quintessence of the high school queen bee. When one of her friends laughs at a joke told by Ericka, Roach's Paulina swivels her head and freezes the girl with a glare. Playwright Bioh clearly understands, however, that not just intimidation but seeming to be in the know can vault you to the top of a social hierarchy — especially during adolescence, when teenagers feign more knowledge than they actually possess.
So while Paulina exerts control over the other girls by weaponizing their insecurities about their looks, family backgrounds, and status — a particular target of her bullying is bashful Nana, who struggles with her weight — Paulina also inspires their awe by boasting of her supposed knowledge of American fashion, cuisine, and pop culture. However, in a further demonstration of Bioh's savvy about the social dynamics of high school, there are signs of latent rebellion by the girls early on, and Paulina's mystique crumbles utterly when Ericka captures the excited attention of the recruiter for the Miss Ghana pageant, played by Kris Sidberry.
It's a welcome return to a Boston stage for Sidberry, whose last local performance was in SpeakEasy's 2016 production of “Significant Other," and who endows the recruiter in “School Girls" with just the right combination of glamour, ambition, and self-absorption. Also a decided asset is Crystin Gilmore, who played the sensual Shug Avery in SpeakEasy's 2014 production of “The Color Purple." In “School Girls," portraying the school's headmistress, Gilmore nicely balances steeliness and compassion.
Compassion abounds in this play as well, and it very much extends to Paulina as well as the rest of the girls. We come to care about all of them. And by the end of “School Girls," after they've learned the unjust ways of the world, they all seem a little older.
S CHOOL GIRLS; OR, THE AFRICAN MEAN GIRLS PLAY
Play by Jocelyn Bioh. Directed by Summer L. Williams. Presented by SpeakEasy Stage Company. At Roberts Studio Theatre, Calderwood Pavilion, Boston Center for the Arts, through May 25. Tickets from $25, 617-933-8600, www.speakeasystage.com

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The special counsel's office sought to keep secret the memos written by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, in an attempt to stop those under investigation -- like President Trump -- from tailoring their stories to line up with Mr. Comey's accounts, according to a court transcript made public Tuesday.
Lawyers for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, made their arguments in a closed-door hearing in January 2018 before a federal judge, who was overseeing a lawsuit to have memos Mr. Comey wrote about his interactions with the president released to the public. News organizations had sued the Justice Department over access to the memos, but the case became moot when Congress made them public three months later. The judge ordered a transcript of the hearing released on Tuesday.
The transcript provides a window into the status of the special counsel's investigation eight months after Mr. Mueller began examining whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, among other issues. At the hearing, one of Mr. Mueller's top lawyers, Michael Dreeben, tried to illustrate the severity of the investigation, the questions over the president's conduct and the potential benefits for witnesses who had read Mr. Comey's memos.
"An individual who is seeking to shape or mold his own statements around those of others thereby acquires an advantage in doing so that he would not otherwise have," Mr. Dreeben said, according to the transcript.
Mr. Dreeben acknowledged to the judge, James E. Boasberg of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, that Mr. Trump was being investigated for obstructing justice and that the F.B.I. had opened that inquiry before Mr. Mueller's appointment in May 2017.
"That investigation entailed matters that were covered in the Comey memoranda, which explored and recorded Mr. Comey's recollections of meetings, including one-on-one meetings with the president of the United States," Mr. Dreeben said, referring to the initial F.B.I. inquiry. "In those meetings, events occurred that led the F.B.I. to conclude that an investigation was appropriate under its authority to consider matters such as obstruction of justice."
Mr. Dreeben added, "In this instance, a person whose conduct is within the scope of the investigation is the president of the United States."
Details of the transcript were first reported Tuesday by CNN.
Many details from Mr. Comey's memos had already been made public at the time of the hearing. The New York Times reported in May 2017 that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey for his loyalty and for an end to the investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The day after The Times reported on the Flynn encounter, Mr. Mueller was appointed.
The next month, Mr. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his interactions with the president. Mr. Dreeben said that although many parts of the memos had been previously revealed, it was still important to keep them away from those whose conduct was being scrutinized.
"Those memoranda are also far more detailed in many instances than the matters that Mr. Comey revealed either in his statement for the record or in his oral testimony before the Senate," Mr. Dreeben said.
He said that because Mr. Comey's memos were written contemporaneously, witnesses would want their accounts to line up with the memos.
During an investigation, evidence like Mr. Comey's memos "are typically held in confidence through the course of the investigation and any ensuing proceedings to ensure that all witnesses provide truthful evidence based on their own recollections and not on any inadvertent or advertent tailoring or influence from other witness statements."
Mr. Mueller's office ultimately lost the battle -- but not in the courtroom. In April 2018, the Justice Department provided copies to members of Congress, which immediately released them to the public.
A year after the memos became public, Mr. Mueller finished his investigation and declined to decide whether the president obstructed justice. The attorney general, William P. Barr, cleared the president of wrongdoing. But in his report, Mr. Mueller detailed more than a dozen episodes that legal experts believe show how Mr. Trump sought to interfere with the investigation. Among them were several of the encounters Mr. Comey detailed in his memos.

Texto completo: To tell the truth, Gabby Douglas is competitive about most everything.
Whether that means going for gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games or participating in TV game shows such as "$100,000 Pyramid" and "To Tell The Truth."
"I'm excited and also nervous," Douglas said Thursday about her game show appearances as a celebrity panelist. "I want to do my best. I am super competitive. I don't want to lose."
Douglas' wins have made her a legend in U.S. gymnastics history. At 16, she became the first African American woman to capture an Olympic gold medal in the all-around individual event.
One of the "Fierce Five" at the London Olympiad in 2012, she also collected gold in the team event. Douglas became the first American to earn gold in those two events at the same Olympics.
She wasn't done. Douglas became the first American with an all-around gold medal to return to a second Olympics, making the U.S. team nicknamed the "Final Five" at the Rio Games in 2016. They won the team title for a third gold to add to Douglas' treasure trove of Olympic and world championships medals.
Douglas, now 23, will share her story and outlook as the keynote speaker at the Savannah Morning News/savannahnow.com Best of Prep banquet, presented by
the Georgia Ports Authority. The ninth annual event honoring area high school athletes and coaches is May 14 from 6-9 p.m. at the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort & Spa on Hutchinson Island.
Douglas has done a lot of public speaking, and enjoys it, but that doesn't mean she's totally relaxed.
"I still get nervous," she said. "That's with anything. I want to do my best. I have a lot of fun speaking to students, (and) people my age. "I will definitely speak to them about working hard, about perseverance and commitment, and also about thinking for yourself. I think a lot of times,
especially in this generation, you start to follow the crowd. ... If we start to follow the crowd, we miss out on what we were given."
Those comments are especially apt to Douglas' story. A state champion gymnast in her native Virginia and promising national competitor, Douglas realized by age 12, she said, that if she wants to be an Olympian, she would have to move away from home to get the best coaching and training.
Such strong conviction from this pre-teen wasn't going to be ignored. She talked to her mother, Natalie Hawkins.
"It took a little bit to get there, but she was so resolute," Hawkins recalled during the same telephone interview Thursday with Douglas, who is based in Southern California. "She said, 'I'm going to get there or I'll quit. I know what I need.' "
Hawkins had at times told Douglas, who has two sisters and one brother, to tough it out when she had issues with her gymnastics coaches in Virginia. But this was a life-changing decision.
"She was always very aware of what she wanted and how she wanted to go after it," Hawkins said. "It was things I couldn't dispute as an adult."
History proved Douglas correct. At 14, she moved to Wes Des Moines, Iowa, to train under famed coach Liang Chow and live with a host family.
New heights
At a young 16 (she was born on New Year's Eve 1995), Douglas was headed to the London Games and gracing the covers of Sports Illustrated and Time magazines and a Wheaties cereal box. The two-gold performance in one of the Summer Games' most popular sports launched Douglas' celebrity status, leading to endorsements, the first of two New York Times bestselling books ("Raising the Bar"), and making the list of Barbara Walters' "10 Most Fascinating People of 2012" - all before her 17th birthday.
Oh, and she was The Associated Press' Female Athlete of the Year for 2012.
The whirlwind of new opportunities came fast but were years in the making. Douglas sacrificed time with family and the normal life of a teenager to work daily at a physically and mentally demanding sport with a limited window for success.
"I was always in the gym. The gym was my first home, and home was my second home," Douglas said. "It's literally a different world. You're in your own zone, your own bubble."
So much so that years later, people will discuss an event from news or pop culture that Douglas won't know about. On the other hand, she has been able to meet and know highly successful people and experience fantastic things outside that bubble, like having a Barbie Doll created in her image as an inspiration to young girls.
"A lot of things I've done I never thought I'd be doing them," said Douglas, whose Barbie "Shero" Doll was announced after she made the U.S. team in July 2016.
"It still hasn't sunk in. It's really amazing. The whole process is super fun. I was involved in the process, deciding on her hair and clothes. It's a super honor to be compared with all these amazing women" also portrayed as Barbie Dolls.
Douglas, who also was the subject of a movie on the Lifetime Network and a reality show on Oxygen, has become an entrepreneur with her line of products for lips (Beauty Bakerie) and hair (RPG), and wants to get into skin care.
"Medals and accolades are great, but they don't define you as a person, they don't dictate who you are as a human being," Douglas said, adding this advice: "Don't add that extra pressure and stress. Enjoy what you do. It will take you far."
She will continue to speak to young people, as she embraces being a role model.
"For sure," she said.
"It comes with a huge responsibility. I'm still learning and growing as a person."

A star diplomat's fatal flaw? Being unlikeable

Texto completo: OUR MAN:
Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century
By George Packer
Knopf, 592 pp., illustrated, $30
It seems unpromising: a massive, sprawling biography of Richard Holbrooke, whose name you may dimly remember from the Bill Clinton years and his late-life efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A diplomat, you may vaguely recall. Big fellow, big ego. (Both indisputable.) Something about the Balkans. (And the peace he crafted in the unlikely environs of Dayton, Ohio.) Yesterday's man. (With the fading interest of yesterday.)
But by the end of the second page, maybe the third, you will be hooked. You'll come to understand that the author, New Yorker writer George Packer, understood Holbrooke, understood power, understood America in its eclipse at the end of the 20th century and into the 21st. You'll come to understand that Packer knew the great man, in fact thought he was great: great of ambition, of character, of intelligence, of intuition, of impulse, and, above all, great of flaws, including betrayal. And you'll realize that Holbrooke, who died nine years ago, was central to what was central to much of postwar American life, and that in a terrifying way his story is America's story.
There never was a diplomat-activist quite like him, and there seldom has been a book quite like this — sweeping and sentimental, beguiling and brutal, catty and critical, much like the man himself. Packer interviewed 250 people who knew Holbrooke — he was at the center of a vast Venn diagram of thinkers, lawmakers, diplomats, world leaders, rogues, and charlatans. And journalist Kati Marton, his last wife, though not his last lover, gave Packer access to a trove of documents, diaries, billets-doux. She imagined Packer would use them brilliantly, and he did, but she can't have imagined the undercurrent of poignancy that runs throughout.
The driven Holbrooke achieved much, but his tragedy was that he never reached the commanding heights of American public life, never realized his dream of being secretary of state, and always was the reluctant, resistant, even rebellious hostage of some patron or other. Surely he must have contemplated Samuel Johnson's definition of a patron as “a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery."
For this book is Holbrooke's life unexpurgated, and unsparing. Here is laid out his treachery toward friends. The shabby way he treated his first wife. The impertinent way he talked to president-elect Jimmy Carter. The way he cheated with his best friend's wife. The contempt in which he was held by Barack Obama and, by the end, almost everyone in power, except Hillary Rodham Clinton (who, like John Kerry, would've likely lifted Holbrooke up, had either moved into the Oval Office). Most of all, this book screams a lesson about the perils of substituting ambition for the true distilled idealism of youth. It is a treatise of loyalties abandoned, chances squandered, promise wasted.
But it is also a story of luck. As a young man he ensconced himself in the family of his friend David Rusk, son of Dean Rusk, Kennedy's secretary of state. He wangled himself an internship with The New York Times. There he came under the thrall of Gay Talese. He entered the Foreign Service. His first assignment, in the pungent year 1963, was a backwater called Vietnam. There he fell in with David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan, the signature reporters of that early stage of the American war. He played tennis with General (and later ambassador) Maxwell Taylor. That was his entree to Taylor's close friend, Robert F. Kennedy.
That sort of thing happened to him repeatedly. He was an opportunist, to be sure, and often an obnoxious one. Packer sketches this life with authority and perception and, it must be said, with panoramic beauty. And with some sympathy and admiration. “He was exceptional from the start," he writes, “not just because he was brilliant and curious and widely read, but because he was unafraid to face the truth, cared enough to act on it, and was willing to take the consequences."
Holbrooke, however, is not the sole focus of Packer's mastery. He also brings to vivid life the age and the men, for they are mainly men, who ran the country (and thus much of the world). Early on, for example, Packer takes on a Massachusetts mastodon, barely settled in his Saigon embassy: Henry Cabot Lodge — “who had been in the country less than a week and admitted that he barely knew Vietnam at all . . . [suggested] over lunch at the ambassador's residence that the primitive superstitions of the Vietnamese people made them hard to understand and their politics unworthy of serious respect, a plaything compared to the high level of American politics."
So what was Holbrooke's appeal? That he was a curious mix of the intelligent and the indefatigable. That he was a master of the political arts — one of which was persuasion — and also of simply, in the vernacular, sucking up. It did not hurt that he was what Packer called “polychromatic company." People liked to have lunch with him, which is a favored, valued skill in Washington. Sadly for him (despite all the sound advice he offered on Afghanistan that fell on ears made deaf by his pummeling insistence) people simply didn't like him. It turns out that matters.

With anti-Semitism on the rise, Jews must call out hatred on the left and the right

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Suns don't offer Williams job, take patient course

Texto completo: The Phoenix Suns appear to have done everything but make Monty Williams an offer.
The Suns met with Williams for a second interview Wednesday in Philadelphia with team owner Robert Sarver present, but they did not make him an offer, according to NBA sources.
However, the New York Times' Marc Stein has reported the job is there for the taking if Williams "wants it."
The Los Angeles Lakers are also in the running for Williams, but like Phoenix, didn't make him an offer after their second interview, the Los Angeles Times reported last week.
The Suns are being patient and thorough in their coaching search, as league sources have confirmed to The Republic, and they are looking at other candidates. They've met with Williams and Portland Trail Blazers assistants David Vanterpool and Nate Tibbetts and they don't plan on stopping there.
The Lakers and Suns waiting for the other to offer so they can counter with a better offer or they're not making one right now out of respect to Williams being in the middle of a playoff run with the 76ers.
Philadelphia will host Toronto in Game 3 of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifnals on Thursday with the series tied at 1-1. Game 4 is Sunday in Philadelphia.
A key component from the Suns' perspective is Sarver.
While this will be General Manager James Jones' decision, Sarver's history with coaches would make the next one curious as to why they've had four coaches in four seasons.
So that vibe between the next coach and Sarver is important, but having a strong connection with Jones is arguably more important, because he is making the basketball decisions.
Jones is looking to reshape a the Suns' young roster through the draft and with the possible addition of veterans through free agency or trades.
He's the one who is overseeing this shift in training and conditioning.
Longtime trainer Aaron Nelson is headed to New Orleans to work for the Pelicans, but the Suns are moving forward with Steward, a world-class healthcare provider, as well as EXOS, a human performance company, on the team's medical and performance efforts as part of an evaluation of its basketball operations.
Still, stability is something Williams must ponder when it comes to the Suns job.
Phoenix can't afford to fire this new hire after a year or two. That'll not only make it more difficult to find another coach, but also to establish and build a team identity and philosophy so that the current players can grow, develop and improve in it.
Plus, what quality free agent would want to come to a franchise that's had five coaches in five seasons?
The Suns have a talented, young core led by Devin Booker and 7-footer Deandre Ayton, but players value franchise structure, too.
As for the Lakers, they're not exactly the model franchise to join right now, either.
Yes, they have LeBron James, the greatest player of his generation, but Magic Johnson, the greatest Laker ever, abruptly exited from his position as president of basketball operations at the end of this past season.
The man who led the Lakers to five NBA titles as a player and been a major fixture in the franchise for decades just up and quits? That's not a good look.
The Lakers have a young roster that could use some reconstruction, too.
Phoenix hasn't had a winning record since 2013-14 and hasn't been to the playoffs since 2010, but Los Angeles is on a similar drought.
Philadelphia 76ers assistant Monty Williams may be the hottest head coaching candidate this summer.

HBO film on Nassar scandal tells hard truths

Texto completo: "How much is a little girl worth?" asked former gymnast Rachael Denhollander during the victim impact statements at Larry Nassar's sentencing hearing — seven days of raw, devastating, ultimately empowering testimony from more than 150 women who faced their abuser for the world to see.
That moment captures the message of "At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal," airing on HBO at 8 p.m. Friday. The documentary delves into a system that failed to protect young athletes from sexual abuse by a predator who used his medical credentials as a cover for his crimes.
Filmmaker Erin Lee Carr started working on the movie in July 2017, about six months before Nassar, a former Michigan State University doctor and USA Gymnastics team physician, was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison. She was still poring over the finishing touches days before its Thursday debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.
As the Tribeca guide describes, " 'At the Heart of Gold' follows the money and it leads to the abuse of the bodies of young girls deemed disposable. But the films also highlights their efforts to fight back and earn the most important title of their lives: survivor."
Carr's first goal for her documentary is to give a voice to those survivors. Beyond that, her sharp eye keeps the spotlight on what allowed accusations against Nassar to go unheeded for so long and how to safeguard against future abusers.
"My hope is for this film to add to the incredible reporting that has been done about this subject matter, and then to really serve as a flint, to emit more fire. I think there's a lot of accountability that needs to happen," says Carr. "This doesn't have to happen again."
"At The Heart of Gold" tells its story through interviews with a dozen survivors, along with lawyers, coaches, commentators, sportswriters and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who presided over the Nassar trial.
The film doesn't flinch from showing the horrifying extent of Nassar's sexual abuse — which took place over decades — and his grooming techniques of pretending to be an empathetic ally to his targets. But the documentary also illuminates the dark side of U.S. women's gymnastics, a place where tweens and teens were pushed so hard to see who could succeed, it became what one interviewee calls "athletic Darwinism."
From the time they are small girls, these elite athletes are required to have incredible physical skill, withstand pain and injury without complaining and to tolerate the constant, often bullying commands of adults.
"It's almost like being a wounded animal. You don't show your weakness," says Kathy Johnson, a pioneering U.S. gymnast and sports commentator, early in the film.
Carr, a former producer at Vice and a 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree, has made a name for herself with several high-profile documentaries for HBO, including 2017's "Mommy Dead and Dearest," which explored Munchhausen syndrome by proxy and murder in the mother-and-daughter saga of Dee Dee and Gypsy Blanchard.
Her upcoming film, "I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth vs. Michelle Carter," which will air sometime this summer and was screened in March at the SXSW festival, involves the trial of a teenager who via text urged her friend to kill himself.
Carr also is the author of "All That You Leave Behind," a just-released memoir about her life with her late father, acclaimed New York Times media reporter David Carr.
As she was wrapping up an episode for "Dirty Money," a Netflix series on financial misdeeds, Carr was approached about making a documentary on the Nassar scandal. That started the painstaking process of researching the subject and trying to to gain the trust of survivors.
"It was, I would say, very difficult. At the start, nobody said yes to us," she admits. "People were very careful. There was some trepidation."
Eventually, Michigan attorney Mick Grewel, who is in the movie and represents several survivors, helped open the door to initial conversations with his clients. The 12 interviews from women who endured Nassar's appalling physical violations give the movie an emotional resonance that, three years after the Indianapolis Star's landmark investigation, feels as powerful as ever.
The pain that remains with the survivors provoked Carr to briefly speak up during an interview with Trinea Gonczar and offer her words of comfort from off-screen. Carr considered cutting out her comments.
"There was part of me that has been trained as a journalist by my dad David Carr, who worked at the Times, that it's about getting information and not putting yourself in the story. But I felt like that was an impossibility given the subject matter, and so I allowed myself to participate in what I think is sort of radical empathy," she says.
"In that moment, I'm showing the audience that I am listening, I am attentive, but I also understand. And it's not something she needs to be embarrassed about or ashamed about. That to me was a really important part."
Later, at the sentencing hearing, Gonczar is shown telling Nassar to his face, "You hurt me, as I've had to realize I was abused for many years of my life. ...I will do everything for the rest of my life to make sure that the 'yous' of this world don't get to hurt another one of us."
Carr was determined not to "give the movie over to Larry Nassar," as she puts it, even though he appears in videos and photos from before and during his trial. "He had taken so much power away from so many people that it was really like, 'OK how do I tell this story without handing the movie over to the perpetrator, because that would cause more harm, and I'm not in the business of causing more harm."
In fact, she carefully weighed the decision to include clips from what appears to be an instructional tape with Nassar and a young girl whose face is blurred out. Educational on the surface but chilling in retrospect, it shows Nassar putting his hands on her body over and over as he demonstrates certain movements and injuries.
"What I saw as a filmmaker was the general ease in which he touched women's bodies. He never asked," says Carr. "It was potentially a risky choice to include those videos, but it really went to the heart of his behavior. ... He saw these women as just objects. It really deeply disturbed me."
Carr wasn't able to be in court for the January 2018 statements from survivors. Hospitalized with a rare form of pneumonia, she relied on executive producer Sarah Gibson to be there for the bulk of the time. When Gibson returned with the footage, Carr recalls, "I think I said, 'We have a documentary now.' "
The tentacles of the USA Gymnastics scandal had an enormous reach, as "At the Heart of Gold" chronicles in detail. Nassar, currently in prison, was sentenced to up to 175 years behind bars. Not long after, the entire board of USA Gymnastics resigned and the organization lost its certification. The chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee stepped down from his post. Michigan State University agreed to a $500 million settlement for those he had abused.
Now it's time for the ripple effects of efforts like Carr's film to shift attention to preventing sexual abuse and helping move women's gymnastics — and all sports that draw children, tweens and teens into rigorous training regimens — in a better direction.
"I want the survivors to feel represented, and I want young people, young men and women, to feel like they can speak up if something happens to them," says Carr. "If those things happen, even on a small scale, I will be deeply thrilled that I did a small act of service in this really beautiful and devastating world."

Texto completo: Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., announced he will run in the Democratic primary to seek his party’s nomination to go up against President Trump in the 2020 election.
“My plan is to run for president. I appreciate you letting me come here to announce that,” Bennet said in an interview with “CBS This Morning” on Thursday. “I think this country faces two enormous challenges, among others. One is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans, and the other is we need to restore integrity to our government. I think we need to do both of those things.”
Tweet
Bennet signaled last month that he would launch a presidential campaign if he defeated prostate cancer. After going through surgery, a spokesperson said in late April the procedure was “completely successful and he requires no further treatment.”
Bennet's brother, James Bennet, is an editorial page editor for the New York Times. As a result, the Times issued a statement Thursday that James Bennet "has recused himself from any work generated by the opinion desk related to the 2020 presidential election."
"He will not discuss, assign or edit any editorials, Op-Eds, columns or other Opinion pieces focused on candidates or major issues in the campaign," the statement said.
More than 20 candidates are running in the Democratic primary. They include figures such as former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Texto completo: JERUSALEM - Israel ushered in its Holocaust Remembrance Day on Wednesday in memory of the 6 million Jews killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators in World War II, as leaders voiced concerns about a rising tide of anti-Semitism worldwide.
In moving speeches to hundreds of Israeli politicians and Holocaust survivors at the country's national Holocaust memorial, Israel's ceremonial president warned the government against warming up to far-right parties in Europe, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed to last weekend's deadly synagogue shooting in San Diego as evidence of growing anti-Semitic hatred.
The 24-hour remembrance period began at sundown with the main ceremony at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, held just hours after Israeli researchers reported that violent attacks against Jews rose significantly last year. This spike, highlighted by the San Diego attack, was most dramatic in western Europe.
President Reuven Rivlin touched on the surging anti-Semitism in Europe, which he said "is once again rearing its head, fueled by waves of immigration, economic crises and disillusionment with the political establishment.
In veiled criticism of Netanyahu, he urged the government to rethink its cultivation of alliances with nationalist parties in Europe.
"Not every right-wing party in Europe that believes in controlling immigration or in protecting its unique character is anti-Semitic or xenophobic, Rivlin said. "But political forces where anti-Semitism and racism are part of their language, their legacy or their ideology can never be our allies.
He added: "No interest and no consideration of realpolitik can justify a dishonorable alliance with racist groups or elements who do not acknowledge their past and their responsibility for the crimes of the Holocaust.
Rivlin did not identify any particular countries. But Netanyahu has come under fire for embracing a string of eastern European leaders who have lavished Israel with political support while promoting a distorted image of the Holocaust and stoking anti-Semitism at home.
A slew of former communist nations whose leaders recently paid their respects at Yad Vashem, such as Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, are swept up in a wave of World War II-era revisionism that seeks to diminish their culpability in the Holocaust while making heroes out of anti-Soviet nationalists involved in the mass killing of Jews. Many in Israel have accused Netanyahu of cynically betraying victims' memories for political gain.
In his remarks, Netanyahu also stressed the continued threat of anti-Semitic extremism. He said that the extreme right, extreme left and radical Islam agree on "one thing: their hatred of Jews.
Netanyahu noted the deadly synagogue shootings in San Diego last weekend and Pittsburgh last October, as well as recurring vandalism at Jewish cemeteries. He also castigated a recent political cartoon in the New York Times' international edition that drew ire for playing on anti-Semitic tropes, saying that hatred of Jews has even worked its way into "respected newspapers and mainstream views.
"We're not talking about legitimate criticism of Israel, he said, "but of systematic, poisonous and shallow hatred.
In an emotional ritual, six survivors lit torches in memory of the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. The torchlighters' brutal trials in concentration camps and narratives of endurance reflected this year's theme at Yad Vashem, "The War Within the War: the Struggle of the Jews to Survive During the Holocaust.
This year's theme urges the public to keep alive memories of extraordinary Jewish courage and resilience during World War II - those who risked their lives in acts of solidarity for fellow Jews, smuggled food, organized rescue missions, published underground newspapers, played Jewish music on contraband instruments and documented their suffering for posterity.
The Holocaust, in which a third of the world's Jews were murdered, runs deep in Israeli public consciousness. The state, engendered in the wake of the genocide in 1948 as a place of refuge for Jews across the world, is filled with Holocaust survivors and their descendants.
Wednesday's event initiated one of the most melancholy holidays on the country's calendar, observed with numerous vigils, ceremonies and gatherings.
Places of entertainment and shops shutter for the evening. TV and radio stations broadcast Holocaust documentaries and interviews with survivors until sundown the next day. The names of those who perished in the genocide are read aloud in parliament.
According to the Hebrew calendar, Holocaust Remembrance Day marks the anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising - the most significant, yet doomed, act of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust that helped shape Israel's national psyche, symbolizing strength and the struggle for freedom in the face of annihilation.
On Thursday, Israel's Holocaust remembrance will stop traffic. Israelis come to a two-minute standstill to remember the dead as sirens wails across the country. Pedestrians freeze in their tracks, buses halt on busy streets and cars pull over on highways to honor the legacies of those lost.

Texto completo: As a passionate supporter of President Donald Trump and his administration, I've just about had it with the fact-obsessed liberal elite truth-huggers out there not believing everything the president and his people say.
The latest complaint from radical left-wingers is that Attorney General William Barr lied to Congress when he testified April 9 about his four-page memo summarizing the 448-page Mueller (Witch Hunt!) report.
The assertion that Barr lied is based on a predictably flimsy detail: a specific example showing that Barr clearly lied. I mean, c'mon! Is that the best they can do?
The Washington Post and The New York Times (FAKE NEWS!) reported Tuesday night that special counsel Robert Mueller sent a letter to Barr in late March complaining that Barr's four-page memo -- which gloriously cleared Trump of all wrongdoing -- "did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions."
The letter continued: "There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations."
Whatever. #MAGA!
On April 9, Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist said to Barr: "Reports have emerged recently ... that members of the special counsel's team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th (memo). ... Do you know what they are referencing with that?"
And Barr responded: "No, I don't."
Only a deranged liberal would conclude that Barr getting a letter from Mueller in March complaining about limited information in the four-page memo and Barr saying, "No, I don't" in April when asked whether he knew there were Mueller team complaints about limited information in that memo constitutes a lie.
For starters, which comes first, March or April? I have no idea. How can we establish that conclusively? If Congress tried to subpoena a calendar, I'm confident the Trump administration would do the right thing and ignore the subpoena while calling calendars a "Gregorian hoax," because that's what you do when you're super innocent.
Barr testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and further clarified the idiot liberal confusion over his April testimony, noting that he "talked directly to Bob Mueller -- not members of his team." Crist's question in April asked if Barr knew "members of the special counsel's team" were frustrated. You see? Mueller wasn't part of Mueller's team -- for proof, read the classic team-building textbook "If You Run the Team, You Aren't on the Team" -- so Barr's previous response was not a lie. HUM A FEW BARS OF THAT ONE, HIPPIES!
Furthermore, if the nation's top law enforcement official did engage in strategic truth evasion, that's not called "lying" under the Trump administration. It's called "being on-brand."
Everyone knows Trump is the best president ever AND a branding mastermind. Since becoming president, he has been all-in on dishonesty, boldly proving to the libs that you can lie constantly and still be the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.
The Washington Post's fact checker recently celebrated Trump's branding feat with news that on April 26, the president hit a remarkable milestone: 10,000 false or misleading claims told since he took office. HE DID IT!! MAGA for life!
So any suggestions that Barr lied to Congress -- which is technically a "crime," if you believe in such liberal concepts -- is utter nonsense. Barr was just managing the presidential brand, which is the attorney general's sworn duty, according to this copy of the Constitution that I'm not going to show you even if you subpoena it.
Why wouldn't I show you a genuine copy of a document that would prove I'm telling the truth? Simple: I don't want to.
It's just like Trump's refusal to turn over his tax returns, which without question would prove 100 percent that he's just as rich as he says he is, donates generously to charities and has no foreign investments or businesses interests that would influence how he governs the country. Releasing his tax returns would be a huge waste of time because the president has already said there's nothing bad in them. Who are you going to trust, a brilliant president who has successfully lied more than any president in history or a bunch of stupid numbers on paper?
Duh. You trust the man who broke the 10,000-false-and-misleading-claims mark in record time without any of his supporters caring. He's never going to deceive you, as long as you never stop believing everything he says is true.
It's the same with Barr.
Mueller might say the attorney general "did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions." Others who've read all of the redacted Mueller report might say Barr's claim that the report exonerates Trump is willfully misleading, legally laughable and an example of a bespectacled toady doing the bidding of a corrupt megalomaniac who wouldn't know honesty if an adult film star spanked him on the butt with it.
And some loser Democrats might go so far as to say Barr lied.
But he didn't. He was just being marvelously, perfectly, Trumptastically on-brand.

Texto completo: A comedy about the end of a romance is streaming on Netflix. And "Aliens" is on IFC.
What's Streaming
SOMEONE GREAT (2019) Stream on Netflix. Gina Rodriguez, Brittany Snow, DeWanda Wise and Lakeith Stanfield star in this comedy. Rodriguez plays Jenny, who lands a job that calls for her to move from New York to the West Coast. Then her longtime partner, Nate (Stanfield), ends their relationship. A night out with friends (Snow and Wise) is called for, both from the characters' perspectives (Jenny's friends want to provide balm for her breakup) and from the film's creators' (in her review for The New York Times, Karen Han referred to this movie as "Netflix's contribution to the 'girls' night out' genre.")
BOYZ N THE HOOD (1991) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. After the director John Singleton died on Monday, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times that Singleton's "Boyz N the Hood," a coming-of-age story set in what was then called South Central Los Angeles, "rests in American movie history like a boulder in a riverbed, altering the direction of the stream." The film was Singleton's directorial debut; it earned him an Academy Award nomination for best director, making him both the youngest person and first African-American to receive that nomination. The film focuses on a group of teenagers in the early '90s, including the smart mall worker Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), the scholarship-seeking high school football star Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and Doughboy (Ice Cube), their troubled friend and Ricky's half brother. In his article this week, Scott wrote that Singleton synthesized several precursors -- "Mean Streets," "Rebel Without a Cause," Blaxploitation movies, 1930s crime genres, westerns and samurai epics -- and "came up with something bracingly, thrillingly and frighteningly new."
PATERSON (2016) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Adam Driver received his first Tony Award nomination this week for his performance as Pale, the eruptive, coked-up restaurant manager in "Burn This" on Broadway. That man couldn't be more different from the one he plays in this slow-burner from Jim Jarmusch -- save for the fact that both characters are from New Jersey. Driver here plays Paterson, a soft-spoken bus driver who shares his name with the town he lives in, Paterson, N.J., and who in his free time sits by the water writing poetry. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie a "wonderful new dispatch from Jarmusch-land."
What's on TV
ALIENS (1986) 6 p.m. on IFC. In March, the drama club of North Bergen High School in New Jersey caused an online stir when it posted a trailer for "Alien: The Play," a home-brewed stage adaptation of the 1979 science-fiction thriller. Another stir happened last week, when Sigourney Weaver, a star of the original, visited the high school during an encore performance of the play. The rest of us may have to settle for the original movies, like this James Cameron-directed sequel, which again pits Weaver's Ellen Ripley against the series's famous, long-headed xenomorph.

Texto completo: Apple responded to a recent New York Times report that it removed or restricted 11 of the 17 most downloaded parental control and screen-time apps and clamped down on others for what the company claims was a simple reason: “they put users’ privacy and security at risk. ”
But rivals contend it was done for competitive purposes, since Apple launched its own Screen Time tools in September 2018, as part of iOS 12.
Now one of the companies whose app was removed, OurPact, is responding to Apple’s response. In a post on Medium, titled “There Used To Be An App For That,” OurPact claims Apple’s statement is misleading.
The issue surrounds what is known as Mobile Device Management technology, which Apple in its statement describes as “highly invasive” because it gives a third party “control and access over a device and its most sensitive information, including user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions, and browsing history. ”
While Apple added that MDM has some legitimate uses, it also said the tech is extremely risky and can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes.
Kid ride-sharers: Parents, would you let your kid ride an Uber or Lyft by themselves?
Samsung Galaxy S10 5G burned: A Samsung smartphone reportedly burned. The company blames 'external impact'
OurPact countered that, “This stands in contradiction to the fact that MDM technology was initially developed by Apple to ensure security of private data on remotely managed devices. ”
OurPact points to Apple’s own documentation, which states that MDM cannot see such personal data as emails, calendars, iMessages, device location, frequency of app use and more.
“To clarify this very important point,” the company wrote, “OurPact does not have access to any of this private information via MDM. It is impossible for us, hackers, or anybody else to obtain it. Apple is the only one who has access to and uses this data. ”
OurPact went on to say that the sensitive information its own app collects – which includes a child’s name, age, gender, installed apps, and location – is the data it deems “absolutely necessary to provide our service,” and is only retained for “as short a period as possible. ”
The company says it complies with all global data protection laws, including the stringent regulations that are in place in Europe.
What’s more, OurPact says its app had been approved by Apple 37 times, with documented use of MDM from its inception in 2015, until being suddenly removed in October of last year, with very little communication from Apple.
Even at that, in the post, OurPact expresses great respect for Apple and its stance on privacy.
“By choice, we would never be in the unfortunate position of telling one of the most beloved companies in the world that they have made a mistake, but sometimes the truth has to be spoken to power. . . . Given that there are no privacy issues with properly vetted MDM apps like OurPact being on the App Store, we humbly request that we are reinstated and allowed to continue providing our million users with the service they love and depend on. ”
USA TODAY has reached out to Apple and is awaiting a comment on the OurPact response.

Finding Lonzo Ball's missing $1.5M - and himself

Texto completo: When Humble Lukanga was studying finance at the University of New Mexico, he read about the large number of pro athletes who went broke in retirement. Lukanga knew, on the surface, that he had little in common with linebackers and power forwards. He had spent his early childhood in Uganda, merely trying to survive.
But he felt that he could relate to many of them on one important level. "I couldn't imagine escaping poverty and then going back," he said in an interview, one of only a few the normally circumspect Lukanga has given. "So I became almost obsessed with this epidemic that nobody was caring about."
It was an obsession that recently helped him rescue Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers from potential ruin. In the process, Lukanga, a financial adviser with a growing reputation in Hollywood as a behind-the-scenes power broker and sage, found himself in an unfamiliar role: whistleblower.
Last fall, Lukanga was doing Ball's accounting when he discovered that about $1.5 million was missing from Ball's personal and business accounts. Lukanga alerted Ball, who has since sued Alan Foster, a business partner and family friend, for more than $2 million in damages as part of a lawsuit that alleges that Foster embezzled money from Ball and Big Bailer Brand, the sneaker company that Ball co-founded.
On Wednesday, The Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI was investigating the matter. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment.
Lukanga and Ball declined to discuss specifics of the case, citing continuing legal proceedings. But Ball, 21, who has spent much of his life in the shadow of his father, LaVar, appears to be shifting some of his priorities by hiring a new agent and by putting Lukanga at the center of his business affairs.
"Without Humble, I don't know where I'd be right now," Ball said in a telephone interview. "I'd be in a very, very bad situation."
He added: "We'll have a two-hour meeting set up, and I'll end up talking to him for eight hours. There's nothing fake coming from him, which is hard to find these days."
Lukanga now works with about 40 clients in sports and entertainment, including NFL players DeAndre Hopkins and Darius Slay and actor Issa Rae, and manages more than $120 million in assets, according to recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With his boyish smile, he looks as if he could pass as a teenager. But he considers himself older than his actual age, 33, or at least wiser.
"Those are Ugandan years," he said recently in his office in Beverly Hills.
He described his childhood as "challenging." At one time, he said,, his father, Erisa, was a prominent man who had helped oversee Uganda's coffee trade. But all Lukanga knew as a young boy was struggle, he said, as the country grappled with regime change and its malignant effects. Some family members were murdered, he said. Others died of illness. His parents lived in fear.
Lukanga recalled the day he was informed that his family had secured political asylum in the United States. Lukanga was 11, and a close family friend relayed the news - along with a warning to keep it quiet. The family would leave Uganda that night.
For a young boy from a small village, with the effects of genocide and famine all around him, Lukanga knew it was a miracle, he said. But he was also terrible at keeping secrets, so he ran outside to tell his friends.
"We're going to America!" he shouted.
Despite his lack of discretion, his family soon settled in a small apartment in Denver. His parents described political asylum as winning the "freedom lottery," he said - not that their new life was easy. Lukanga's mother, Sanyu, worked as a maid, and his father cleaned chain restaurants at night.
At the same time, Humble Lukanga recalled being introduced to the magic of school books (which he could take home with him) and school lunches (which were provided for children who could not afford them) and school buses (which may have been the most amazing discovery of all).
Lukanga was in high school, he said, when his mother had a stroke that left her paralyzed. His father would care for her during the day and work longer hours at night to make ends meet. Lukanga would help.
Armed with cleaning supplies and dodging his father's employers, Lukanga recalled one thought that stuck with him: The curse of poverty ends with me.
On school nights, Lukanga would try to grab about four hours' sleep. He found solace in the classroom. Michelle Von Tilius, one of his teachers at Overland High School, outside Denver, recalled Lukanga as uniquely driven. Lukanga used to tell her that he wanted to start his own record label.
"A lot of kids say stuff like that, and you hope for the best," Tilius said. "But part of you is like, 'Is this really going to happen?'"
Sure enough, as a student at New Mexico, Lukanga began selling self-produced CDs and T-shirts out of his trunk. "I still have one," Tilius said.
Lukanga was fending for himself. While he was in college, he said, his mother died, and then his father had a fatal heart attack while traveling home to Uganda to bury her.
"Everything has been stacked against him," Arian Foster, the former NFL running back, said in a telephone interview. "And he continues to persevere."
After he earne his MBA from New Mexico, Lukanga joined a financial firm in New York. Foster was among his first clients. He had signed with the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent, and he was not rich. He recalled one of his first phone calls from Lukanga, who had been reviewing his expenses.
"You spent $37 at Applebee's?" Lukanga shrieked. "Who do you think you are, man?"
Lukanga later left the firm to start his own business, Life Line Financial Group. Today, he considers himself more wellness manager than financial adviser. Spending habits, he says, are a reflection of personal values. And he wants his clients to be especially conservative with their money in their 20s.
"You're going to hate me in your 20s," he said. "But in your 30s, I'm going to be your best friend."
Many of his clients, he said, are young and Black and have built successful lives for themselves, so he feels a connection with them and wants to help empower them. He also wants them to avoid trapdoors.
"Unfortunately, it runs rampant in this industry," he said, "because things are happening so fast for you and your family, and you have to trust someone. You go from being a kid to now being a multimillion-dollar entity, and everyone has the answers for you. The best way I can describe it: You have to make life-altering decisions at a place in your life where you have the least foresight."
Foster said his girlfriend kept a running list of "Humbleisms" - Lukanga's proverbs about living with gratitude. For his part, Lukanga says he dedicates each day to someone who is no longer here. He often thinks of his father.
"I think some of my greatest peace," he said, "comes from knowing that I am his wildest dream."

Texto completo: Headnote John Singleton Dies
John Singleton, whose powerful debut film, "Boyz N the Hood," earned him an Oscar nomination for best director, the first for an African American, died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 51.
His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was confirmed in a family statement, after he was taken off life-support, The Associated Press reported. Singleton had been admitted to the hospital on April 17 after reportedly having a stroke.
His mother, Sheila Ward, said last week that he was in a coma and filed court papers last week asking to be appointed his temporary conservator. Several of his children at the time opposed her trying to take control of his medical and financial decision-making and publicly disputed her assessment of his medical state.
"Boyz N the Hood," a bleakly realistic film about three teenagers growing up amid gang violence in South Central Los Angeles, established Singleton's credentials and placed him in the conversation with more established African American directors like Spike Lee, Bill Duke, Julie Dash, Robert Townsend and Reginald Hudlin.
"When I was 18, I saw 'She's Gotta Have It,'" Singleton said, referring to Lee's 1986 breakthrough film, in a YouTube video in 2013. "The movie was so powerful to me, as a young black teen who grew up seeing movies with not a lot of people who looked like me."
He was 22 when he began shooting "Boyz," which follows Tre (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his friends Ricky (Morris Chestnut) and Doughboy (Ice Cube) as they try to avoid gangs and drugs. When Ricky is shot and killed by a gang member, Doughboy, his half brother, seeks revenge, but Tre backs away from retribution.
Singleton had graduated from film school less than a year earlier. He later conceded that when he made "Boyz N the Hood" he did not yet know how to direct a film.
"As the movie was going along, I was learning how to direct," he said after a 25th-anniversary screening of the film in Manhattan in 2016. "As it becomes more intense and comes on to the third act, the camerawork is more and more , fluid, because I'm getting better and better - and taking more chances."
After Columbia showed the movie at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival - with Lee in the audience - film critic Roger Ebert praised its "power, honesty and filmmaking skill." "By the end of 'Boyz N the Hood,'" he wrote, "I realized I had not simply seen a brilliant directorial debut, but an American film of enormous importance."
Violence erupted on the film's opening night in or near theaters; at least one person was killed and dozens were wounded around the country. But the movie did strong business, selling more than $123 million in tickets domestically in today's dollars.
Singleton lost the 1992 Academy Award for best director to Jonathan Demme, who won for "Silence of the Lambs." He was also nominated for best original screenplay, but Callie Khouri won that Oscar for "Thelma and Louise." Singleton remains the youngest Oscar nominee for best director.
No black filmmaker has won the Oscar for best director. But when Lee won this year for best adapted screenplay, for "BlacKkKlansman," Singleton was ecstatic.
"My brother Spike Lee just won his first Oscar," Singleton wrote on Twitter. "I'm sooo happy!"
John Daniel Singleton was born on Jan 6, 1968, in Los Angeles. His mother was a pharmaceutical sales executive, and his father, Danny Singleton, was a mortgage broker. He lived with his mother until he was 11 and then moved in with his father, on whom he based the character of Tre's father (played by Laurence Fishburne) in "Boyz."
John was influenced early on by movies like "Cooley High" (1975), a comedy-drama about high school friends living in the projects in Chicago, directed by Michael Schultz and starring Glynn Turman and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs.
Singleton was 7 when he saw the film with his mother. He recalled that she cried when Hilton-Jacobs' character was killed.
"I looked at my mother and I said, 'Why are you crying?,'" he said in a 2016 interview with Vanity Fair. "And she said, 'Because it's such a good movie.' So I start thinking, when I get to make a movie, I got to make people cry. I got to make them feel something."
From his mother's apartment in Inglewood he could see films playing at the local drive-in: horror, kung fu, blaxploitation and slasher movies.

Texto completo: A troupe of comedians hits the road in "On Tour With Asperger's Are Us." And Holocaust survivors share their stories in PBS's Frontline documentary.

What's on TV
ON TOUR WITH ASPERGER'S ARE US 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. After meeting at camp, Noah Britton, Ethan Finlan, Jack Hanke and New Michael Ingemi formed Asperger's Are Us, a sketch-comedy troupe that also offers postperformance talks about their experiences as comedians with Asperger's syndrome. This six-part documentary series, executive produced by Mark and Jay Duplass, follows the comics as they prepare to embark on their first nationwide tour, traveling from Boston to Los Angeles in an old RV.
30 FOR 30: THE DOMINICAN DREAM 9 p.m. on ESPN and ESPN Deportes. This "30 for 30" installment travels back to 1990s New York, where hordes of people were cramming into high school gymnasiums for the chance to see a teenage Felipe Lopez, a Dominican basketball phenom, play. Lopez, who's been compared to Michael Jordan and LeBron James, rose to stardom at Rice High School in Harlem, became a cover star for Sports Illustrated and then played college ball for St. John's University. In 1998, Lopez was drafted into the N.B.A., but his career never quite met the public's lofty expectations and lasted only five seasons. This documentary, directed by Jonathan Hock, traces Lopez's highs and lows, and explores his impact on immigrants in the community. It includes interviews with Alex Rodriguez, Chauncey Billups and Chris Mullin.
THE LAST SURVIVORS 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); Stream on PBS platforms. With the number of living Holocaust survivors growing smaller, this Frontline documentary strives to preserve their firsthand experiences as they near the end of their lives. In interviews, survivors talk about the grief and uncertainty they carry not knowing what happened to some of their family members. They discuss feelings of survivor's guilt, and how some of their children have experienced second-generation trauma. Their testimonies also touch on the recent rise in anti-Semitism around the world.

Poll says parents hinder their children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

For once, Trump actually wasn't lying about third-trimester abortion laws

Texto completo: Our president lies and simply says false things. A lot. Trump's relationship with the truth is tenuous at best, and at times, his lies don't even serve a real purpose.

But Trump didn't lie about the Democratic Party's recent embrace of third-trimester abortion laws. At a Wisconsin rally over the weekend, Trump said:

"Your Democrat governor here in Wisconsin, shockingly, stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born alive. Born alive. The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby."

Graphic? Sure. Inaccurate? Not really!

Trump here is specifically referring to the Wisconsin governor's plan to veto a Republican law which would make it illegal for doctors not to give medical care to babies born alive after a botched abortion. More than 50 abortions in Wisconsin last year were performed on pregnancies past the 20 week mark, widely accepted as the point of viability.

Democrats often argue that "born alive" protections are unnecessary because the scenario rarely ever occurs. Given existing abortion restrictions, this is mostly true. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that between 2003 and 2014, about 140 infant deaths resulted from abortions. But if it's so rare, why not just pass born alive laws? And if third-trimester laws such as those endorsed by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam actually do pass in multiple states, the number of attempted abortions resulting in a live birth will in fact increase.

And how did Northam defend his law?

"If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."

Trump may have used much stronger language than Northam, but really, all he did was explicate the eventual endpoint of the "discussion" that "would ensue between the physicians and the mother." Physicians have a legal and ethical duty to provide life-saving care in case of emergencies. What Northam described here was an abdication of that duty to a living, breathing human being.

Of course, that hasn't stopped the media from accusing Trump of lying.

"Trump's Lies about abortion keep getting more disturbing," writes Hannah Gold at The Cut.

The New York Times called Trump's claim "false" but conceded that "the family may choose to provide just comfort care — wrapping and cuddling the baby — and allow the child to die naturally without extreme attempts at resuscitation." Again, given a physician's inherent duty to save lives in emergencies, the deprivation of care is tantamount to murder.

Vice News called "Trump's lies ... outrageous and dangerous."

Again, where is the lie?

It's fine and fair to point out how that current abortion law results in the termination of relatively few viable babies. But that's no excuse to not provide protection for those born alive, and certainly not one to baselessly accuse the president of lying when, for once, he's telling the cold, hard truth.

Stagecoach 2019: Sam Hunt closes out the second night with a big ‘ol dance party

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

Texto completo: On the front page of The New York Times, the font was as big and as bold as it had ever been. The date was July 21, 1969, and the headline read, "MEN WALK ON MOON."
The United States had just won an enormous victory in space, and left an indelible boot print on civilization. It will be 50 years this July since Neil Armstrong's "one small step for man," and to commemorate this anniversary we have historian Douglas Brinkley's timely new book, "American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race."
By the time President Kennedy assumed office in January 1961, the United States was the world's preeminent political, military and economic power. Kennedy's predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, led the creation of the Interstate Highway System, the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the intercontinental ballistic missile. What was to be Kennedy's legacy? Space exploration. In 1962, he challenged the nation "to commit itself to achieving this goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth."
For Kennedy, prestige and propaganda victories mattered greatly, and the Soviets had already bested the United States twice in space in the five years prior to Kennedy's election. They launched the world's first orbital satellite, Sputnik, which, Brinkley opines, was probably the USSR's greatest achievement in the Cold War. This was followed by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin completing the world's first manned space mission.
Eisenhower was against both the militarization of space and going tit-for-tat with the Russians. He rejected the idea that prestige should motivate U.S. foreign policy, going as far to say that "anybody who would spend $40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts."
Kennedy, by contrast, was a "prestige maven" and conflated winning the space race with winning the contest of democracy and free-market capitalism over communism. He believed that space was "America's Cold War Manifest Destiny," and that the moon was the ultimate prize. Congress agreed, and in 1963 the total budget was larger than any proposed by any president in history, even by Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the height of WWII.
Journalist Edward R. Murrow, who worked in the Kennedy administration, was not very keen on the idea of shooting for the moon; however, he believed that if the United States was going to do it, a person of color should be sent into space. Most of the world isn't white, Murrow argued, and if the U.S. could put an African-American or a Native American or a Latino, it would say a lot about our culture of inclusion. Nobody listened to Murrow.
Others thought the space race was a gross misappropriation of funds. "It will cost thirty-five billion dollars to put two men on the moon," National Urban League President Whitney Young wrote. "It would take ten billion dollars to lift every poor person in this county above the official poverty standard this year. Something is wrong somewhere."
By making the moon shot a national priority, resources, energy and rhetoric were directed away from societal problems such as systemic poverty and segregation. Furthermore, Brinkley gushes that "Kennedy's Moonshot challenge has stood as the green light reminding us that together as a society we can accomplish virtually any feat." Together? This is a story about white men only, and it was the Russians, incidentally, who put the first woman into space.
Nevertheless, Kennedy ushered in a new era and introduced a "New Frontier" ethic which emphasized the importance of science education. He made direct appeals to the public arguing that the space race was also a race for education and research.
When Eisenhower left office there were essentially no computer science programs at American universities, but by 1963 such departments had been established at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and Stanford universities, among others. Kennedy was also an early proponent of the National Defense Education Act, which increased funding for what are now STEM disciplines.
There have been other lasting returns on this investment. While working to master space flight, scientists laid the foundation for satellite television, microchips, solar panels, water purification systems, carbon monoxide detectors, and GPS. Furthermore, space medicine research led to the development of radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer, CAT and MRI scans, and kidney dialysis machines.
If a Democratic presidential candidate asked for $185 billion (which the moon shot would cost in today's dollars) for a program that had no guarantee of success, they'd have a better chance of flying to the moon themselves than getting the money. With Kennedy, however, "the man and the hour had met" and the goal was met in large part thanks to his successor's doggedness. Lyndon B. Johnson equated criticism of NASA with a "soft on communism" attitude, and whenever Congress considered slashing the Apollo program, Johnson invoked the martyred JFK with a "don't-you-dare" political mastery.
Kennedy's space program was the heart and soul of his New Frontier. His demand that the United States lead the world in space discovery stimulated the country and accelerated the pace of technological innovation.
The Apollo 11 moon landing - which had, in Neil Armstrong's calculations, a 50/50 chance of success - provided a sense of national pride and excellence so lasting that it took the dawn of a new millennium for readers of The New York Times to be greeted by a headline as big or as bold.

'Latinx' term highlights divisions

Texto completo: The paradox of working in media is that even as your mind expands, your world also shrinks a bit. Because of my job, I read a lot of news, then go on Twitter to read people's hot takes, then listen to podcasts, you know, just to round out the picture. It's extra, for sure. But while there's no question that my understanding of topics like foreign relations, economics and the president's taxes, to name a few, has gone from zero to at least 80 in the last few years, the overexposure has also distorted my perception about what "everyone" knows.
Fortunately our readers keep me accountable. In my last column, for example, I used the word "Latinx" as a broader term for the Latino community, to some people's perplexity.
¿Latin-qué?
Latinx, meant to be a more feminist, inclusive term that also considers transgender folks or those who don't identify with the gender binary, has started to pop up more frequently in recent years. So many explainers and articles and videos have been created about why it should or should not be used. The phrase is widely adopted on college campuses and by activists, and in September, Merriam-Webster added it to the dictionary. But many are still critical of the word, and they expressed as much in our Facebook comments.
In part, it's a linguistic issue: Latinx just doesn't translate to Spanish, some argued. A commenter from Ohio wrote that, if you're a Spanish speaker, "the term Latinx reads like a thousand nails in a thousand blackboards." Some readers in Latin America said it was an Anglicization that wasn't relevant in their home countries. Another implied that the term is elitist, writing that the word Latinx "ostracizes all the speakers of Spanish who don't have wealth or time to pontificate the 'oppression' of a language which at its very root genders everything." In a very official poll on my personal Facebook page, some friends and family said that they'd never even heard of it.
So, should it be used at all?
Linguists have mixed feelings.
Kim Potowski, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in Spanish linguistics, tried to employ inclusive language in a forthcoming Spanish grammar book, but replacing the masculine "O" throughout overwhelmed her and her co-writer, Naomi L. Shin. "It came to a point where we said, 'You know what, we're not ready,'" she said. Maybe in the fourth or fifth edition of the book, she added, "we will have those X's in there."
"There is absolutely no consensus among linguists," Potowski said.
Another scholar, Lourdes Torres, a professor of Latino studies at DePaul University in Chicago, argues that the word Latinx undermines hard-fought feminist battles. "In its attempt to be gender-inclusive," she said, "one can argue that it's gender-erasing of women who have fought for a long time to not just have Latino, but to have Latino/Latina, to make sure women are represented."
But they do agree that language evolves with the culture.
"As social factors change, sometimes the language has to change," Torres said. "The people who use the language are the ones who determine what it is." She and Potowski both gave words like "presidenta" or "jefa" as examples; neither existed until women entered the workforce and took on those roles.
Ed Morales, a Columbia University professor who wrote "Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture," agrees. In a recent conversation he said that "the X, which is so strange and is not Spanish, sort of marks this new hybrid idea." The title of his book, similarly, was meant to be forward-looking. "I thought it was a futurist term," he said, "imagining a future of more inclusion for people that don't conform to the various kinds of rigid identities that exist in the United States."
Still, the arbiter of Spanish is the Real Academia Espa�ola. That entity decides which words make it into the dictionary, and they're not big fans of Spanglish or Spanish words developed in the United States. In 2012, they added a definition for "estadounidismo," which translates to Americanism. At first, Torres said, the word was categorized as a "deformation of Spanish." Linguists had to push for them to change the official entry.
Dialectical hierarchy is nothing new. Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, for instance, are criticized for dropping word endings or using inventive slang. It's significant that the Real Academia recognized American Spanish in its pages, but why is it widely perceived as being less valid than the Spanish dialects spoken in other countries?
American Spanish is for the youth
Many young, American Latinos believe that Spain's official ruling on language erases our African and indigenous roots in favor of European values. Some have argued that Latinx is partly a nod to the gender fluidity that existed among Natives before colonization.
Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, and many Hispanic adults feel that it is important for their succeeding generations to keep the language alive in this country. Inevitably, though, new words that meld Spanish and English will be introduced.
Both Morales and Torres said feminist and queer circles in Latin America are experimenting with their own terms. "We're not creating this change in Latin America," Torres said. "They recognize that their language, like all languages, is sexist. All languages are sexist because we live under the patriarchy everywhere."
The value of the X is that it "provokes conversation about who we're including and who we're not including in our communities," she said. But that doesn't mean everybody has to use it.
"If you talk to my dad or my tia, that's just another silly academic or political thing," Torres said. "It's definitely of a certain world."
Still, she said, even if the terms are not always understood, it's important to be "inclusive of all those identities that have had less visibility in our conversations, in our books, in our movies." If we can, she said, "it would be a really powerful thing."

Texto completo: After years of speculation and false starts, Thursday was the day when Joe Biden finally announced his third attempt at running for president.
He's in a good position, better than most.
"Pretty much 80 percent of the Democratic fundraising establishment are pretty much all on board," said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, one of Biden's key backers. According to reports, a number of big Wall Street donors have held off backing other candidates, waiting for Biden.
He's been leading the polls for months, well ahead of other candidates who have already announced, including Elizabeth Warren and rising star Pete Buttigieg.
He has nearly 100 percent name ID and will reportedly have a number of former President Obama's key staff on his team.
However, despite all this good fortune and circumstance, Biden is in for a rude, rude awakening.
This isn't your grandfather's — or Joe Biden's — Democratic Party anymore. His record, which includes backing the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, boosting the credit card industry and disrespecting and dismissing Anita Hill's sexual harassment claims, puts him in a precarious place among progressives who view him through a distinctly 2019 prism. But it's also his bad luck of genetics and age that make him a target of the new left, who do not want an old white guy to be the next Democratic nominee.
The incoming he's already received is just a small taste of what's to come.
Here was progressive commentator Joan Walsh on CNN:
"You've got Joe Biden as the white grandfather in all of this, the white man saying it's a white man's culture. OK. It's got to change. I have an idea for how he can change it. Don't run."
And Frank Bruni in The New York Times:
Biden "spent nearly 45 years in Washington, a proper noun that's a dirty word in presidential politics," and "his record includes laws and episodes that are reviled — rightly — by the female and black voters so integral to the Democratic Party."
And progressive author and activist Sally Kohn in USA Today: "Biden is a conventional, corporate centrist Democrat. He is from the Great Banking State of Delaware, after all. A 2008 Pro Publica report detailed just how cozy Biden's relationship has been with the credit card industry — including the fact that the financial services company MBNA was Biden's single largest contributor for 20 years."
For the wokest and leftiest among us, these criticisms are fair and uncontroversial.
But for many others, it seems like bizarro world.
For example, Biden will get no credit among progressives for memorably pushing the last Democratic president, Obama, toward gay marriage equality. He'll get no credit for backing gun control legislation long before Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill, or drafting the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994. And he's just as confused by the progressives' attacks on him. As he said in March, "I have the most progressive record of anybody who would run." That last point is debatable, but his frustration is understandable.
To that end, Biden shouldn't waste time bending left for progressives. His gift will be courting moderates and independents, the left-behind Blue Dog Democrats in the Rust Belt, some of whom voted for Donald Trump. He speaks their language fluently, more so than any other candidate.
If he can avoid the progressive pitfalls that will dare him to abolish ICE and support a wacky and implausible Green New Deal, promise free college and health care for all, wipe out all debt and tax us all through the roof, he has the best shot at defeating Trump in a general election. Many progressives know this, but oppose him in spite of it. But Democrats have to ask themselves: Do they want purity or do they want to win?

Texto completo: In her new memoir, "Life Will Be the Death of Me," comedian, author and talk-show host Chelsea Handler writes about how the election of President Donald J. Trump drove her to therapy, where she unraveled a rich tapestry of issues dating to the death of her brother. She writes about how she is now a better, calmer person, the kind of person who meditates.
She also -- and this is the part everyone wants to talk about -- details her infatuation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His still-impressive abs and hair inspire "strong sexual feelings," she writes, as does his stern dedication to bedrock legal principles. There's more, but we can't print it.
If there is one thing Handler has learned on her ongoing promotional tour (which reaches the Athenaeum Theatre on Friday night for a show that will also feature "Will & Grace" star Sean Hayes), it's that she is not alone.
"There are millions of other people, a whole underground railroad of people, that are attracted to Robert Mueller and didn't know it was OK to say it," Handler marvels in a phone interview. "And his sunglasses! Did you see the picture of him yesterday pulling into work? I mean, he's so hot. I'm sorry, there is no one hotter than Robert Mueller."
Until November 2016, Handler lived a prickly but essentially unchallenged life. She hosted several talk shows -- including "Chelsea Lately" on E!, and more recently "Chelsea" on Netflix -- had a successful stand-up career and was a bestselling memoirist.
Handler, 44, born and raised in New Jersey, had a house in Bel Air, A-list friends such as Jennifer Aniston, and a raft of assistants upon whom she was so dependent that she was unable to bathe without her housekeeper because Handler couldn't figure out how to turn the shower on.
After the election, the primal howl of the outside world, or the Democratic part of it anyway, began to pierce the mortifying bubble of her privilege.
"When you make a living out of being a loudmouth and telling everybody what's wrong with them, but never, ever tackle what's wrong with you, and you get rewarded for that behavior, you think that's good," she says. "You think, OK, this is cool. I can say whatever I want, and I just keep getting rewarded for it -- a TV show, a book deal, a stand-up tour.
You become very spoiled. I became very entitled, and there was always something digging at me."
Handler entered therapy, where she realized that her inchoate post-election rage might not have had much to do with the election after all.
"My brother died when I was 9, and my family kind of fell apart," she says. "I lost my brother, and then my father may as well have been gone too. That was a trigger for me, Trump's election, and 'trigger' is not a word I love to throw around, but it was the best way to describe what happened to so many of us.
"Trump becoming president felt like the world was unhinged."
In therapy, Handler realized that the death of her brother, the person to whom she was closest in a family to which she felt otherwise unconnected, untethered her connection to others and to her own feelings.
"I didn't realize it, but people thought I had no emotion," she says.
As an adult, she was the one her friends turned to in a crisis, the one who coolly took charge. She could feel sympathy, but not empathy. She was sorry for people when bad things happened to them but was incapable of understanding how they felt. Empathy was something Handler only recently learned.
"I practice it every single day: 'OK, think about what that person goes home to.' " she said. "It was a muscle that I didn't have."
Handler, who had spent years in a constant whir of work and travel to avoid spending time with her feelings, still screams at parking attendants but generally is a more patient, grounded person than she used to be. She feels happier and almost normal.
"This is the beginning of being on the right track again," Handler said. "Sometimes we get off track in our lives, and it's usually a result of something that happened many years prior. When faced with it, and really digging deep, you can really clean out that injury. I have a whole new world ahead of me now."
Helping with all this is that Handler smokes a lot of pot, which quieted her mind to the point where she could learn how to meditate, which she now does every morning. After a career spent skewering Hollywood types, Handler has become the kind of person she used to mock.
She takes consciousness-expanding drugs with a shaman, and talks a lot about being "present." She says she doesn't worry about losing her edge.
"I'm not going on, like, a silent retreat anytime soon.," she said. "I'm still cynical. The funny and the silly and all that, I still have it in spades."
Handler has dedicated much of her new life to activism. She wants to do things that matter, things that are real. She sponsors Syrian refugees, is working on a documentary for Netflix about white privilege,and hopes to write more "serious" books like "Life Will Be The Death of Me," which currently tops the New York Times' bestseller list.
It's a disarmingly, unblinkingly honest work, and Handler has been gratified by the warm public reaction.
"I've never been vulnerable before, so people are just pouring out their stories to me.," she said. "I've heard so many stories about death and grief. I'm so overwhelmed and I love it.
"I'm like, 'Oh. This is what it's like to do something good.' "

Texto completo: CQ-Roll Call
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden officially entered the 2020 race for president Thursday at the top of the polls, with universal name recognition and the still-fresh sheen of his time as a popular vice president to Barack Obama.
In a video posted to his social media platforms, Biden characterized the race as a “battle for the soul of this nation.”
“If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation — who we are — and I cannot stand by and watch that happen,” he says in the 3½-minute video.
Biden brings 40 years of political baggage that could force him to explain or apologize for dozens of past positions that are out of step with a Democratic Party that is being pulled further left.
How Biden chooses to frame a Washington record that stretches back to the Nixon administration could determine the course of his candidacy.
“I don’t believe there’s any precedent for a candidate like Biden,” who cast thousands of votes on the Senate floor and in committee during his career, said Joesph Pika, a professor emeritus at the University of Delaware who has followed Biden’s career.
“All those votes can be sliced and diced by critics to prove almost anything they want — inconsistencies, errors in judgment, wrong choices,” Pika said. “And with experience in national office spanning nearly a half century, the issues have changed and evolved, as has the expert thinking about best solutions.”
During Biden’s decades in the Senate, he championed “tough-on-crime” criminal justice policies now thought to have contributed to mass incarceration, a modern civil rights issue that could be important in early-voting states such as South Carolina. He cast votes that would have curtailed women’s access to abortions. And he pushed for the passage of a law that stripped bankruptcy protections from millions of Americans in 2005.
It remains to be seen how much his opponents will focus on that history during the Democratic primary campaign, which still is in its early phase. But even before he announced his candidacy, Biden was already positioning himself to respond to critics from the “New Left.”
“I’ve got the most progressive record of anyone running,” he said at a March event in Delaware. Biden’s campaign did not respond to interview requests for this story.
Biden’s supporters and some political experts have described now-controversial positions as the unavoidable legacy of a career in national politics that dates back to 1973 — before some of his opponents were even born. Biden, who has waged two previous presidential bids and served eight years in the Obama White House, arguably has been vetted more thoroughly than any other candidate.
“If he has to respond to everything he did in 1974, it’s going to be an unpleasant campaign for him,” said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist who specializes in the Senate. “I think he has to make a statement right at the outset that times have changed. He has changed with the times, as have many people.”
But despite his time on the public stage, Biden’s record could get a new airing and his popularity could dip if opponents decide to seize on aspects of his past that have not aged well.
“He’s much too big of a fish to be ignored by his rivals, and they’ll have to tear him down,” columnist Matt Yglesias wrote for website Vox in January. “The entire spectacle of once again re-fighting every intraparty battle from the past two generations would be bad for almost everyone at a time when Democrats should be talking about their ideas for the future.”
But Biden may be able to point to his more recent actions as evidence that his views have evolved.
He was one of 32 Democratic senators, for example, to vote in 1996 for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. But by 2012, he had declared his full support for gay marriage on national television, propelling Obama, who had been lukewarm on the topic, to do the same a few days later.
Biden, a practicing Catholic, voted in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s against federal funding for abortions and to override President Bill Clinton’s veto of a controversial ban on the late-term procedure termed “partial birth” abortions. Those views had evolved by the time he was in the White House. In 2012, he said the government does not have “a right to tell other people that women, they can’t control their body,” according to The New York Times.
“Reproductive freedom is under threat in unprecedented ways, and we hope that all potential and announced candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, including Joe Biden, will stand up for reproductive freedom in bold and decisive ways,” said Amanda Thayer, deputy national communications director of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights advocacy group.
Biden can point to his obligation as a senator to protect businesses in his state to explain his vote for the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which passed the Senate, 74-25. That measure made it more difficult to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and was considered disastrous for middle-class families struggling with credit card debt. But it was a boon to the banking giants headquartered in Delaware, a major employer of Biden’s constituents.
Civil rights groups have largely considered Biden an ally, but he also has never run before in a field with several African American opponents, at a time when groups like Black Lives Matter are pressing candidates to confront issues of race head-on. As a result, he could face more pressure to answer for early positions on school desegregation and criminal justice overhaul.
One of the first fights Biden waged as a young senator was his passionate opposition to court-ordered busing of students, which was unpopular among white voters in Delaware. The battle put him at odds with the country’s first popularly elected black senator, Massachusetts Republican Edward W. Brooke, and much of his party.
Jason Sokul, a historian at the University of New Hampshire who has studied the episode, said he has not seen any evidence that Biden’s views about busing have changed.
“If he believes he was wrong, he could say he was wrong and he could attempt to come up with some legislation to try to make a dent in the problem of school segregation,” Sokul said. “But it’s not clear to me that he thinks he was wrong.”
In contrast, Biden has attempted to distance himself from some of the hard-line stances he took on criminal justice. The 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act he sponsored and the bipartisan 1994 Violent Crime Control Act he championed are now thought to have ushered in the era of mass incarceration.
“You know I’ve been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,” Biden said at a Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in January. “I haven’t always been right. I know we haven’t always gotten things right, but I’ve always tried.”
Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group that promotes an overhaul of sentencing laws, said members of both parties at the time were competing to show who could be the toughest on crime.
“I don’t think that absolves knowledgeable leaders for being responsible for understanding what was going on,” he said.
He also noted, however, that when Biden was vice president, he advocated a relaxation of strict sentencing laws, which ultimately was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018.
“If he were to be in the White House, I would be cautiously optimistic that he would carry forward the reform agenda that he shared in the Obama administration,” Mauer said.

Texto completo: The audience's heckling of Sen. Bernie Sanders started when he offered a stem-winder of a response to a question about how he planned to attract the support of women of color.
The Democratic presidential hopeful veered into an explanation of why party unity was crucial to defeating President Donald Trump, whose presidency he said had worsened racism, sexism, and homophobia. He pledged that even if he doesn’t win that he’d do “everything" to ensure that the Democratic nominee becomes the next president.
The grumbling crowd, made up predominantly of women of color, at Wednesday’s She the People presidential forum in Houston let it be known that they weren’t satisfied with his answer.
“What about black women?” someone in the crowd shouted.
One of the moderators, MSNBC’s Joy Reid, nudged Sanders back to the question: Why should black women support him?
“Black women will be an integral part of what our campaign and what our administration is about,” said Sanders, a response that elicited more grumbles and boos.
During his 2016 run for the White House, Sanders trumpeted the need for leadership that would fight corporate interests that were at odds with average working Americans. He more often spoke about inequity in terms of class rather than race, a framing of the issue that rubbed some minority voters the wrong way.
In the lead-up to the 2020 race, Sanders and his campaign have sought to underscore their efforts to win support of minority voters. In 2016, Hillary Clinton overwhelming won the African American vote by more than 50 percentage points during the Democratic nomination fight.

But the episode Wednesday, suggests Sanders still has work to do as he makes his case to black voters.
Bernard Fraga, an assistant professor of political science at Indiana University, said that despite the stumble Sanders still has time to make inroads with black voters, who in 2016 made up 25% of the Democratic primary electorate.
“I think what he needs to do is lead with how his policies best address some of the issues that black women voters care about,” Fraga said.
Sanders faced also criticism over the fact his 2016 campaign was dominated by a mostly white leadership team. As he prepared to launch his 2020 campaign, Sanders publicly apologized after a New York Times report detailed women staffers' complaints they were sexually harassed and paid less during the 2016 campaign.
In the early going of the 2020 campaign, he’s hammered at the need for the federal government to promote policies that will end institutional racism and invest in urban communities. Earlier this week, Sanders expressed the controversial position that he supports allowing felons to vote even while they are in prison – an issue that has disproportionately impacted the African American community.
His stump speeches now often include an argument about how racism has exacerbated financial inequality. He’s also more frequently made reference to his own connection to the fight for Civil Rights, including attending the 1963 March on Washington, serving as a leader of the Congress of Racial Equality chapter during his time as a student at the University of Chicago, and getting arrested at an anti-segregation protest.

During the She the People event, Sanders tried to pivot to some of his backstory, noting his support for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and being one of the few white elected officials to back the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign.
“I have dedicated my life to the fight against racism and sexism and discrimination of all forms,” Sanders said.
The crowd responded with more grumbles and boos.

Texto completo: Tom Friedman, a New York Times star columnist, wrote a column entitled “The Green New Deal” 11 years ago. In this he proposed to invest vast sums to reinvent the energy industry. Conservatives (e.g., me) examine all visionary proposals with three assumptions in mind: Governments invariably over-promise, under-deliver, and overspend. We were pleased that Tom’s grand scheme was first ignored, then forgotten.
Now the “Green New Deal” (GND) reappears as an insanely grandiose scheme, popularized by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC). Where Friedman aimed to head off an economic recession, AOC aims at nothing less than the transformation of America’s economy and society.
Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel came near to tears of laughter while reading AOC’s Green New Deal blueprint. Here I depart from Strassel’s evaluation and give AOC the credit she deserves. Americans are accustomed to dismissing their political leadership as clowns, but most of those clowns (Dem and GOP) give more cause for irritation than mirth. Alexandria, by contrast, is a clown with real comedic value. Consider some of the vivacious buffoon’s best boffos, contained in a background document issued by her office. She proposes to upgrade every building in the U.S. in 10 years; phase out nuclear power; and mobilize the nation to achieve “net zero” emissions in 10years by meeting 100% of America’s power demand “through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.”
Sounds like a lot right there, but she’s just beginning. She would give the government a decade to install a high-speed rail network to replace air travel. This is a key to her project for “overhauling transportation systems in the United States.”
She aims to provide “economic security for all people of the United States;” “restore and protect threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems;” “provide resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States.” Let’s not forget her desire to “guarantee a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States”? And, like all contenders for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination she pledges to provide “all people of the United States” with “high-quality health care.”
There are two forces driving AOC’s vast and all-encompassing plan for transforming the United States. First, she is convinced that socialism provides the ideas and means by which whole societies may be transformed. Second, she believes that the earth is warming so rapidly that we will see the end of all animal life on our planet in twelve years.
The socialism in which she puts her faith is not like any socialism ever tried, but its exact opposite (i.e., successful socialism). The source of her certainties about the coming ecological doomsday is less clear. She never took a course in climatology, nor ever distinguished herself in any other field of scientific study. I’m guessing that her conviction is derived from one or more websites, but that’s merely a guess, supported by no documentation.
I’ve read that some polls claim that 80% of Democrats support her Green New Deal. Sen. Kamala Harris, in the front rank of aspiring presidential nominees, has signed on as sponsor of a GND resolution written by AOC and Senator Markey (D-Mass). No Democrat seeking a lease on the Oval Office has a word to say against it.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader, saw an opportunity he couldn’t resist. He placed the GND resolution before the Senate. His plan was to get the Democratic senators on the record. Ocasio-Cortez pointed out what the devious old man was up to: “[McConnell] is trying to bully the party and he’s banking on people not being courageous. I think people should call his bluff.”
As it happens, the Democratic senators chose not to call his bluff. They did not vote for the resolution. They did not vote against it. All but two voted “present.” This is how a politician evades “transparency” – a thing they all praise; a thing they all avoid if possible.

From the sports desk: Appreciate regular season achievements

Texto completo: The team also finished with the fourth-most points ever for a team in its regular season and had the sport's top scorer.
But the team has been described as "losers" and should be "embarrassed" by its performance.
Why? It lost in the first round of the playoffs. This is absurd.
The Tampa Bay Lightning recently completed one of the most successful regular seasons in NHL history. They won 62 games, amassed 128 points, and earned a top seed in the playoffs. All-Star forward Nikita Kucherov had 41 goals and a league-leading 128 points.
They were favorites to springboard that success into the postseason and win the Stanley Cup.
Easy, right? Not quite. Of the last 32 teams to have won the Presidents' Trophy (for having the best record), just eight teams won Stanley Cup titles, according to the New York Times.
The last team to have the best regular season record and also win the Stanley Cup was the 2012-13 Chicago Blackhawks. The 2011-12 Los Angeles Kings won the championship as a No. 8 seed (which included defeating the regular season's best team in the first round).
The Washington Capitals had the best record in 2015-16 and 2016-17 and did not win the Stanley Cup. But last season, with the seventh-best regular season record, the Capitals won their first title.
In 1995-96, the Detroit Red Wings won a league-best 62 games and had 131 points. No Cup.
Which is why the narrative that the Lightning, who were swept in the first round by the Columbus Blue Jackets (47 wins, 98 points), should be labeled as losers (such as a Tampa Bay Times columnist suggested) is flawed.
Being the best team during the regular season - in any sport - doesn't guarantee the same success in the postseason, especially in hockey when there's a small talent gap between the top teams and those who barely qualified for the playoffs.
An 82-game regular season measures the best team from October to April.
The grind of four rounds of playoff intensity often is measured by a singular favorable series matchup (some teams match up better against others) and of course, luck. A hit post, a bouncing puck, a goalie's diving stick save.
Last season's Boston Red Sox won a baseball best 108 games and then in the playoffs beat the Yankees, Astros and Dodgers to win the World Series. They were the exception.
Since 1969, just 13 teams have had the best MLB record in the regular season and then won the World Series. In the NFL, since 1975, only 13 times have the top teams in each conference competed against each other in the Super Bowl (per the Pro Football Hall of Fame's website).
And the No. 1 seed has never won the title in the five years of the College Football Playoff.
It's hard to get to a title game or series and difficult to win "the double," which is a phrase often associated with soccer. In many soccer leagues worldwide, the team that wins the regular season title is celebrated. Trophies are awarded and the players are hailed as heroes for generations (in 2018, a parade for Manchester City celebrating its championship in the regular season drew a reported 100,000 supporters).
Then, the team tries to accomplish the task of winning a postseason tournament championship.
In England, home of the Premier League, the double (winning the regular season crown and FA Cup) has been achieved just 11 times since 1888 and not since 2010.
It's understood that it's a challenge to win both titles, which is why the accomplishments are celebrated as standalone achievements. Some teams also vie for the coveted Champions League crown, which is another separate soccer tournament.
The end to the Lightning's season is certainly disappointing, but hardly embarrassing (as Deadspin suggests). Sure, losing in the first round is a quick exit, but any result short of a title would have been labeled unsatisfactory.
Instead of instantly admonishing a team for having the audacity to lose a short series, try to appreciate the long season's accomplishments and recognize that winning a postseason championship is not a sure thing, but a laborious task that takes talent and often a bit of luck to achieve.

Texto completo: When he told the president that a “real lawyer” take notes, then-White House counsel Don McGahn showed he understood a lawyer’s proper function. He knew that a lawyer’s job is to advise clients about what the law allows and also what it prohibits. Notes are a symbol of a deeper reality — that truth and facts are at the core of the rule of law, and that lawyers are the guardians of those values.
President Donald Trump's ongoing assault on the rule of law seeks most basically to prevent lawyers from performing this role. Leading up to the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, we saw multiple news accounts, some based on unidentified administration officials and other sources, about a president directing law enforcement agents to ignore judicial orders; working to hollow out a vital domestic law enforcement agency, the Department of Homeland Security, because its leaders will not bend to his will; and suggesting that he will punish his political opponents by targeting them for adverse actions.
And to facilitate those and other actions, the president has taken steps to remove lawyers and other officials from their positions because they adhere to the rule of law and refuse to permit him to ignore it. A president should not fire his Homeland Security secretary for refusing to follow an illegal directive. A president cannot order the Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents for fictitious crimes, as The New York Times reports, and no president should ever contemplate ordering immigration authorities to release detainees in the home cities of his political opponents.
Read more commentary:
Barr's Mueller report rollout was disgraceful. I can't believe it but I miss Jeff Sessions.
What would Republicans do with a Mueller report? Build an impeachment case.
I've warned that impeachment talk is dangerous, but the time has come: Laurence Tribe
We should be especially concerned by pressure on lawyers and threats to oust them. They are the ones forcing this administration to hew to statutory and constitutional limitations. The resiliency of the American experiment and the power of traditional ideals of limited government, the rule of law, and checks on executive authority are, to a very real degree, in these lawyers’ hands.
McGahn stood up to Trump, Barr did not
And now the Mueller report gives us even more evidence of the president’s disdain for legal constraints. Three times he asked McGahn to assist him in legally dubious acts. Three times McGahn refused. McGahn refused to tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation; he refused to fire Mueller; and he refused to lie about the president’s requests that he fire Mueller. He stood in defense of the rule of law. The president, by contrast, said he wished his attorney was Roy Cohn — a man who was disbarred from the practice of law for his criminality and dishonesty.
Also disturbing is the recent conduct of Attorney General William Barr, our nation’s chief law enforcement officer. Mueller’s report convincingly demonstrates systematic actions by the president to obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation, irrespective of whether a sitting president can be indicted. Despite this, the attorney general, acting more like a presidential defense attorney than a representative of the American public, ignored the impact of Mueller's negative findings and stated refusal to exculpate the president from a charge of obstruction.
Lawyers are a bulwark against chaos
These and other recent steps to secure a narrow political advantage by impairing our legal institutions and undermining faith in them are a gross offense to the idea that no man or woman is above the law. In the end, all of our liberties, and our democratic system of government, depend upon maintaining the rule of law by reliance on the independent judiciary, the separation of powers and limited government.
Shakespeare knew the dangers of what President Trump is doing. In "Henry VI," Dick the butcher and Jack Cade are plotting a traitorous revolution against society and they recognize that the first thing they need to do to create chaos, eliminate liberty, and advance autocracy is to destroy what binds a society together — that is, to end the rule of law that is a bulwark against authoritarian rule. And so they say, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers. ”

Texto completo: A Colorado State University professor, poet and essayist was recently awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, likely becoming the first woman at CSU to receive one.
Camille Dungy, a professor in the university's Department of English, was one of 168 scholars, artists and writers awarded the fellowship this year, according SOURCE, CSU's website on campus-related news.
Dungy plans to use the undisclosed fellowship funding on "Soil," a project she described to SOURCE as "a deep exploration into the intersection of an accelerating environmental crisis and socio-cultural issues around love, family, survival and care."
"This honor means more than I can easily put into words," Dungy added. "So many of my heroes are also Guggenheim Fellows, and to be honored in this same way feels like a culmination of a great deal of hard work."
Former Guggenheim Fellowship recipients from CSU include James Bamburg (biochemistry) in 1978, Richard Tracy (zoology) in 1980, Jorge M. Vivanco (rhizosphere biology) in 2007 and Dan Beachy-Quick (English) in 2015.
Though Dungy has been published in the New York Times Magazine, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and won a Colorado Book Award for her poetry last year, she considers the Guggenheim Fellowship the highest honor she has received, according to SOURCE.

THE NATION; The president lashes out at his critics; Trump's Twitter storm of grievance reflects a deepening agitation over recent events.

Texto completo: Just days after claiming exoneration by the redacted special counsel report into Russian intervention in the 2016 election, President Trump is back to playing the victim.
For a second straight day, the president remained inside the White House -- his relatively light schedule allowing ample time for television and Twitter.
On Tuesday morning, Trump lashed out at a number of news organizations with incendiary and mostly false claims. He demanded an apology "on their knees" from the New York Times, mocked two cable show hosts by name, accused Twitter of limiting his followers and claimed that Democrats and the "Fake News Media ... have gone totally insane."

It wasn't the vitriol that was noteworthy so much as the volume, with the president punching out 50 tweets or retweets in a 24-hour span, telegraphing his deepening agitation even as he claims he's unruffled by recent events.
The belligerence was reminiscent of other days when Trump channeled his frustration into a barrage of 280-character bursts, such as a rainy Sunday in January, during the 35-day government shutdown, when alone in the White House he banged out 40 tweets.
Beyond tweeting at a breakneck pace, Trump held his only newsworthy meeting of the day with the man who created his favorite social media platform, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey.
Trump disclosed the meeting, which had not been listed on his official public schedule, in a tweet.
"Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general," Trump wrote after the meeting. "Look forward to keeping an open dialogue!"
Most of the morning's tweets, fired off in rapid succession as the president offered his real-time reactions to cable news, were laden less with gratitude than grievance.
In one, Trump suggested that the country's strong economy should inoculate him from media scrutiny and pointed vaguely -- and inaccurately -- to recent history as proof.
"In the 'old days' if you were president and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism," Trump tweeted. "Remember, 'It's the economy stupid.' Today I have, as president, perhaps the greatest economy in history ... and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!"
President Clinton, who was twice elected by focusing on the economy, was impeached by the House in 1998 despite overseeing a prolonged economic boom. He was acquitted in the Senate and served out his term.
Trump also tweeted about his scheduled rally Saturday night in Green Bay, Wis., which will take place at the same time as the annual White House Correspondents Assn. dinner in Washington, an event he has refused to attend since taking office.
Later, Trump ordered all administration officials to boycott the annual fundraising gala, which hundreds of Washington reporters and guests will attend.
Trump said Monday he was "not even a little bit" concerned that some Democrats had called for impeachment hearings in light of disclosures in the final report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that indicated Trump repeatedly sought to impede the Russia investigation.
But his extended online outburst Tuesday indicates otherwise, as a new poll showed Trump's net approval rating dip to the lowest point of his presidency since the Mueller report's release on Thursday.
According to two administration officials, Trump is angry at former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who was cited 157 times in Mueller's report and whose testimony provided the most damaging evidence of the president's attempts to obstruct the investigation -- most notably, his repeated instructions to McGahn to fire Mueller in June 2017.
Trump, eager to lift the cloud of investigations that has overshadowed his entire presidency, is also upset about Democrats' plans to call both McGahn and Mueller to Capitol Hill to testify publicly next month.
After returning from a golf weekend at his resort in Florida on Sunday, Trump has largely been watching TV, speaking with friends and outside advisors by phone, and raging about media reports that continue to fixate on the Mueller report and the rising specter of impeachment.
A Trump campaign advisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that Trump was "mad as hell" about fallout from the Mueller report and "frustrated" that Atty. Gen. William Barr's effort to spin the report's conclusions in a favorable light prior to its actual release last week didn't do more to affect the coverage.
But the media's continued focus on the Mueller report has offered Trump plenty of grist for his efforts to shift from a defensive posture into attack mode.
"The media is so desperate to malign Trump, they can't accept what the people accept: Trump is a deeply flawed man -- but also the disruptor and fighter America needed," the advisor said.
Trump did offer one positive comment Tuesday. He praised his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, after cable TV broadcast parts of an interview Kushner gave at a Time magazine event in New York.
"Great interview by Jared," he tweeted. "Nice to have extraordinarily smart people serving our country!"

Texto completo: A new Netflix comedy follows a grad student with a side gig as a dominatrix. And "Cobra Kai" returns for a second season.
What's Streaming
BONDING Stream on Netflix. "Grad school waits for no dominatrix." That's the last line spoken by Tiff (Zoe Levin) in the first episode of this dark comedy series, but it could also be read as a tagline. The series centers on Tiff, a grad student who works in a sex dungeon to support herself, and Pete (Brendan Scannell), her initially unknowing best friend -- who quickly becomes her knowing business partner. The series was created by the actor Rightor Doyle ("Barry"). Its first episode leans into self-aware and surreal humor.
IT FOLLOWS (2015) Rent on Amazon and iTunes. David Robert Mitchell's "Under the Silver Lake" opened to shaky reviews last week, but high expectations preceded its release: This breakthrough horror feature from Mitchell was received euphorically by many critics when it came out in 2015. Set in a Detroit suburb, the film follows Jay (Maika Monroe), a 19-year-old who is haunted by a curse that is spread by people having sex. "'It Follows' abides by a principle that few horror movies have the courage to embrace: The unknown is the unknown," Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Clues to the source and motives of this menace are dropped, but they don't add up. Like the evil in a David Lynch horror film, it is out there in the night, waiting to get you."
COBRA KAI Stream on YouTube Premium. The "Karate Kid" series got a jump-start when this sequel series debuted last year. The first season rekindled the rivalry introduced in "The Karate Kid" (1984) -- albeit in finely aged form -- with William Zabka reprising his role as the erstwhile bully Johnny Lawrence and Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso, the original movie's protagonist. "It's a karate opera," Hayden Schlossberg, one of the series's creators, told The Times last year. "There's a fun sort of Hatfields and McCoys vibe." The rivalry continues in the second season, which begins Wednesday on YouTube's paid streaming service.
THE SISTERS BROTHERS (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon and Vudu. The French filmmaker Jacques Audiard took on the western genre in this adaptation of a novel by Patrick deWitt. John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix star as brothers and guns-for-hire who connect with a detective played by Jake Gyllenhaal while tracking down a man accused of robbery (Riz Ahmed). He may be innocent.
What's on TV
HIDDEN FIGURES (2016) 8 p.m. on FXX. Janelle Monáe, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer play pioneering black, female mathematicians who did invaluable work for NASA and fought for equality during the 1960s in this biographical drama, which was nominated for three Academy Awards (including best picture). In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the movie "effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters' determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow."

Texto completo: A new drama series tells the true story of a woman who defied norms in 19th-century England. And a documentary about Baltimore is on PBS.
What's on TV
GENTLEMAN JACK 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The title of this new historical series refers to the nickname that residents of Halifax, in northern England, gave Anne Lister, a lesbian landowner, in the 1830s. They called her a gentleman for a number of reasons: She favored black clothes that resembled men's wear, refused to let men take over the business dealings of her estate and openly pursued women. Her life receives an eight-part retelling here, based on her diaries. In the first episode, a heartbroken Lister (Suranne Jones) learns that her lover has become engaged to a man and that her own land is rich in coal. Romantic dramas and business rivalries ensue. "Jones's performance is a marvel, exuding vitality, charisma and sexual confidence," James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The New York Times. "But she also brings Anne empathy, humanity and glimpses of vulnerability that make her more than simply a flawless Regency-era Mary Sue."
THE NEIGHBORHOOD 8 p.m. on CBS. The first season of this family sitcom about black and white neighbors in a gentrifying Los Angeles neighborhood comes to a close. Dave (Max Greenfield) can't stop smiling when Calvin (Cedric the Entertainer) invites him golfing, and Gemma (Beth Behrs) comes up with a plan to impress Grover (Hank Greenspan) after he tells her he's had enough of boring "mom stuff." The show was renewed for a second season, and when Greenfield found out, the news reduced him to tears (according to his 10-year-old daughter, in a recent interview in The Times).
UNDER THE WIRE (2018) 9 p.m. on Starz. Last fall, the war correspondent Marie Colvin became the subject of two films that opened at roughly the same time: "A Private War," a biographical drama starring Rosamund Pike in the leading role, and this chilling documentary by Chris Martin. In 2012, Colvin illegally crossed the border into Syria with the photographer Paul Conroy. Weeks later, she and another reporter were killed in a rocket attack. Here, Conroy revisits those memories with the urge to share Colvin's story -- and the stories of the civilians she was covering.
INDEPENDENT LENS: CHARM CITY (2018) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The director Marilyn Ness shot this documentary about Baltimore (Charm City is one of its nicknames) over three years. In that time, more than 1,000 people were reportedly killed in the city. That rampant violence takes center stage here, as do the people who tirelessly work to stop it. Told in cinéma vérité style, the movie profiles a handful of characters -- police officers, community organizers and a young councilman -- who cling to hope when the odds seem stacked against them.
What's Streaming
PINKY MALINKY Stream on Netflix. The first season of this odd yet entertaining animated series continues. It follows a cheery anthropomorphic hot dog (voiced by Lucas Grabeel) and his human friends in the fictional town of Sackenhack.

Redemption songs

Texto completo: F. SCOTT FITZGERALD famously said, There are no second acts in American lives. But my young, wise friend Sam says something a bit different. He told me a few months back: There are no second chances in our culture today. No repentance. No forgiveness. No chance to start again.

He was talking about celebrities, partly. But this truth seems to apply generally. Except for the Kennedy family and Donald Trump, and maybe a few others who can power through scandal, real or contrived, American society has become the land of one mistake.

That's all you get. Game over.

We have just concluded the Christian season of repentance, culminating in today's celebration of resurrection, hope, and rebirth. And we are in the midst of Passover - the feast of liberation. I wonder if the unforgiving society, the #MeToo society, the gotcha society, the judgment without good or evil society (where hair-smelling is verboten but partial-birth abortion is OK) is obliterating second chances.

Some of us are late bloomers, after all. It takes a while for us to process, to get it.

Some of us are slow learners. Where does no second chances leave us?

There is something to be said for slow learners. They take less for granted. They know gratitude. Wynton Marsalis said of Duke Ellington's compositions that each note was lovingly and meticulously etched. It didn't all just flow through him effortlessly, like Mozart, whose notations where quickly and messily scrawled.

For Ellington the life of the composer came hard. He had to chase the music, which he called an elusive mistress, and fight the bigots and snobs. (He was voted a special Pulitzer citation in 1965, which the Pulitzer board chose not to award - a deeply shameful moment in American cultural life.)

When I was a little boy, age 6 I think, I was in an accident the summer when I was supposed to learn how to swim. My friends learned that summer. I waited for the next summer. Because I was behind, my parents were anxious that I learn fast. So they hired my cousin Mary Joe to teach me. (Mary Joe became a feminist theologian in later life. )

Mary Joe was a great swimmer - a natural. But she was so natural that she did not know how to teach. She had no patience. She lacked empathy.

She also saw the act of swimming as one, unified thing. She could not break it down: You dive or jump in. Then you swim.

Cousin Mary Joe and I did not connect.

But at our pool was a man named Paul Samuell. He was head summer lifeguard, or pool director. I remember him as about 60, he was probably 40. He smoked a pipe, had a deep tan from days upon days in the sun, and taught at the high school in winter months. (I later knew him as adviser to the school newspaper.) Mr. Samuell was the soul of unflappability. Nothing ruffled him. He kept discipline at the poor with calmness.

And Mr. Samuell knew two great truths about teaching: how to be patient and how to break down a challenge - in this case strokes - into separate, small, manageable challenges.

I don't think I ever actually saw Mr. Samuell swim. So I don't know if he was a natural swimmer or not. But I know he was a natural teacher, and he made me a good swimmer. He was smart and he was analytic and he was, in a word, forgiving.

And because swimming came hard and late to me, it meant more than it did to my mates and peers. And I hung on to it.

These days I have a yoga teacher, a young man young enough to be my grandson, who reminds me of Mr. Samuell. He breaks each posture down and, instead of cajoling, coaxes. He is, in a word, forgiving.

I think too of my father teaching me and my sisters to ride a bike. We each got a different teacher. For he understood intuitively that human beings are all wired differently and learn in different ways and at different speeds. And, it's interesting, the one who used training wheels the longest became the most ardent cyclist.

In a tolerant and civilized society, there is more than one way to learn; there are second chances; and there is time and space for forgiveness.

We know this in our bones. We know it, as human beings and as Americans. That's why we love comebacks. Even if Tiger Woods is not your cup of tea, you have to love his comeback.

I had a famous friend once. When The New York Times informed him that his obit was written and filed and waiting upon his departure from this world, he was both outraged and amused. How do they know, he asked me in his 80s, that I won't do something really fine on my last day on Earth?

As is written in Redemption Song: We've got to fulfill the book.

So for all the slow learners and late bloomers comes an Easter message: Second chances are part of the deal.

Or, as a Jewish friend put it to me once: If nothing is forgotten and every experience is used, you have the right to keep trying.

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery/None but ourselves can free our minds.

We need to cut each other some slack in our society and our polity today.

Together, we must sing redemption songs.

Mueller report exposes all the president's liars; ANALYSIS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Vanity Fair runs interview with ex-pastor

Texto completo: Amanda Cowan/Columbian files
Former Vancouver pastor John Bishop, left, arrives Sept. 21, 2018, to be sentenced for unlawful importation of a controlled substance-marijuana at the James M. Carter and Judith N. Keep United States Courthouse in San Diego, Calif.

Disgraced former Living Hope Church pastor John Bishop is once again in the limelight.
The convicted drug-smuggler, who was ousted from the Vancouver church in the fall of 2015, was featured in an April 19 Vanity Fair story called “The Church of Living Dangerously: How One of America's Biggest Pastors Became a Drug Runner for a Mexican Cartel.”
Bishop, 56, was arrested in December 2017 for attempting to smuggle nearly 300 pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico. He later pleaded guilty, and following a number of contentious hearings, was sentenced the day before Thanksgiving to five years in federal prison. He is being housed at the medium security Federal Correctional Institution in Florence, Colo. Bishop is set to be released Dec. 29, 2022.
In 6,015 words, the Vanity Fair writer, David Kushner — who's also written for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, and authored a number of nonfiction books — tells Bishop's life story, including unverified details about his dealings with Mexican drug cartels, as told by Bishop, his wife, Michelle, and their adult son, David.
Bishop gave a similar interview to The Columbian about a week prior, in September, days before the paper published a six-story series on Bishop's fall from grace. The account he gave The Columbian, most of which he requested not be printed, largely diverges from the narrative he and his family shared with Vanity Fair. The magazine did not reference any of The Columbian's reporting.
Bishop's frequently changing story about his drug-running for the New Generation Cartel in Mexico got him into trouble with federal authorities as he approached sentencing.
His plea deal collapsed by September after new evidence showed he repeatedly had been untruthful with prosecutors and the FBI. Bishop was hopeful he'd receive a reduced sentence through a special provision for certain nonviolent drug offenders with little to no criminal history, but instead, he was sentenced to the five-year minimum.
In his interview with Vanity Fair, Bishop said that after he was ousted from Living Hope, he started using heroin and methamphetamine to better understand his son, David, who used and sold drugs. David Bishop, 33, told the magazine that he sold drugs to Living Hope congregants behind the church.
“I definitely took advantage of being a pastor's son. Because he was untouchable I was untouchable,” he told the magazine.
John Bishop said he once had a friend of his son's use a syringe to squirt several drops of heroin into his eyes, according to Vanity Fair.
“I wanted him to know I loved him enough to jump into his life with him. It sounds super weird, but it was the only way,” John Bishop told the magazine.
As the Bishops' lives continued to unravel, father and son said they took a road trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where the Bishops owned a vacation home in a gated community. Along the way, the two used methamphetamine and heroin, they told the magazine.
John Bishop told the magazine that he earned the drug cartel's respect after standing up for his son, who got into trouble selling drugs in Cabo. He eventually became the cartel's “unofficial pastor” and was later asked by a Mexican friend if he would smuggle heroin into the United States. Bishop said he refused.
The same friend, a taxi driver, then offered Bishop work smuggling marijuana. Desperate for money, he agreed.
Bishop said he was introduced to the “big boss,” Pablo, who suggested that if they worked together, they could start a church in Tijuana. The cartel gave him a Volkswagen Passat to ferry marijuana across the border. They practiced making runs across the border, called a “drive dry,” a couple dozen times, “to test his ability to stay cool and see if his trips would arouse any suspicions,” according to Vanity Fair.
Bishop claimed he was a “virtual prisoner of the cartel,” which kept him safe from rival gangs. He said they called him “the asset,” according to the magazine.
Over the course of his drug-running, Bishop apparently made about $50,000. The Bishops reportedly spent the drug money on luxuries, such as a cruise vacation and a trip to a Disney theme park, and shared it with their three adult children, according to court documents.
Prosecutors say Michelle Bishop, 55, knew about her husband's drug-running and helped him by laundering the drug proceeds. They also say that David Bishop held a position with the Mexican cartel. Neither has been charged with a federal crime to date. Michelle Bishop declined to answer Vanity Fair's questions about her alleged involvement.
She told the magazine that she believes her family is under “a spiritual attack.”
“He was such an instrument of God that he had a big target on his back,” she told Vanity Fair of her husband. “We believe that Satan is real, and he's out to destroy our lives.”
Michelle Bishop has ignored The Columbian's interview requests.
John Bishop has filed to appeal his sentence to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The deadline for his appellate brief was in March, but he was granted an extension to May 15. His appellate attorney requested a copy of the sealed transcript from Bishop's sentencing hearing.

Christie Whitman to lead national 'civility' group

Texto completo: For Whitman, Trump's personalized attacks plunged sharp-edged political dialogue to a crude new low.
A deeply alarmed Christie Whitman has tried a variety of ways to stem the rising tide of Trumpism.
The former New Jersey governor made headlines (and videos) calling Trump "unfit" for office and urged him to resign. Whitman, a lifelong Republican, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. And Whitman compared the president — an ex-casino mogul she once clashed with during her tenure as governor in the 1990s — to some of the "worst dictators in history."
Her one-woman resistance hasn't worked.
Now, Whitman has ditched the frontal assault and has embraced a long-range, grassroots approach. Whitman has been named advisory board co-chairwoman of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, an eight-year-old advocacy and training group that seeks to reverse the deepening polarization of the body politic.
Whitman replaces former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement from public life last October. The group's other co-chairman is former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
The institute has a fairly simple overarching plan. It wants political foes to begin treating each other with respect. And with respect comes a tendency to listen, and maybe negotiate along a common ground — a tradition that eroded under the Tea Party fury a decade ago and has all but vanished in Trump era
"You've got to have the conversation and you've got to start listening," Whitman said in a recent interview.
The institute was created shortly after the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. Ironically, days before the shooting, Giffords began discussions about creating a center to advance civil conversation, according to the NICD's website.
The group's mission of restoring civility at the grassroots level of politics was spawned by an across-the-aisle concern that echo-chamber partisanship is destroying the art of compromise, and hence the very underpinnings of democracy. Partisan voters took their cues from the loudest demagogues, who drown out the demands of the nation's vast middle of independents and moderates.
Attacks on lawmakers — the Giffords shooting, the shooting of House Republican leader Steve Scalise, the 2001 anthrax mailings to political figures, including Daschle — also stirred worries that a breakdown in civil discourse was giving way to extremism.
Trump's election, fueled largely by a mobilized right-wing base, has brought all of those worries to a boil.
Unlike other newly elected presidents, Trump refused to broaden his agenda and his appeal beyond his hard-line, white nationalist supporters, who view compromise as weakness, even betrayal.
And for Whitman, Trump's personalized attacks plunged sharp-edged political dialogue to a crude new low. She singled out Trump's mocking of a New York Times reporter with disabilities during the 2016 campaign.
"This isn't who we are," Whitman lamented.
Keith Allred, the institute's executive director, said Trump's style helped crystallize the long-brewing concerns about polarization and decline in civility.
"There are deeper, systemic things that are going on that will be with us long after Trump," he said in an interview.
"But he has put such a kind of extreme and vivid face on the problem that I think he has gotten people to wake up to it and focus on it."
The institute doesn't simply broadcast a clarion call for civility through its network of prominent political and media figures — the NICD's board ranges from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright to NPR host Scott Simon and Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric.
The organization conducts a series of workshops in schools, community groups and, perhaps most importantly, legislatures, which have traditionally served as the de facto training ground for future members of Congress. Half of New Jersey's House delegation, for example, are former state legislators.
The group's "Building Trust through Civil Discourse" workshop has been held in 16 states, is a half-day attempt to prod officials to reconsider each other on common ground. Participants are prodded to craft "rules of engagement" for the discussion, which effectively serves as a manifesto of civility — no talking past each other, a ban on disparaging each other, and a commitment to "listen first."
They are asked to explain, "not in a canned campaign speech," about what brought them into politics, Allred said. They then explain why they love their home state.
From there they break out in groups and make recommendations.
In Maine, lawmakers agreed to alternate legislative seating between Democrats and Republicans rather than have the parties segregated, as is commonly done. The effort has led to more bipartisan legislation, increased dialogue across the aisle, significant procedural changes, and legislators holding civil conversations with their constituents, the NICD contends.
"They start seeing fellow legislators as human beings," he said. More than 850 lawmakers have participated in the workshops.
With the power of party bosses and county chairmen in New Jersey's politics, high-minded workshops might seem like a waste of time. This is also a state that produced Chris Christie, a smash-mouth politician known for his name-calling skills, and who happens to be Trump's chief defender in New Jersey.
Just last week, the former governor broke his vow of silence and unleashed a Trumpian attack on his successor, Democrat Phil Murphy, at a hunters' event last Sunday, mocking his manner of speech and asserting that Murphy is "not from here," a reference to Murphy's Massachusetts upbringing.
Yet New Jersey has a long tradition of transactional politics, which has led lawmakers to abandon their partisan loyalties in pursuit of a good deal. And that "deal" often includes a hefty price tag.
For Whitman and the NICD, the campaign is less about the outbursts of the moment and more about the conduct of the future. Allred noted confidently that the nation has gone through deep, seemingly unbridgeable divides in the nation's history, only to rebound when the public realizes that things have reached a crisis stage.
Ironically, Trump's conduct has helped the group make its case.
"You've got to start somewhere," Whitman said.

Texto completo: BY DAVID BAUDER
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - The release of a dense, 400-page report on the results of a two-year investigation is an event uniquely unsuited to today's minute-by-minute news cycles.
That was the challenge faced Thursday by journalists who finally got to see special counsel Robert Mueller's findings on the Russia investigation, after another attempt by President Donald Trump and his administration to give their version of what it said.
Reporters scrambled through stacks of paper with blacked-out portions to glean highlights. Cameras peeked over shoulders to display Mueller's words on computer screens. Anchors continually asked colleagues, "What have you found?" or "What jumps out at you?"
"We're all going to law school today," NBC's Savannah Guthrie said.
Mueller's report was released shortly after 11a.m., following Attorney General William Barr's more detailed verbal summary of the written summary he delivered on March 24. That succeeded in setting a Trump-friendly narrative of the investigation. Barr repeated Thursday that Mueller had found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians trying to influence the 2016 election, an assessment broadcast live on broadcast and cable news networks.
In a short news conference that followed, Barr three times batted away questions about whether he was doing Trump's bidding in summarizing Mueller's words before the public could see them.
"I was struck with how much he put his own credibility on the line, it seemed, in order to spin for the press and give the president basically what amounts to two hours of better press," ABC News' Matthew Dowd said.
NBC analyst Chuck Rosenberg said Barr "went too far into the tank" for Trump.
"Book reviews are interesting," he said. "But the book is always more telling."
Once the report was released, the networks largely ignored - or showed in delayed, truncated form - a Trump White House appearance where he commented on the findings.
Journalists were warned in advance to slow down and take time to digest the news before talking about it or interviewing opinionated guests. But that ignores a hyper-competitive world with airtime and web pages to fill and consumers who are never more than a click away from rivals. A smiling Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, was on Fox News Channel within a half hour of the report's release.
Certain highlights were emphasized, like the president's profanity when he learned of Mueller's appointment, and former White House counsel Don McGahn's refusal to order Mueller's firing.
The report's sheer length made varied conclusions inevitable, even within the same news organization.
"The way Barr described what he called the top line or bottom line conclusions of the Mueller investigation tracks very closely with what I've been able to read," NBC News' Pete Williams said. "His summary of what the investigation says is pretty much on point."
Later, Brian Williams asked an MSNBC guest, former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, "What report do you think the attorney general was describing this morning?"
"Not the one that I'm reading now," she replied.
Television networks used chyrons to flag findings: "Trump to Sessions Upon Recusal: 'You Were Supposed to Protect Me'" on MSNBC. "Trump Engaged in Effort to Encourage Witnesses not to Cooperate with Investigation" on Fox News.
On YouTube, Vice News showed a reporter, sitting at a table with a framed picture of Mueller under a potted plant, reading the document.
The Washington Post led its first post-release story by describing how Mueller's investigators "struggled with both the legal implications of investigating President Trump for possible obstruction of justice, and the motives behind a range of his most alarming actions, from seeking the ouster of former officials to ordering a memo that would clear his name."
On its web site, The New York Times kept up a running series of brief dispatches from individual reporters on highlights of the report.
The Associated Press did both, sending out individual alerts of report findings and leading its first post-release story with the news of McGahn's refusal to get Mueller fired.
Fox News anchor Bret Baier mused about what point Mueller had concluded that there was no collusion with Russia. If that news had gotten out earlier, would it have changed the results of the 2018 midterm elections?
"You've had for 23 months the sword of Damocles hanging over the Trump campaign and the Trump administration that is eating away at the body politic," he said.
Several reporters noted how the report outlined the president's ease at lying or directing his underlings not to tell the truth. "Stories that we were told were not true, Robert Mueller said were true," said ABC's Cecilia Vega. "It's right here, in black and white."
CNN's Jake Tapper noted that "it's not a crime to the lie to the public. It's not a crime to lie to reporters."
"Which is lucky for the White House," Anderson Cooper replied, "because they do it all the time."

Heisler: Lakers sticking with family, but Kobe Bryant won’t be riding to the rescue

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

Texto completo: Un grupo de milicias armadas de derecha operando a lo largo de la frontera sur detuvo a un grupo de 200 inmigrantes que buscaban asilo y los amenzó con armas de fuego hasta que llegaron los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza.
Esta milicia armada, que se llama a sí mismo Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos , dijo que está decidido a monitorear la frontera hasta que el Presidente Donald Trump cumpla su promesa de campaña de un muro fronterizo o hasta que el Congreso promulgue una legislación más fuerte para hacer más difícil que los inmigrantes soliciten asilo, dijo Jim Benvie portavoz del grupo en entrevista con el New York Times.
Al conocer sobre los hechos la gobernadora de Nuevo México, Michelle Lujan Grisham, en una declaración al diario neoyorquino dijo que es “completamente inaceptable” que los inmigrantes sean “Amenazados” al ingresar a los Estados Unidos por este tipo de grupos.
La Unión Americana de Libertades civiles ACLU aseguró en una declaración que “el racismo vil de la administración Trump” es lo que le da alas a este tipo de grupos radicales.
Por su parte la Patrulla Fronteriza a través de su portavoz, Carlos A. Díaz, dijo en una declaración que la CBP “no respalda a grupos privados u organizaciones que tomen asuntos de cumplimiento en sus propias manos “.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Mueller said in his report that he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed a crime or that he hadn’t. The following are the 10 instances.
Pressure on Comey
to end Flynn probe
This includes the president’s statement to then-FBI Director James Comey regarding the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way to letting this go.”
President’s reaction
to continuing probe
Among the evidence is the president telling then-White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation and Trump’s subsequent anger at Sessions. Trump also contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders to ask them to push back publicly on the suggestion that Trump had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
Firing of Comey
and aftermath
Mueller’s report says “substantial evidence” indicates Trump’s decision to fire Comey in May 2017 was the result of the FBI director’s unwillingness to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation. On the day after Trump fired Comey, the president told Russian officials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
Appointment of special counsel, removal efforts
Trump reacted to news of Mueller’s appointment by telling advisers it was “the end of his presidency.” The president told aides Mueller had conflicts of interest and should have to step aside. His aides told Trump the asserted conflicts were meritless. Following media reports that Mueller’s team was investigating whether the president had obstructed justice, Trump called then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and directed him to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused.
Further efforts
to curtail probe
Trump instructed former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to have Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the president, the president had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with Mueller to limit him to “investigating election meddling for future elections.”
Efforts to prevent
public disclosure
In summer of 2017, Trump learned the news media planned to report on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and Russians offering derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. The president directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the meeting. Before the emails became public, the president also edited a press statement for Donald Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was “with an individual who (Trump Jr.) was told might have information helpful to the campaign.”
Efforts to have
Sessions take control
At several points in between July 2017 and December 2017, Trump tried to get Sessions to declare he was no longer recused from the Russia investigation and would assert control over it. The report says there’s evidence that one purpose of asking Sessions to step in was so that the attorney general would restrict the investigation’s scope.
Trump orders McGahn to deny firing attempt
In an Oval Office meeting in February 2018, Trump told McGahn to “correct” a New York Times story that reported Trump had earlier instructed McGahn to fire Mueller. Trump also asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s investigators about the directive to remove Mueller. McGahn told Trump he had to tell the investigators the truth.
Trump’s actions toward Flynn, Manafort
Mueller looked at whether Trump’s sympathetic messages to Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and others were intended to limit their cooperation with Mueller’s investigation.
Trump actions
toward Cohen
Mueller noted that Trump’s conduct toward Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise to castigation after Cohen began cooperating with prosecutors. The evidence could “support an inference that the president used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter” cooperation and undermine Cohen’s credibility, Mueller wrote.

Texto completo: Poignant stories of violence and loss, perseverance and hope are depicted in photographer James A. Bowey’s exhibit "When Home Won’t Let You Stay," on display until Sunday, May 26, at the Schaumburg Township Library, 130 S. Roselle Road, Schaumburg. The exhibit is on the library’s second floor.
As Bowey, a documentary artist, traveled throughout Minnesota in an exploration of America’s evolving attitudes toward refugees, he listened to refugees’ stories and photographed them in their everyday surroundings.
Each was forced to leave their country in order to survive. The experiences shared by the refugees featured in "When Home Won’t Let You Stay" produce a compelling human portrait of refugees in Minnesota.
"One of the most difficult things a person ever does is to truly see another," Bowey said in his artist statement. "But if we really look at someone and consider their story, we discover the shared humanity that links us all. That is the hope for this work: to find ourselves in each other, one photograph at a time."
Bowey uses his documentary and photography skills to explore issues of human rights and social connection. He has spent his career covering a wide range of global and national stories, from the war in Bosnia to Hurricane Katrina. His photography and writing has been featured in The New York Times, Time magazine, The Associated Press, and in numerous exhibitions.

Takeaways From the Report: No Crime, but a Trail of Lies And Suspicious Interactions

Texto completo: The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, produced a report of more than 400 pages that painted a deeply unflattering picture of President Trump but stopped short of accusing him of criminal wrongdoing. Here are seven takeaways.
Trump did try to sabotage the investigation. His staff defied him.
When Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Mr. Trump that a special counsel had been appointed in May 2017, Mr. Trump grew angry: "I'm fucked," he said, believing his presidency was ruined. He told Mr. Sessions, "This is the worst thing that ever happened to me."
Mr. Trump began trying to get rid of Mr. Mueller, only to be thwarted by his staff. In instance after instance, his staff acted as a bulwark against Mr. Trump's most destructive impulses. In June 2017, the president instructed Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to remove Mr. Mueller. Mr. McGahn resisted, and decided he would rather resign.
Two days later, Mr. Trump asked another adviser, Corey Lewandowski, to tell Mr. Sessions to end the investigation. Mr. Lewandowski did not want to, so he punted to a colleague, Rick Dearborn. He, too, "was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through."
Mr. Trump was angry that Mr. Sessions recused himself from the investigation. (Vol. II, Page 78)
So many lies. So many changed stories.
One of the unanswered questions of the past two years -- which helped fuel the F.B.I. investigation, congressional inquiries and journalistic scrutiny -- is why so many people lied, changed their stories and issued misleading statements to both the public and authorities.
The report recaps one false statement after another. Just a few examples:
Mr. Trump was livid when journalists revealed that he had unsuccessfully ordered Mr. Mueller's firing. The president tried to get Mr. McGahn to say publicly that was false, but Mr. McGahn refused, saying that the news reports were accurate. Mr. Mueller's report notably declared that Mr. McGahn was "credible."
Mr. Trump also pressed the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to give a news conference about the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. The White House press office wanted Mr. Rosenstein to say it was his idea. He told the president that a news conference was a bad idea "because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth."
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, admitted issuing a statement to the news media "in the heat of the moment that was not founded on anything."
No, F.B.I. agents didn't actually call the White House offering support for Mr. Comey's firing. (Vol. II, Page 72)
Mr. Mueller can't explain why the stories about Mr. Comey's firing keep changing. (Vol. II, Page 77)
______
Fake news? Not so much.
The president has spent the past two years denouncing the news media. He has repeatedly accused reporters of making up sources to destroy his presidency. The report, though, shows not only that some of the most unflattering stories about Mr. Trump were accurate, but also that White House officials knew that was the case even as they heaped criticism on journalists.
In May 2017, for instance, The New York Times disclosed that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.'s investigation into the president's national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Trump tweeted, "I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!"
"Despite those denials," Mr. Mueller wrote, "substantial evidence corroborates Comey's account."
In another instance, Mr. Trump appeared to use criticism of the news media as a legal strategy. He attacked a Times article suggesting that his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, might cooperate with the Justice Department and provide information about Mr. Trump.
That tweet coincided with outreach to Mr. Cohen by Mr. Trump's associates, and Mr. Cohen understood that this was all part of an effort to get him to "stay on message and be part of the team."
The president accused the "dishonest media" of making up stories that turned out to be true. (Vol. II, Page 147)
______
No obstruction? Not so fast.
Mr. Trump was quick to declare the report a total vindication.
But federal authorities went out of their way not to exonerate Mr. Trump. They wrote that his conduct in office "presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred."
If the evidence cleared the president, Mr. Mueller would have said so. It didn't. (Vol. II, Page 8)
______
Evading an F.B.I. interview proved a successful strategy.
Mr. Trump repeatedly said he was eager to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller's team, despite his lawyers' insistence that it was a terrible idea.
The report makes clear why his lawyers were so worried about it. Mr. Mueller had a huge cache of unanswered questions, misleading and conflicting statements, and unexplained actions with which to confront the president. Sitting for an interview, the report makes clear, would have exposed Mr. Trump to far more problems.
Mr. Mueller said he chose not to subpoena the president because a court fight would delay the investigation. But that decision meant that the authorities were never able to ask the central question in the obstruction case: What was Mr. Trump thinking when he tried repeatedly to undermine the investigation?
Mr. Mueller believed he had the authority to subpoena the president. (Vol. II, Page 13)
______
No evidence of conspiracy, but lots of reason to investigate.
Mr. Mueller makes explicit what Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on: Russia secretly manipulated the 2016 presidential election.
The investigation ultimately found no evidence that anyone from Mr. Trump's campaign participated in that effort, but the report reveals in stark detail the many suspicious interactions that had the F.B.I. so worried. Many of those have been reported, but the report amounts to a compendium that helps explain the origins of the F.B.I. investigation, known as "Crossfire Hurricane."
For instance, it has long been known that George Papadopoulos, a young campaign aide, was told that the Russian government had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. But the report goes much further, revealing that Mr. Papadopoulos suggested an explicit offer by the Russian government to work with the Trump campaign to sabotage Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Papadopoulos indicated that Russia wanted to coordinate with the Trump campaign. (Vol. I, Page 89)
______
Reading this report cold.
Prosecutors describe a president who was preoccupied with ending a federal investigation, a White House that told misleading and changing stories, and a presidential campaign that was in repeated contact with Russian officials for reasons that are not always clear.
Even though prosecutors concluded that didn't amount to provably criminal conduct, the report is astounding in its sweep. It is also a reminder of how much the public has learned over the past two years about Mr. Trump's conduct.
If the public or members of Congress were learning these things for the first time, the political fallout would normally be devastating. The consequences of the report remain to be seen, but if people are not surprised or shocked by the revelations, then Mr. Trump may have benefited by the steady drip of news stories he has so loudly criticized.
The special counsel suggests a pattern of behavior by Mr. Trump to harm the investigation. (Vol. II, Page 157)

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 400-page report today, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Donald Trump was suspected of obstructing justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report — the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on — will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump’s intent and some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed account of his alleged conduct — analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller’s inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William Barr plans to hold an 8:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. (CDT), the official said, and will be posted on the special counsel’s website thereafter.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter’s supreme sensitivity.
Today’s rollout plan — and news of the White House’s advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and The New York Times — led to political uproar Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.
"This is wrong," Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter.
While the report’s light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump’s lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department’s talks with the White House — which could help Trump and his attorneys hone their attacks on the report in advance.
Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he is preparing a counterreport to Mueller’s findings, and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president’s viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller’s findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything Mueller found on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter of the special counsel’s conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s attorneys, told The Washington Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report’s redactions or Mueller’s findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance, which was confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller’s report. Today’s news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics — and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller’s findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told the Larry O’Connor show on WMAL that he was pondering having his own news conference.
"You’ll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that; we’ll see," Trump said.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller’s report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller’s team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information he has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller’s investigation.
Since the special counsel’s office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Any redactions could be controversial, and Democrats have said they won’t be satisfied unless they are given the entire, unfiltered document. It is likely House Democrats will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller’s "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
Barr offered only a few quotes from Mueller’s report, leaving a curious public with many more questions than answers about what his 22-month investigation had found.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the most controversial incidents, from the firing of James Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Texto completo: After 17,216 performances, 6.5 million visitors, and who-knows-how-many gargantuan hats, San Francisco's enduring "Beach Blanket Babylon" is ending its run.
The zany spoof show, which has been running since 1974 and claims to be the longest-running musical revue in the world, will play its final performances on New Year's Eve, the producer announced on Wednesday.
"I just felt it was time -- after 45 years, it was the right time to close," said the producer, Jo Schuman Silver. "It's better for us to go out on top than to drag this out."
The pun-and-sight-gag-filled show has a feather-thin plot -- Snow White, looking for love, wanders the world encountering famous people who sing pop song parodies, often about politics and celebrity. It has become a treasured San Francisco staple, renowned as much for its spectacularly sculptural headgear as its content. (A San Francisco skyline hat is 14 feet high, nine feet wide and weighs more than 250 pounds.) It has been performed for a parade of notables, from Liza Minnelli to Queen Elizabeth II.
"If 'Seinfeld' was about nothing, this is about everything," Michael Janofsky wrote in The New York Times in 1998, "a wild musical homage to popular culture that has become no less a part of San Francisco than the Golden Gate Bridge, the Coit Tower and fog."
The show, which for years has been staged at Club Fugazi in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, was created by Steve Silver, and is constantly updated. Mr. Silver died of AIDS in 1995; Ms. Silver is his widow.

Democrats blast Barr press conference on Mueller report, request special counsel testimony

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Senior Democrats requested Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller appear before Congress to testify on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
"It is clear Congress and the American people must hear from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in person to better understand his findings," Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter following a press conference by Attorney General William Barr. Nadler requested Mueller appear no later than May 23.
Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff also "formally invited" Mueller to appear before his panel to discuss the investigation, sometime next month.
Mueller's long-awaited report came out Thursday morning.
Democrats have been in an uproar over Barr's decision to hold a press briefing prior to the public release of Mueller's report, saying it would have been better for him to take questions once the public and lawmakers have a chance to see the document for themselves.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Barr's press conference a "campaign press conference" for the president.
For weeks, House Democrats have criticized Barr's handling of the report but those critiques have intensified hours before the Justice Department is set to release a redacted version of the 400-page document to the public.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , and Schumer, D-N. Y. , condemned what they said was "Barr’s regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report. "
"We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the Special Counsel’s investigation is for Special Counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible," the statement said. "The American people deserve to hear the truth. ”
The House Democratic committee chairmen also voiced frustration with Barr.
"Once again, Barr wants to shape the public's perception of the report," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , wrote on Twitter. "This is not justice. Just PR. "
In a joint statement, Democratic House chairs called Barr's news conference "unnecessary and inappropriate" and called for release of the full report.
“These new actions by the Attorney General reinforce our concern that he is acting to protect President Trump," the statement said.
More: AG William Barr to hold news conference Thursday on before Mueller report goes to Congress
Nadler said the idea to release the report after Barr's news conference was ill-advised. "This is wrong," he wrote in a tweet. He continued, saying he was "deeply troubled" by the Times report about contact between the Justice Department and the White House before the report was released.
Nadler, D-N. Y. , along with four House Democrats, held a last-minute news conference in New York Wednesday to discuss both Barr's delayed release of the report and his handling of the probe as a whole.
"The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump, the very subject of the investigation at the heart of the Mueller report," Nadler said. "Rather than letting the facts of the report speak for themselves, the attorney general has taken unprecedented steps to spin Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation. "
Alongside Nadler was Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N. Y. , who tweeted that Barr's handling of the report equated to a "dog and pony show" and urged Barr to "keep your mouth shut. "
"So-called Attorney General is presiding over a dog and pony show. Here is a thought. Release the Mueller report tomorrow morning and keep your mouth shut," Jeffries said. "You have ZERO credibility. "
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , also questioned Barr's intentions.
"Why is William Barr holding a press conference if not to (once again) try and frame the Special Counsel’s findings," he wrote on Twitter. "Just release the full report and let the American people judge for themselves!"
On Twitter, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, lashed out at Nadler while defending Barr's handling of the report.
"The only person trying to spin the report is @RepJerryNadler," Collins tweeted. "The AG has done nothing unilaterally. After partnering with DAG Rosenstein to share principal conclusions, Barr is releasing the report voluntarily, working with Mueller’s team step by step. "
A Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found 60% of Americans want to see Congress get full access to the Mueller report, while only 30% said the Justice Department should be able to redact information deemed sensitive.
Still, a majority of Americans polled, 54%, said Congress should move on to other issues after the report's release. Just 39% said Congress should continue to look into topics related to the report.
Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who worked on Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, predicted that Democrats would "light their hair on fire" over the redactions but said that would likely backfire politically.
"Critics of the president will look at any black spot on this report and jump to the absolute worst conclusion," she said.
She acknowledged the full report likely won't all be positive. However, she said Trump and the administration will be cleared and the country should move on.
"Certainly there will be things in the report that the administration would rather not be made public, but that doesn’t mean it's illegal or concerning moving forward," she said.
Tyler Law, a Democratic strategist who worked for the House Democrats' campaign arm during the 2018 election, said oversight was part of Congress' job and the party took back the House by promising to be a check on Trump.
Law said Democrats can both conduct oversight and deliver on issues voters care about.
"This is similar to the 2018 midterms. Democrats are remaining focused on the issues that we know are going to drive voters, health care and the economy. What people don’t want is a candidate who is focused exclusively on the president," he said.
Law dismissed the idea that Democrats could overplay their hand.
"People are not stupid. They understand that this is President Trump's scandal and every time it’s brought up it hurts him," he said.

Clippers hope to avoid having to mount staggering comebacks vs. Warriors

Texto completo: PLAYA VISTA — You’ve just set an NBA record for biggest postseason comeback in NBA history – what are you going to do next?
Settle in for a critical film session, naturally.
“We came back and what we did was historic, but the reality tells a whole different story,” said Coach Doc Rivers, whose team’s epic comeback evened their first-round Western Conference playoff series with the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors at 1-1. Game 3 is Thursday night at Staples Center.
“The reality is that we were down 31, and the reality is we’re not going to win a lot of games against anybody doing that. The reality is they’re shooting over 50 percent and there’s a lot of realities in this series that don’t bode well unless we do something about it.”
The reality, Rivers stressed before (and likely at) Wednesday’s practice: “We have to play better. We understand we won the game, but we’re not going to win the game playing that way. I think we fully understand that. If not, we’re about to when we watch film.”
Yes, the Clippers outscored Golden State 72-37 – the best offensive 19 minutes of not just the season, but “of their lives,” Rivers said – down the stretch to win Game 2. But prior to the 7:31 mark of the third quarter on Monday, they were being outscored 215-167 in the series.
“I mean, 131 points (total),” said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley, whose job it has been to harass Kevin Durant. “Ain’t nobody really playing no defense, but we were fortunate to get stops when they mattered, to get loose balls when they mattered.”
They had squandered opportunities in Game 1 – which was encouraging, insisted the Clippers, who were pleased to have had chances. And it was true: Before the turnaround began in the third quarter, the Clippers had forced 28 turnovers. The problem was that they’d turned them into only 23 points. (Conversely, they’d coughed it up 27 times themselves, miscues the Warriors converted to 34 points).
Except for the production of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell off the bench, the Clippers hadn’t been nearly aggressive enough for Rivers’ liking – especially because against the Warriors, offense might be the best defense.
“We’ve just got to be more in sync offensively,” Clippers guard Landry Shamet said Wednesday. “I know they scored 70 points in the first half, but offensively, I think that made a big difference (in the comeback). We were more in sync, making plays for each other, on the same page. Our flow was a whole lot better in the second half.”
In the final 24 minutes, the Clippers’ offensive assertiveness and togetherness was rewarded: They went 17 for 19 from the free-throw line (to which they made seven more trips than in the opening half), and they shot 30 for 45 from the field, including 8 for 14 from 3-point range.
And as the Clippers – the biggest first-round underdogs in 30 years, at 100-1 – rallied from a statistical 0.1 percent probability of winning with 8:30 on the clock Monday, the nation took notice, either that night as it happened or waking up to the stunning result the next morning.
USA Today proclaimed the Clippers “the best thing to happen to the NBA playoffs,” the New York Times profiled Lou Williams (whose 36 points and 11 assists in the game were more than any other reserve in a postseason game since 1985), and ESPN invited Landry Shamet to share his reliable insight on “The Jump.”
“It’s been good,” Shamet said Wednesday of the attention, but he quickly added, “at the end of the day we’re 1-1 right now. By no means are we satisfied or feel like we’ve accomplished anything in its entirety, at least.
“It’s a good feat to come from behind and tie the series, but me personally, I’m trying to move past all that because we know we probably just (irritated) a sleeping bear. They’re going to be ready to go tomorrow.”
“I don’t care,” about the bear, Rivers said. “Because we have to have an extra something.”
And then, with his players taking their seats on folding chairs in a semi-circle around a television monitor, Rivers went to show them how.

Justice Dept. Continued to Investigate WikiLeaks After Secretly Indicting Assange

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department continued to investigate WikiLeaks last year even after the secret indictment of its founder, Julian Assange, seeking to question at least two of the antisecrecy organization's volunteers about their activities, according to interviews and a letter obtained by The New York Times.
One day after prosecutors charged Mr. Assange with a single count of conspiracy to unlawfully hack into a computer, the Justice Department asked Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks activist, if it could question him about the possibility that he violated American laws prohibiting "the receipt and dissemination of secret information." The language, in a letter to him in his native German, suggested that prosecutors had not, at least at that point, abandoned the possibility of charges based on WikiLeaks' publication of United States government secrets.
Prosecutors last summer also sought out David M. House, a former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked as a volunteer for WikiLeaks from 2009 to 2013.
Mr. House spoke for about 90 minutes to prosecutors and also testified at length to the grand jury, according to a person who has spoken with prosecutors and agreed to an interview on the condition of anonymity. They pressed him for information about debates inside WikiLeaks over whether to redact from government documents posted online the names of vulnerable people, such as foreign citizens who worked confidentially with American military officers or diplomats, to protect them from harm.
The communications with Mr. Berg and Mr. House show that even after Mr. Assange was indicted on accusations of computer hacking, the United States government was eager to build a case against a WikiLeaks associate for disseminating state secrets -- a charge that spoke directly to the group's main enterprise, but would also thrust the Justice Department into a thorny fight over First Amendment rights and galvanize supporters of WikiLeaks and of the free press.
They also show that prosecutors were focused mainly on work done by WikiLeaks in 2010, when Mr. Assange received classified and secret information from Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and American diplomacy overseas.
Mr. Assange worked with reporters at publications including The New York Times, The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish that information. Eric H. Holder Jr., then the attorney general, announced a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks.
Justice Department officials under the Obama administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Mr. Assange for sharing information because it risked setting a precedent that could erode press freedoms for news organizations that also publish classified information.
But prosecutors in Northern Virginia continued to explore ways to crack down on WikiLeaks.
The letter to Mr. Berg, dated March 7, 2018 -- one day after Mr. Assange was secretly indicted -- was sent by Tracy Doherty-McCormick, a cybercrime and national security specialist who worked on the Assange case while she was a federal prosecutor in Virginia under the Obama administration. She was also the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia when Mr. Assange was indicted.
Ms. Doherty-McCormick wrote that the interview would be voluntary, and it was unclear whether Mr. Berg ultimately spoke with prosecutors. The German publication Die Zeit first reported the case against Mr. Berg.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to say whether the government had dropped its case against Mr. Berg or whether there were any sealed charges against him or any other WikiLeaks associates.
In his interviews with prosecutors and the grand jury, Mr. House denied any role in the leak of the documents from Ms. Manning to WikiLeaks, the person said. Mr. House's interview with prosecutors and grand jury testimony were first reported by The Daily Beast.
He was asked about online chats among WikiLeaks workers that investigators had obtained and was questioned about discussions inside the group about when to redact names from documents posted on the internet.
The question of redactions became a point of contention in 2010, after human rights groups criticized WikiLeaks for exposing the names of Afghan citizens who had assisted the United States and might be subject to retaliation. The group subsequently stripped names from many documents but remained inconsistent in its practices.
It is unclear whether investigators were considering whether endangering people named in the government documents by posting them online might violate a criminal statute.
Mr. Assange was ultimately accused of unsuccessfully helping Ms. Manning try to log onto a classified military network by breaking a passcode and using another person's identity. He was charged with a single computer hacking offense.
The indictment against Mr. Assange did not include any charge related to the receipt or publication of secret information, but he was accused of hacking into a government computer system "in furtherance of a criminal act" that violated laws against obtaining material to harm the United States or to aid a foreign power.
Nor did the indictment mention the 2016 election or Mr. Assange's decision to post to WikiLeaks troves of Democratic emails stolen by Russian government hackers.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, secured an indictment against 12 Russian military officers in the thefts, describing them as part of the Kremlin's campaign to undermine the American electoral process and help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians used online personas including Guccifer 2.0 to work with people and organizations in a position to spread the information, including WikiLeaks, according to the indictment.
WikiLeaks' publication of the stolen Democratic emails may have been omitted from Mr. Assange's indictment in part because mention of the election could cast the Justice Department's charges against Mr. Assange in a more political light, legal experts said, and harm the administration's chances of extraditing him from Britain to stand trial in the United States.

Texto completo: Stanford University has cleared Stephen Quake, a bioengineering professor, of any wrongdoing in his interactions with a Chinese researcher who roiled the scientific world by creating the first gene-edited babies.
"In evaluating evidence and witness statements, we found that Quake observed proper scientific protocol," said a letter from the university to Dr. Quake, obtained by The New York Times on Tuesday.
Referring to the Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, by his nickname, JK, the letter said that Stanford's investigators concluded that Dr. Quake did not "directly participate in any way in JK's research, including in the conception or performance of the work."
In fact, the letter said, Dr. Quake discouraged Dr. He from pursuing the project and urged him to follow proper scientific practices after he insisted on going ahead.
Dr. Quake was one of three professors whose interactions with Dr. He were being reviewed by Stanford, and his association with Dr. He was the most extensive. The other two -- Dr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher, and Dr. William Hurlbut, an ethicist -- had previously said they strongly discouraged Dr. He when he told them of his idea to create genetically engineered babies.
In a statement Tuesday, Stanford, which has never publicly named the professors under review, said that it had exonerated all of them.
"Based on all of the available information, the reviewers found that the Stanford researchers were not participants in Dr. He's research regarding genome editing of human embryos for intended implantation and birth, and that they had no research, financial or organizational ties to this research," the statement said. "The review found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to Dr. He about his work."
Since Dr. He announced the birth of the gene-edited twins in November, the research community has been debating what actions scientists should take if they know about ethically questionable experiments. Global institutions, including the World Health Organization, are working to establish an international reporting and monitoring system.
Dr. Quake's interactions with Dr. He were detailed in a recent New York Times article, which included excerpts from emails that Dr. Quake showed to a Times reporter.
The emails show that Dr. He, 35, who had been a postdoctoral student in Dr. Quake's lab in 2011, kept Dr. Quake apprised of major steps, including the implantation of the edited embryos in the woman's womb and the birth of the twins months later. They show that Dr. Quake suggested that Dr. He obtain ethical approval from Chinese institutions and submit the project's data for vetting by peer-reviewed journals.
The emails contain encouraging expressions like "Wow, that's quite an achievement!" But the correspondence makes it clear that Dr. Quake did not participate in the work itself.
On Tuesday, Dr. Quake, who turned 50 this week, said: "I'm pleased this inquiry is over and its conclusion is consistent with what I knew to be true: that I had urged Dr. He not to pursue this path and when it became clear he wouldn't listen to me, to adhere to high scientific and ethical standards in his research."
Dr. Quake, an entrepreneur whose inventions include blood tests to detect Down syndrome in pregnancy and to avoid organ transplant rejection, is also co-president of an institute funded by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.
The investigation of Dr. Quake began after the president of Dr. He's Chinese university wrote letters alleging that Dr. Quake had helped with the project.
The letters, obtained by The Times, claimed that "Prof. Stephen Quake provided instructions to the preparation and implementation of the experiment, the publication of papers, the promotion and news release, and the strategies to react after the news release."
The Chinese government, in a preliminary report in January, concluded that Dr. He forged ethical review documents and engaged in actions that "seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations."

Brazil is changing. Caetano Veloso is forever.

Texto completo: When Caetano Veloso sings, it sounds more powerful than reality, but he knows it's real. For all of the whimsy, beatitude and hallucinogenic sensuality in his music, the colossal Brazilian songwriter has always been an artful pragmatist, a devout atheist and an unwavering skeptic of the hippie-dipped mysticism that fogged the dawn of his recording career way back in 1967. It's made him unsolvable and eternal. We'll never be able to touch the music falling from Veloso's lips, but we can still believe in it.
Now, Veloso is 76 years old, which puts him more than 50 years past the invention of tropicalia, a worldly dialect of pop that, once upon a time, opposed Brazil's brutal military dictatorship with style and courage. In Veloso's poetic 1997 memoir, "Tropical Truth," he describes tropicalia as a music "made of happenstance and misunderstandings" designed to "destroy the Brazil of the nationalists." And with that specific goal in mind, Veloso and his fellow tropicalistas absorbed influences from near and far - the proud sophistication of bossa nova, the melodic idealism of the Beatles, the clever cool of Andy Warhol and more.
But if there's a central life force residing in the heart of tropicalia - then, now or tomorrow - it's the music's radical, radiant optimism. For Veloso, making music in the late '60s was "the right to imagine an ambitious intervention in the future of the world, a right that immediately begins to be lived as duty."
And the future is here (at least for now). Brazil has elected a far-right president and Veloso is touring the planet again, accompanied by his sons, Moreno, Zeca and Tom, three young vocalists who have clearly inherited their father's sly, devastating tenderness. Performing at the Music Center at Strathmore in North Bethesda, Md., on Monday evening, the smiling patriarch described the concert as a "celebration of reproduction" - a good joke that could also be applied to the eternal springiness of hope itself.
Veloso knows plenty about propagating optimism in heavy times. Tropicalia was in full bloom in December 1969 when Veloso and his songwriting comrade, Gilberto Gil, were arrested without explanation, imprisoned for months, later put on house arrest and eventually exiled to London. They returned a few years later as national heroes, but the trauma cemented Veloso's commitment to a democratic Brazil - a vow he renewed in an October op-ed he penned for the New York Times on the eve of Jair Bolsonaro's election: "I was forced into exile once. It won't happen again. I want my music, my presence, to be a permanent resistance to whatever anti-democratic feature may come out of a probable Bolsonaro government."
Politics weren't mentioned explicitly during Monday night's concert, but if Veloso's long-term proposition involves waving off the iron fist of authoritarianism with harmonies of every color, he was obviously carrying out his life's work onstage, filling the air with shimmering pleasure, and a latent suggestion of dread, too. All the brightness in the room meant it was very dark outside.
The show began with two flashes - one tune famously recorded before Veloso's exile and one after. The first was "Baby," a ballad that embodied tropicalia's hybridized aesthetic with a dash of English ("Baby, I love you ") and a seemingly bottomless voluptuousness. After that, "O Seu Amor," a song penned by Gil that allowed father and sons to sing in telepathic, trapezoidal harmony - as if some impossible nano-breeze were suddenly swaying their DNA strands in perfect parallel.
From that point forward, everything felt astonishingly distinct, yet inexplicably vague. How could singing this pure, this concerted, this immediate still carry so much ambiguity?
When the quartet's melodies slanted toward the solemn (during "Ofertório," an ode written for Caetano's mother on her 90th birthday), the Velosos seemed to be mourning a future that may never arrive. When they floated into more high-hearted spaces (during "O Leãozinho," one of the greatest lullabies in the family songbook - or any songbook), you could see the four of them squinting off into utopia. Listening in both directions was almost enough to take you outside yourself. But only almost. This was happening.
Perhaps to prove it, Caetano leaped up from his chair late in the program and moved toward the edge of the stage, eager to shake out his limbs. He had just spent the past hour or so levitating through all of that lush genetic harmony, wise and weightless. Now he was dancing to the music of his children - feet still touching the ground, stepping into a future that can still be changed.

Orchestrated 'Stop Sanders' campaign would backfire on establishment Democrats

Texto completo: Establishment Democrats gearing up for a campaign to "stop" socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders from becoming their 2020 presidential nominee are playing with fire. That is, any concerted effort they make to block him from being the nominee will likely boomerang, only making him stronger.

On Tuesday, the New York Times reported on an increasing fear among the Democratic establishment and wealthy donors that Sanders could actually pull it off this time.

“There’s a growing realization that Sanders could end up winning this thing, or certainly that he stays in so long that he damages the actual winner,” David Brock, the liberal activist and Clintonite, told the paper, which reports that he said "he has had discussions with other operatives about an anti-Sanders campaign and believes it should commence 'sooner rather than later.'"

It's harder to imagine that establishment Democrats and former Clinton loyalists could do more to ensure that Sanders becomes the nominee -- or at least that he takes the fight all the way to the convention -- than to allow him to portray the opposition as being funded by wealthy donors and insiders who want to down out the voice of the people. Efforts that party insiders made to halt the rise of Donald Trump only helped propel him to the Republican nomination in 2016, and it would be a massive gift to Sanders this time around.

There are plenty of hucksters in politics eager to take advantage of the fears of rich people and convince them that with a well-funded effort, they can block somebody's drive toward the nomination. But we're living in a different era in which the value of big money donations has been reduced and voters are increasingly skeptical of warnings coming from elites. That's especially true of those who are inclined to back an ideological crusader such as Sanders.

If Sanders is to be defeated this time, it won't come from some sort of establishment-run effort. It will come from rival candidates attacking his vulnerabilities. He's old, he's a white male running in the most diverse field the Democrats have ever put together, he has had difficulty connecting with minority groups, and there's a wide gap between his promises and his ability to actually enact them.

So, he's far from some sort of lock to win the nomination. But if he goes down, it won't be as a result of some Brock-type attack group.

Texto completo: A Republican primary competitor to Iowa Rep. Steve King raised more money than the longtime incumbent during the first quarter of 2019.

King’s campaign spent more than it raised. The team took in $61,667, while it spent $69,502 during the first quarter, according to Federal Election Commission filings. During that same period, King’s top primary challenger Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra raised four times that amount, roughly $260,000.

Earlier this year King came under fire for inquiring why phrases like “white nationalist” and “white supremacist” have become “offensive" during an interview with the New York Times.

In the ensuring controversy over what critics saw as King voicing support for white supremacy, the congressman came out and said he he rejects white nationalism and white supremacy and accused the Times of misquoting him. King was stripped of his assignments on the Judiciary and Agriculture committees, but defiantly said in February, "I have noting to apologize for," and declared his intention to seek reelection.

King has served in Congress since 2003 and faced a close challenge during the 2018 election. Feenstra announced he would challenge King during the Republican primary in 2020 after the Times interview came out.

“The president needs effective conservative leaders in Congress who will not only support his agenda, but actually get things done,” Feenstra said during the announcement of his candidacy. “… We don’t need any more sideshows or distractions; we need to start winning for Iowa’s families.”

HBO looks beyond 'Game of Thrones,' maybe back to a prequel

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - When the last drop - or gallon - of blood is shed and an exultant victor has ascended to the Iron Throne, viewers may be split over how HBO's fantasy saga ended but they'll be joined in deprivation.
"What do you do without Game of Thrones?' will be the lament heard after the May 19 finale, said media analyst Larry Gerbrandt. The question is even more critical to the pay-cable channel, which soared on dragon's wings with its hugely popular, eight-season adaptation of George R.R. Martin's novels.
Keeping subscribers on board means more than another hit, even one as globally dazzling as "Game of Thrones proved to be. But it's where HBO can start to protect its brand and position, observers say, an effort both demanded and compounded by an increasingly congested small-screen landscape and the expectations of the channel's corporate owner since 2016, AT&T.
"I think they need a prestige show on this level to remain HBO, Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN and former reporter for The New York Times. But "more than ever, it's really hard to find a hit show and to break through in this marketplace.
The channel is well into the hunt for a worthy successor, with one possibility an untitled prequel to "Game of Thrones created by Martin and Jane Goldman and starring Naomi Watts. Set to begin shooting a pilot in June, it's among several potential "Thrones spinoffs being weighed, with discussions at HBO about "how many is too many, said programming chief Casey Bloys.
"We have high hopes for the pilot, he said. "But I want to be clear, nobody is going into this thinking that we're going to do a prequel and all of a sudden everybody who automatically watched Game of Thrones' is going to watch this. ... It'll have a different feel and different rhythm. We're not trying to do the same show again.
That begs the question of what more HBO has to offer, he said. During a period in which "Game of Thrones was off the air for scheduling reasons, series including "Westworld, "Sharp Objects and "Barry proved strong draws, Bloys said.
"I'm not going to argue that we won't miss Game of Thrones.' It's been a fantastic show for us, but life does go on, he said. He points to a deep bench of returnees, including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon's "Big Little Lies, and newcomers including the graphic novel-based "Watchmen from "Lost producer Damon Lindelof. One marquee series that's also in its final season: the much-admired comedy "Veep, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
HBO, which launched in 1972 and whose cachet has long justified the boastful slogan, "It's not TV. It's HBO, has reached this crossroads before. At the turn of the century, pop-culture sensations "The Sopranos and "Sex and the City boosted the channel's visibility and subscribers and made it a serious player for prestige awards - including cable's first-ever Emmys for best drama and comedy series. After the shows wrapped, the channel moved nimbly on with audience-pleasers including "Six Feet Under and "True Blood.
But that was then, and this is the time of streaming - or, in shorthand, Netflix, along with a growing host of others including Amazon and Hulu - and a shoulder-bumping rush for stars and showmakers to churn out more and more fare for outlets already awash in programming.
HBO, no longer a singular alternative to staid broadcast networks, also got new corporate ownership when AT&T bought its parent company, Time Warner. HBO recently saw the exit of its chief executive, Richard Plepler, who had been with the channel for nearly 30 years and guided it to "Game of Thrones glory.
With AT&T's resources, HBO has stepped up production and will see a 50% increase in the number of original program hours this year, Bloys said, arguing that volume doesn't preclude high quality: "There's nothing in 2019 that we're putting on the air because we're trying to hit an hour count. ... We haven't lowered any of our standards to reach a certain level of programming and there is no pressure to do otherwise from WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey, he said.
Subscribers ultimately will decide whether they think the shows are what they want. But expanding the pipeline is unavoidable, said Tuna Amobi, a media and entertainment analyst with investment firm CFRA.
"It's a very different competitive landscape for HBO than it was when they launched Game of Thrones,' and they realize that. That's why you see them ratcheting up their investments in their programming, Amobi said. Also key is how HBO's online platform is integrated with planned WarnerMedia streaming offerings to reach the broadest audience possible and make full use of its content, he added.
HBO "cannot rely on the old ways of doing things and hope that being a premium channel will bail you out, he said.
"Game of Thrones, which debuted in 2011, has flourished despite the confounding number of small-screen choices. From its first-season average weekly tally of 9.3 million cumulative viewers, the series rose to a seventh-season high of 32.8 million across all HBO platforms, including the channel itself and streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now and over a period extending 30 days beyond the season's end.
It benefited from the devoted following for Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire clutch of novels. It was richly and painstakingly produced, filmed in 10 countries including Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Morocco, Iceland and Canada. Its appealing cast became household names, and the female characters that grew in stature and strength as the drama unfolded are routinely namechecked as part of the female-empowerment zeitgeist.
"Game of Thrones could boast of its Emmy dominance as well, with 47 trophies to date including three best drama series awards. Last year, it denied a second consecutive win to a worthy opponent, Hulu's "The Handmaid's Tale, but HBO itself lost valuable Emmy bragging rights: It was surpassed in total nominations for the first time in 17 years and by relative newcomer Netflix, and the streamer tied HBO in wins.
Analyst Gerbrandt, of Media Valuation Partners, isn't counting the channel out. Many viewers still like so-called "curated TV delivered to them, as opposed to searching online through dozens or hundreds of offerings, he said. There's also the power of perception at work.
"If there's a brand that survives strictly on name, it's probably HBO, he said.

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador’s interior minister.
Assange’s behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he’s a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange’s publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first?
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone’s personal emails and under what circumstances? One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn’t accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government’s decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham’s bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange’s process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg’s charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that’s just me.

NJ Journalism Hall of Fame ceremony sets a precedent

Texto completo: WAYNE – Five of the best journalists in New Jersey history will be honored this week at William Paterson University in a ceremony being touted as a first for the state.
The New Jersey chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, with the university's chapter of the society, will recognize the inaugural class of the New Jersey Journalism Hall of Fame on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Martini Room at Hobart Hall. Doors will open at 6:30 p.m.
The inductees, who were nominated by past presidents of the state chapter of the SPJ and approved by its board of directors, include broadcast and print journalists.
"New Jersey has a rich history of great journalism," said John Ensslin, president of the state chapter of the SPJ.
"With our hall of fame at William Paterson," he added, "we will honor journalists who got their start here and went on to great careers elsewhere, or those who made their mark in the Garden State."
Among the inductees are: Jonathan Alter of Montclair, an author and former columnist for Newsweek; John McPhee of Princeton, an author and writer for The New Yorker; and Anna Quindlen, a native of South Brunswick, an author and former columnist for The New York Times.
Two journalists will be recognized posthumously.
Gabe Pressman, a correspondent for WNBC-TV who died in 2017, will be honored with Edith Shapiro, an editor of the now-defunct Newark Evening News who died in 2010.
Ensslin, a former reporter for The Record and NorthJersey.com who now works for ColoradoPolitics.com, said inductees will receive engraved glass trophies.
He said William Paterson was chosen as the site for the inaugural ceremony due, in part, to the partnership that exists between the state and university chapters of the SPJ.
Montclair State University and a restaurant in Newark also were considered as venues, he said.
Ensslin will be among a trio of journalists honored for their recent contributions to the university chapter of the SPJ; he led a podcasting workshop on campus in October.
The ceremony, to be co-hosted by Miriam Ascarelli, vice president of the state chapter of the SPJ, and Nicholas Hirshon, a William Paterson journalism professor, will feature the unveiling of a plaque — bearing the inductees' names — to be on permanent display at Hobart Hall.
Hirshon, who established the university chapter of the SPJ and serves as its adviser, said students are excited for the ceremony.
"They'll get to see someone like Jonathan Alter on their campus, in a room where they have classes," said Hirshon, a former reporter for the Daily News.
"It brings gravitas to that space, and it makes them proud to be William Paterson journalism students," he added. "It just invigorates them to know there's a future in this industry."
Daryl Moore, dean of the university's College of the Arts and Communication, said he sees the upcoming event as a "win-win for professional journalism organizations and our program here at William Paterson."
The university has agreed to host the New Jersey Journalism Hall of Fame ceremony for three straight years, Moore said.
The cost to go to Thursday's ceremony is $20 in advance or $25 at the door. Appetizers and soft drinks will be served.
To buy tickets in advance, visit the New Jersey chapter of the SPJ website. Proceeds will benefit the state and university chapters of the SPJ.

House Democrats subpoena Deutsche Bank, other institutions tied to Trump

Texto completo: House Democrats issued subpoenas Monday for records from Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions, seeking information regarding President Trump's business ventures as several congressional panels took steps to intensify their scrutiny of the president's personal accounts and corporate dealings.
The subpoenas, first reported by the New York Times, were issued by the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees, which have been leading the Democrats' probe of Trump's finances. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, said in a statement Monday that Trump's "potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern."
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has also said the panels want to know whether the president's financial transactions left him susceptible to foreign influence.
In a statement Monday, Schiff referred to the Deutsche Bank summons as a "friendly subpoena" - suggesting that the bank may have requested the order before complying with it. A representative for Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night, but Schiff added that the bank was working with the panels, noting that he looked "forward to their continued cooperation and compliance."
Lawmakers have focused special attention on Deutsche Bank since Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen said Trump provided it with financial records that inflated his assets to secure loans from the company to finance real estate projects and, in one case, to attempt to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills. The bank is reported to have played a critical role in sustaining Trump's real estate empire by providing him critical high-risk loans at a time when the businessman was having difficulty securing funds from other institutions.
The transactions Trump conducted with the bank are of interest not just to Democratic lawmakers investigating the president. Last month, the New York attorney general also subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to loans it had made to Trump's companies in recent years.
Deutsche Bank is not the only financial institution connected to Trump that has been cooperating with the House panels' probes of his finances. Last week, House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) announced that he would subpoena Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for records pertaining to the president's financial affairs. Cummings said Mazars had requested a "friendly subpoena," citing laws and rules that the firm said required a subpoena before it could issue such records.
The president's lawyers have been pushing the accounting firm not to comply with that order, arguing that the congressional subpoena "would not be valid or enforceable."
Similar clashes over subpoenas are expected to transpire between lawmakers and the administration in the weeks ahead as House Democrats push Trump's team to turn over documents ranging from the president's tax returns to the full report and underlying materials produced in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In retrospect, maybe it was not the best idea to award newsrooms for their coverage of a story that was still ongoing. It certainly seems like a poor decision, considering that special counsel Robert Mueller’s since-shuttered two-year investigation failed to “establish that the members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” according to Attorney General William Barr.

In the Pulitzer's defense, however, everyone in the press was doing the collusion thing. It was all the rage. In fact, some are still doing it.

“For deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the committee explained in 2017 when it announced its national reporting award for the Times and the Post.

The committee’s excellence in journalism award recognized specific reporters, including the Times’ Matt Apuzzo and Maggie Haberman as well as the Post’s Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller, which is humorous considering each of these journalists contributed in some way to the mountain of misinformation produced by the press’s reckless pursuit of the narrative alleging President Trump is a Kremlin asset.

Apuzzo, for example, bylined a report titled, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence.” Former FBI Director James Comey personally refuted that charge during a congressional hearing, saying the story “was not true.” Haberman, meanwhile, mimicked a leftover Clinton campaign talking point in her reporting, claiming inaccurately that “all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Moscow interfered in the U.S. election to get him elected.” Further, Haberman and Apuzzo bylined a report that claimed former national security adviser Michael Flynn had said in a tweet that he is “the sole scapegoat for what happened.” But Flynn never said that — a parody account did.

Over at the Post, Nakashima co-authored a report that claimed Russian operatives hacked the Vermont Burlington Electric Department. The Post later published a separate report acknowledging that this was almost certainly false.

Nakashima, along with her Post colleagues Adam Entous and Greg Miller, also reported that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions “met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later did not disclose” in security clearance forms. Their false implication was that the former lawmaker tried to conceal secret contacts with foreign entities who may or may not have conspired to steal the 2016 presidential election. What the Post did not say in that report is that Sessions was instructed specifically by the FBI officials who walked him through the application process that he did not need to list meetings he had taken as a senator.

Amazingly enough, the Pulitzer committee cited this specific Sessions report as an example of the “deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage” that earned the Post and the Times their joint national reporting award. The committee also cited a Times report alleging that the 2016 election was influenced in a really meaningful way by Russian memes.

There’s more, and some of it is not as disastrously flawed as the rest of this shoddy coverage, but it is hard to get away from the fact that the Times and the Post's wall-to-wall collusion coverage amounted to a lot of nothing, and often factually incorrect nothing at that.

The lesson for the Pulitzer committee is this: Maybe wait until we know the story is true before handing out reporting awards.

Texto completo: The drug companies that Ohio officials blame for fueling the state’s opioid epidemic are demanding highly personal information about its victims.
As part of the state’s litigation against companies such as Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and others, the companies want:
• Ten years’ worth of medical records and the criminal histories of any Ohioan the state contends was harmed by the drug makers.
• The names of every Ohioan whose addiction can be traced to their allegedly illegal practices over the past decade.
• The names, addresses and Social Security numbers of every Ohioan who submitted a claim to state-funded insurers to cover opioids for chronic pain since 2010.
The demand for information on millions of Ohioans comes as the companies defend themselves against a wave of litigation accusing them of planting the seeds of the opioid crisis. The suits, filed by about 2,000 governmental units, say the companies intentionally misinformed doctors about the drugs’ potential to cause addiction when prescribed for long-term pain conditions and then rushed billions of pills into the marketplace.
The result, the suits say: More than 100,000 overdose deaths in the United States and untold suffering by addicts and their families.
“In 2012, the total number of opioid doses prescribed to Ohio patients soared to 793 million — enough to supply every man, woman and child in the state with 68 pills each,” the state’s suit against the opioid makers says. “In 2016 alone, 2.3 million Ohio patients — roughly 20 percent of the state’s population — were prescribed an opioid drug.”
The Ohio suit, which is being heard in Chillicothe, seeks to recover money on behalf of state programs such as Medicaid and the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation. Other claims by 1,600 local governments have been consolidated and are being heard in a separate proceeding by a federal judge in Cleveland. The first track of those federal cases, brought by Summit County, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, are set for trial in October.
One of the drug-making defendants, Purdue Pharma, is demanding Social Security numbers of Ohioans who’ve received opioids for chronic pain. The New York Times earlier this month reported that the company’s owners, members of the billionaire Sackler family, continue to profit from prescription opioids and from the addiction crisis itself.
In 2007, as Purdue pleaded guilty to misrepresenting the addictive properties of its product, OxyContin, and as more legal troubles loomed, the Sacklers formed another company, Rhodes, to serve as a “landing pad” to sell generic opioids, the paper reported. Then, in 2016, the Sacklers undertook Project Tango, which acknowledged that “pain treatment and addiction are naturally linked” and sought to profit not only from opioids, but from the overdose-reversal drug naloxone as well, The Times reported.
Asked by The Dispatch why Purdue should be trusted with Ohioans’ Social Security numbers and medical information, a spokesman said that such information is necessary to defend itself against the state.
“The state seeks to hold Purdue responsible for every opioid prescription for chronic pain that was paid for by the state over a 10-year period,” Robert Josephson said in an email. “Thus, the state of Ohio, and not Purdue, has put those prescriptions at issue. Purdue intends to show that these prescriptions written by medical professionals were appropriate and/​or medically necessary. Purdue needs information about the prescription claims and the state’s decision to reimburse the claims to address the state’s primary allegations against Purdue. Purdue has requested that the state provide basic information for each opioid prescription claim, including certain patient information, to allow it to meaningfully review the alleged improper claims.”
If the past is any guide, a looming trial puts pressure on defendants to settle. In early March, Purdue lost a motion to delay a trial set for May in a lawsuit brought by the state of Oklahoma. By late March, Purdue had agreed to a $270 million settlement.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said the purpose of the drug makers’ sweeping information requests is to delay the Chillicothe trial from early next year at least until late 2020.
“These discovery requests are galactic in their overbreadth, and are designed to drag out the defendants’ day of reckoning — they ought to rename the firm Boggs, Downe & Delay,” he said to in an email. “But we’re going to be ready to tell Ohio’s story to a jury.”
Johnson & Johnson, which is asking the state to name every person who became addicted or otherwise harmed by its allegedly bad acts, said its actions regarding opioid manufacture and sale were “appropriate and responsible.”
“These discovery requests seek information about the sweeping allegations the state has made in its complaint,” Sabrina Strong, national counsel for Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, said in an email. “The law requires the state to identify what, if any, information the state has to support its claims. Janssen seeks this information solely to address the state’s serious allegations — not to delay the trial, which has not yet been set. To the extent there are privacy concerns related to any information the state must provide in response to discovery requests, the information will be protected as appropriate by court order.”
Some similar issues have already been decided in the federal litigation in Cleveland.
A special master, David R. Cohen, in that case ruled that that the companies are entitled to sensitive patient information, but it must be protected by redactions and other “de-intentifying” measures where possible and all material produced must be designated “Highly-Confidential — Attorneys’ Eyes Only.”
In earlier rulings, Cohen ruled that the drug companies’ requests for information about every Ohioan allegedly harmed by the companies’ supposed bad acts were “clearly overbroad.” He limited the number of such disclosures to 500 in some instances, 300 in others.

This border wall has doors. Big ones.
By Manny Fernandez in Los Indios, Tex.
The border wall doesn't get any shorter or stranger than this -- giant, pointy-topped steel pillars that would seem imposing, if only there were more of them.
This border fence has exactly 36 burgundy-colored beams. They stand alone on a grassy island in South Texas where two dirt roads intersect. It's open on the left and open on the right. You can walk around the whole thing at a fast clip in 17.36 seconds, a quick lap around a pocket-sized piece of America's border security.
The line that is the border wall here is dotted. It zigs. It zags. It stops. It starts. It stops again. It has corners where it mimics the twists and turns of the Rio Grande. And it has doors. Sometimes, these doors are gates that open when a code is entered on a keypad. Sometimes, these doors are full-fledged openings -- a road cuts into the fence, leaving a gap that essentially gives the Border Patrol one more thing to worry about.
The mini-wall is the unusual product of two such openings. The fence line in the Texas border town of Los Indios spreads out north of the Los Indios International Bridge, about 20 miles northwest of Brownsville. The steel-slat wall traces a path parallel to Robertson Street, in a flat rural landscape of corn and grain sorghum fields. But at the point where Robertson Street intersects with Rio Grande Avenue, the border wall takes a hard left and flows to the west along Rio Grande Avenue.
The fence designers created an opening on Robertson but also put another one at Rio Grande. So as the fence turns at this intersection, the two openings create a leftover morsel of wall in the middle: a lonely, taxpayer-funded gothic median.
President Trump lamented the various doors in the border wall last week, during a border-security roundtable in Calexico, Calif. He talked about a stretch of fence along the Rio Grande that had been erected under previous administrations, saying it was "not a good-looking wall" because it had "36 doors that you can drive a truck through."
"So now we're filling up those big, those big gaping wounds in this wall and it's going to have a big effect," Mr. Trump said.
But it's unclear if the president was aware of this Los Indios patch, which was built around 2009. Local and federal officials said the funding dried up to close the openings and install gates that would connect the grassy island with the rest of the fencing.
Representative Filemon B. Vela Jr., a Democrat who represents Brownsville in Congress and whose district includes Los Indios, said the little piece of fence illustrated the pointlessness of a border wall, regardless of which administration built it.
"I've voted against every single piece of border wall funding that's ever come up, and I'm going to continue to do so," Mr. Vela said. "Decisions are being made in Washington in terms of where to put fencing that don't make any sense."
As the president suggested, this strange little spot's days appear to be numbered. A Border Patrol official who oversees the Los Indios area, Henry Leo, the patrol agent in charge of the agency's station in Harlingen, Tex., said plans are in the works to finally install the necessary gates in the next one to three years.
"We did request additional fencing and gates in that area, so what you see right now is not the complete picture," Mr. Leo said. "The plan is to connect to that piece of fencing and make it a continuous fence with gates."
Both Mr. Leo and the mayor of Los Indios, Rick Cavazos, defended the fence in the area, including the stand-alone section, saying that overall the fencing had helped decrease illegal crossings. "I saw a dramatic decline in crossings and apprehensions as a result of the barrier," said Mr. Cavazos, who is a retired Border Patrol agent. "In 2004, 2005, 2006, this was a high crossing area. People would come up from the river. The numbers went down."
On a hot April afternoon, it was all quiet at the fence island. The loudest sound was the soil: the dry brush, dirt and grass crunches underfoot. The pillars of the fence are as rough as sandpaper, and leave little red flakes on your fingertips that resemble chili powder.
Adding to the head-scratching quality of this fence is its location.
On one side of the fence is America. But the other side is America, too. The fence runs inland, far from the river, the middle of which is the official boundary between Mexico and the United States. That means this 36-beam fence in one sense divides the country itself. In that sense, the openings in the fence are necessary: They allow property owners and ranchers to access their land that is north of the river but south of the fence, a region locals call a "no man's land."
Here, as much as anywhere, the Border Patrol is watching. Walk around the spot, and it's only a matter of minutes before two agents drive up in marked and unmarked vehicles.

Number of the week: 27,000
That's how many children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system this month.
A story this week by Michael D. Shear, Miriam Jordan and Manny Fernandez explores years of warnings that the U.S. immigration system is broken, or on the verge of breaking, and how it got there:
In recent days, officials have grasped for ever-more-dire ways to describe the situation: "operational emergency"; "unsustainable"; "systemwide meltdown."
One top official said simply: "The system is on fire."

An intense week for border news
By Caitlin Dickerson, New York Times national immigration reporter
First came the news that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had resigned, likely at the request of President Trump. Then, at least two other high ranking agency officials were pegged for dismissal -- all of it happening days after the president had pulled back on his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with Mr. Trump telling reporters that he had decided to go in a "tougher direction."
It's been a whirlwind week on the immigration front, with all signs suggesting that the president plans to triple down on his goal of securing the border. The unusually large number of heads rolling around Washington seemed to indicate that anyone with misgivings about the administration's plans will be asked -- if not forced -- to leave.
Mr. Trump is operating under mounting pressure from unauthorized border crossings that are steadily increasing. And he's contending with the painful reality that after 14 months of harsh policies designed to discourage immigration, he, the president who was elected on a promise to crack down on border crossings, has not made a meaningful dent in them.
To the contrary, whoever fills the now-open jobs in his administration will have to contend with record numbers of Central American families seeking asylum, all of whom are being processed through a decades-old system that is not equipped to handle them. And their efforts will be frustrated by the same set of laws and court settlements that have blocked many of the administration's attempts thus far from going into effect.
It was those laws that led to the downfall of Ms. Nielsen, who lost her job because the president felt that she was not hawkish enough. Though she became known during her tenure as the public face of many of Mr. Trump's most controversial immigration policies, including family separation, in private, the two had often clashed when she cautioned him about the legal and logistical constraints that rendered his policy ideas untenable.

Texto completo: Who is Billie Eilish?
The question is as provocative as those the 17-year-old poses in her first studio album, "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" It debuted last week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, making Eilish the only artist born in the 2000s to achieve the feat. (She's also the youngest female artist to do so in a decade.)
The edgy pop music doubles as Eilish's Gen Z membership card, whether commenting on her peers' benzo habit - "I don't need a xanny to feel better," she whispers on the track "Xanny" - or sampling a scene from "The Office" on "My Strange Addiction." Her lyrics are the perfect encapsulation of online culture today, both darkly comical and casually morbid. She moodily sings "Bury A Friend" from the perspective of the monster under her bed, then reveals that she herself is the monster, her own nemesis.
Like the teen pop stars who preceded her, Eilish could also be described as precocious. The album's giggly prelude titled "!!!!!!!" reminds listeners of her youth (while alerting us to the fact that she has taken off her Invisalign). But unlike some of her predecessors, she maintains her own creative vision - even while writing and producing music with her 21-year-old brother, Finneas, and recording in a house belonging to the actor parents who home-schooled them. As Eilish recently remarked to the New York Times, she could easily hand the reins over to someone else but, like with her music, instead chooses to pick out her own clothes, envision her own videos and run her own Instagram account.
"Everything could be easier if I wanted it to," she told the Times. "But I'm not that kind of person and I'm not that kind of artist. I'd rather die than be that kind of artist."
The intensity of Eilish's autonomy is on full display in her Instagram account, @wherearetheavocados, which boasts 17.9 million followers. Her blank stares and androgynous baggy clothing feel less controlled, less sexualized than the image teen pop stars were once encouraged to adopt. It's an aesthetic that speaks to the SoundCloud generation, which makes sense given that Eilish's career kicked off after she posted the ballad "Ocean Eyes" on the music-streaming platform in 2016. She signed to Interscope Records that same year and has also built up a fervent Instagram and Snapchat following since.
At a recent music business conference, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl compared Eilish's connection with her youthful audience to "what was happening with Nirvana in 1991."
"My daughters are obsessed with Billie Eilish," he said. "And what I'm seeing happening with my daughters is the same revolution that happened to me at their age. . . . When I look at someone like Billie Eilish, I'm like . . . rock-and-roll is not even close to being dead."
Eilish has cited, along with Lana Del Rey and Amy Winehouse, rappers Tyler, the Creator, and Earl Sweatshirt as inspirations because, as she told Elle magazine at 15, "a lot of the stuff that real rappers say is kind of ahead of what other people are saying." Eilish herself addresses heavier topics such as the toll fame can take on mental health in her work and interviews, including a video Vanity Fair published late last year of two juxtaposed Eilish interviews - one from October 2017, the other from October 2018.
"I'm kind of jealous of Billie a year ago," she said in 2018, more morose than before. "I'm really not about to . . . pity myself for people recognizing who I am, because I'm really grateful for it. But, I don't know, I would like to go to, I don't know, anywhere and not be always recognized."
With such a successful Billboard debut, Eilish has infiltrated the mainstream - Saturday marked her first performance at Coachella, and she even appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's talk show earlier this month, where they discussed her high-profile fans (e.g. Grohl, Thom Yorke, Julia Roberts) and her recent candidness about having Tourette's syndrome.
Close scrutiny accompanies this level of fame, and Eilish has gotten a taste of online backlash. In "Wish You Were Gay," which was first released as a single, she sings about wishing she had been rejected by a boy for a different reason: "To give your lack of interest an explanation/ Don't say that I'm not your type/ Just say I'm not your preferred sexual orientation." A small number of listeners accused Eilish of "gaybaiting" with the song's title, and she responded by saying that the lyrics were "so not supposed to be an insult" and that they had been "a little bit misinterpreted."
Eilish has also gotten some flak for performing a tribute song to her friend XXXTentacion, a rapper who was awaiting trial on domestic violence charges when he was killed last summer. "I want to be able to mourn, I don't want to be shamed for it," Eilish told the Times of the song. "I don't think I deserve getting hate for loving someone that passed."
But Eilish's success hasn't faltered, as Billboard reports that her first release, the 2017 EP "Don't Smile at Me," has spent 67 weeks on the chart and peaked at No. 14 in January. "When We All Fall Asleep" scored the second-largest sales week for any album released this year and, with 194 million on-demand streams in its debut week, became the third-largest streaming week ever for a female artist.

Resumen: The semi-comical film, based on the memoir, "Black Klansman," shows 1970s black police officer Ron Stallworth joining the Ku Klux Klan by telephone. Since Stallworth, obviously, can't attend Klan meetings, his white partner, Flip Zimmerman, goes instead. Part of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, in 1961 he participated in the Freedom Rides aimed at desegregating buses, in marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr., and was arrested attempting to integrate a whites-only cafeteria in Jackson, Miss. Robert Silverman has a behavioral health counseling practice in Champaign and is a former executive director of the Champaign-Urbana Jewish Federation.

Texto completo: In "BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's 2018 Oscar winner for best adapted screenplay, the Ku Klux Klan gets humiliated. Underground black activist Stokely Carmichael/Kwame Ture is partially redeemed.
And rabbinic sage Hillel, 110 BCE to 10 CE, is catapulted into the 21st century, reaching the largest congregation of his life: "If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am for myself alone, who am I? If not now, when?"
"BlacKkKlansman," however, doesn't acknowledge Hillel, even within the long list of credits.
The semi-comical film, based on the memoir, "Black Klansman," shows 1970s black police officer Ron Stallworth joining the Ku Klux Klan by telephone.
Since Stallworth, obviously, can't attend Klan meetings, his white partner, Flip Zimmerman, goes instead. Recognizing opportunity, Lee makes Zimmerman Jewish.
So undercover officer -- and Jewishly oblivious -- Zimmerman is tasked to pretend he's Stallworth, while undercover officer Stallworth is tasked with infiltrating Carmichael's lecture at Colorado College's Black Student Union. Stallworth learns Carmichael changed his name to Ture, lovingly played by actor Corey Hawkins, who begins: "It is time for you to stop running away from being black."
He describes Tarzan movies: "White Tarzan used to beat us, the black natives. I would sit there yelling: Kill The Beasts. Kill The Savages. Kill 'em. Kill 'em! ... But what I was saying was: Kill me! It was as if a young Jewish boy saw Nazis taking Jews off to concentration camps and cheered them on."
He finishes with Hillel: "If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am for myself alone, who am I? If not now, when?" Lee added: "And if not you, who?"
Hillel's prime expression of identity doesn't say what to do. It's a plea: figure out what it means being Jewish among other people.
Be a me. Acknowledge others. Do it now.
Hillel's lines are straight out of Mishnah, the ancient Jewish text, Ethics of the Fathers. For two millennia, these exact words have, arguably, carried the beating heart of Judaism.
Surely, Lee understood leaving Hillel's phrases unattributed may trigger accusations. Additionally, since Ture expressed notoriously anti-Semitic language when alive, was this mockery? What was Lee doing?
By channeling Hillel's sophistication, Ture's own history is rewritten, ironically, using Jewish history.
"BlacKkKlansman" tells a simple, anti-Klan story. Hillel's voice adds acuity, sanitizing Ture, born Stokely Carmichael.
Carmichael (1941-1998), pre-Ture, from Trinidad, raised by his grandmother, joined his parents in Harlem in 1952. Attending the Bronx High School of Science, according to Wikipedia, "he participated in a boycott of a local White Castle restaurant that did not hire blacks."
Carmichael attended Howard University, where he popularized the phrase "Black Power." Part of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, in 1961 he participated in the Freedom Rides aimed at desegregating buses, in marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr., and was arrested attempting to integrate a whites-only cafeteria in Jackson, Miss.
Carmichael pivoted, in 1969 leaving for Guinea, Africa, becoming Kwame Ture. Invited back by universities, he didn't speak as portrayed in "BlacKkKlansman."
In a 1970 live interview, as Carmichael, the New York Times reported journalist David Frost asking: who was "the white man and the black man you most admire in the world." Carmichael answered: "If you ... ask me who I think was the greatest white man ... I would think Adolph Hitler."
The Times reported: "gasps, booing and jeering from the studio audience interrupted."
Carmichael continued, "When you talk about greatness, you don't put ethical judgments or moral judgments on them. .... Adolph Hitler -- I'm not putting a judgment on what he did -- if you asked me for my judgment morally, I would say it was bad, what he did was wrong, was evil, etc. But I would say he was a genius, nevertheless."
Did Carmichael/Ture truly believe Hitler the great white genius? Unlikely. But he learned the oration skills, how hyperbole manipulates, whipping people up. He learned connecting Zionists, violence, demons, Hitler and Jews always got him maximum attention.
Ture gained fame by lobbing anti-Semitism into student crowds. Universities offered money and a stage, including the UIUC's Foellinger auditorium, where he railed against demon Zionists, advocating violent overthrow of the U.S. and Israel.
Ture had unapologetic Trinidadian-American-African spirit. Hillel became known as a spiritual leader of the Jewish people in Jerusalem during the time of King Herod and the Roman emperor Augustus.
Hillel and his colleagues were preserved in the writings of the Mishnah, synthesizing and documenting the oral tradition of rabbinic/Jewish consciousness and identity.
"BlacKkKlansman" provided Hillel a modern audience. Using once anti-Semitic orator, Ture, as Hillel's agent, was inspirational. Hillel deserves the recognition.

Texto completo: Lord only knows how many different businesses Irwin Jacobs touched during his career, but it was his high-profile public role as a takeover artist that turned him into a celebrity.
Now such people might be called activist investors, but takeover artist or corporate raider is what they were known as in the 1980s. That's when Jacobs routinely made financial news, by jostling for control of the Pabst Brewing Co., the Walt Disney Co., Kaiser Steel and other companies.
A Jacobs investor group hardly ever got control. Yet when Jacobs sold his stake and moved on, as he reportedly did at a big profit with Disney, he still claimed a big win.
"I think Disney is better off than it's been in years," he told the Washington Post in 1984, after Disney had restructured itself. "I have served a purpose in that company."
At the time that kind of statement probably led to nothing but eye-rolling among corporate managers, yet the argument still holds up.
Jacobs, 77, died last week in a personal tragedy, shooting his wife and then himself.
Though still well-known in local business circles, his celebrity peaked back in the 1980s. And it's important to understand that era, of how there came to be an opportunity for guys like Jacobs and how having them in the market forced companies to clean up their operations.
Shareholders back then had been through a rough patch, as only the lucky or the masterful could have made much money in stocks in the 1970s. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 into the early 1980s didn't get out of the high single digits, maybe half of what it is now.
There also had been
plenty of pain in the broader economy, with an unhappy combination of stagnant economic growth and price inflation. Americans had started feeling increasingly anxious about global competition, particularly as more Americans turned to Toyota and other imported brands for reliable and economical cars.
It was also just after the golden era of American conglomerates, big holding companies like Teledyne that bought company after company in all sorts of different industries. It wasn't just dealmaker CEOs who assembled unrelated businesses. Our local food giant General Mills once owned both the maker of Play-Doh and the retailer Talbots.
To the takeover investors, American companies looked unfocused and unresponsive to shareholders and were presided over by executives who appeared a little too satisfied just to be part of an exclusive club.
For those who sought to take on these companies, a hardscrabble background was an advantage. Victor Posner, whose shamelessly self-serving ways eventually got him banned from any involvement with a public company, is often credited as the pioneer of hostile takeovers. He reportedly gave up formal schooling to go to work at age 13.
The real skill here wasn't knowing how to add a lot of value to the products or services. It was understanding how much more some asset would be worth if it could somehow get carved out and sold to the right buyer. And the takeover investor had to have thick skin, as a lot of feathers get ruffled in a takeover fight.
Irwin Jacobs was already in the family business by the time he finished high school and gave college just a couple of days before quitting. His early years in business don't sound like they could have been easy, moving from buying and selling burlap bags to lots of other products.
A turning point in his career was buying the Grain Belt brewery, a deal that both netted a return as well as introduced him to a future partner, the banker and investor Carl Pohlad.
There's not nearly enough space to fully cover the busy period that followed. In a more or less typical project, he invested a couple of years into trying to take over Pabst, through tender offers, lawsuits and proxy campaigns. This and other forays turned him into a media star. "I like to buy dollars for 50 cents," the Wall Street Journal reported him explaining to a rapt audience of securities analysts in 1985.
Corporate CEOs along with boards of directors found ways to fight back, including measures like granting special rights to existing shareholders in a takeover, thus throwing sand in the gearbox of a takeover attempt. Companies also would buy back the corporate raider's stock, a practice called paying greenmail that let the raider pocket quick trading profits without completing a deal.
Jacobs said he was serious about wanting to be in charge, not simply being a corporate raider. He proved it when his group in 1985 did seize control of a big American corporation, AMF Inc.
In a conversation with the New York Times once the deal closed, Jacobs didn't bother masking his contempt for the AMF brass and their fondness for limos, private jets and executive dining rooms.
It wasn't long before market conditions changed enough for takeover activity to wind down. In looking back, American companies had become leaner and better focused, but not without costs. An example we are still living with is called Revlon duties for board members, named from a lawsuit brought in the battle for the beauty-products company.
The suit established a legal obligation for corporate boards in takeover situations to simply pick the highest price for shareholders. That seems to be one reason shareholder value now completely swamps any other consideration in overseeing public companies.
Jacobs didn't completely leave the public eye as takeover activity subsided. For years he remained a favorite source for journalists, if for no other reason than his willingness to get on the phone and respond to questions.
And that's maybe one of the reasons to look back wistfully at the takeover era. Jacobs sure made it sound like he was having an awful lot of fun.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK. – El consejo de redacción del periódico New York Times se mostró partidario de aprobar una legislación que restaure el acceso a las licencias de conducir para todos, independientemente del estado migratorio. Esta legislación permitirá que todos los neoyorquinos sigan el mismo proceso para solicitar una licencia, realizar un examen práctico y, si pasan, obtener la licencia.
“Este editorial es un respaldo crucial para una campaña en todo el estado que está generando más impulso cada día. Aplaudimos la decisión de la Junta Editorial de apoyar el restablecimiento del acceso a las licencias de conducir para todos, lo que es vital para la seguridad pública y la protección de nuestra comunidad”, dijo Javier H. Valdés, co-director ejecutivo de Make the Road New York.
El proyecto de ley en cuestión, que fue presentado en ambas cámaras de la Legislatura estatal, mejorará la seguridad pública y aportará beneficios económicos sustanciales al estado.
Valdés agregó que todos los residentes del estado, sin importar su estatus migratorio, deben pasar por el mismo proceso para obtener la licencia y el seguro. Para cientos de miles de inmigrantes en todo el estado, este problema es personal y urgente.
“Mientras continúa esta sesión legislativa, Make the Road New York sigue comprometido con la organización y la lucha para hacer que las carreteras de Nueva York sean más seguras, aumentar los ingresos de nuestro estado y proteger a nuestras familias inmigrantes”, destacó el activista.
Según el Instituto de Política Fiscal, generará $ 57 millones en ingresos gubernamentales anuales combinados, con un aumento adicional de ingresos de $ 26 millones y reducirá las primas de seguro en todo el estado. También jugará un papel importante en mantener a las familias unidas en toda Nueva York, ya que la administración de Trump busca todas las excusas posibles para alejar a los inmigrantes de sus seres queridos.
“Obtener acceso a una licencia de conducir cambiará drásticamente mi vida. Ha habido ocasiones en las que no he tenido otra opción, arriesgarme a ser detenido y ponerme en camino a la deportación por conducir sin una licencia. Ampliar el acceso a las licencias de conducir a todos los neoyorquinos tiene sentido”, explicó Aldo Padilla, residente de Staten Island y miembro de Make the Road New York.
De su parte Jorge García, residente de Long Island y también miembro de esta organización dijo: “En áreas como Long Island, donde vivo, conducir es la única opción para llegar a las escuelas de nuestros hijos, al trabajo, a las citas con el médico o cuando tener una emergencia Debido a la falta de transporte público, puede tomar horas llegar a cualquier lugar en autobús o en tren, y tomar un taxi es demasiado caro”.
García explicó que quiere poder ir al Departamento de Motores y Vehículos (DMV), presentar la solicitud, tomar el examen práctico y obtener su licencia de conducir para poder comprar su primer automóvil.
“Nuestras comunidades necesitan el liderazgo de Albany para restablecer el acceso a las licencias de conducir a todos los neoyorquinos este año”, agregó García.
De aprobarse la propuesta, que fue presentada por el asambleísta Marcos Crespo en conjunto con el senador Luis Sepúlveda , ambos demócratas de El Bronx, Nueva York se uniría a una docena de estados, y a la capital Washington DC, que ya permiten que a los inmigrantes indocumentados a aplicar por licencias para conducir.

Texto completo: Last weekend Ernest F. Hollings passed away at the age of 97, a passing noted mostly only by political junkies, and aging political junkies at that.
But his life and times deserve wider notice because Fritz Hollings was all that most Americans want our politics and our politicians to be.
Hollings was, first, an American patriot and public servant. He was a World War II vet and saw action in North Africa and Europe. He was awarded the Bronze Star.
But he loved politics -loved it. He loved the battle. And he loved beating the odds. When he decided to retire after 38 years in the Senate, a reporter asked him if it was because Republicans had become dominant in South Carolina and the race would have been a tough one. "That's exactly right," he said, and the race was a tough one in 1992 and 1980, and 1968, and he went down the list of all the years he'd won.
When Sam Donaldson once asked Hollings, a bitter enemy of the NAFTA agreement and free trade, where his suit was made, Hollings reply was, "I got it right down the street from where you got that wig."
He was blunt and he was outspoken and he was often funny and barbed. He never apologized for any of that. Politics was a contact sport. After that '92 race he said: "I don't have to get elected to a bloomin' thing. And I don't have to do things that are politically correct. The hell with everybody. I'm free at last."
But he did run one more time, and win one more time. He'd always been free.
Hollings hated government waste and was the last great deficit hawk in the Democratic Party -an author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control act of 1985, which imposed deficit reduction targets and automatic cuts if the targets were not met (it was diluted and deconstructed in subsequent years). There is no such Democrat today.
But he also believed in the positive role of government. There are some things government can do well, Hollings believed, and some things only government can do. His first great cause, and his abiding one, was the eradication of hunger in his home state and in rural America. He made a famous "hunger tour" and went to places he admitted he had not known existed, places where no politician had ever been. He wrote a book on the subject, and it moved the national debate. For here was a conservative Southerner, not an Eastern liberal, attempting to raise the nation's awareness of the hunger of the poor.
Hollings saw third-world conditions on that tour. He saw children with extended stomachs and families drinking unsafe and unclean water. The result was legislation that changed America by creating the food program for women, infants and children -WIC.
Hollings was impatient and increasingly so as he aged. He had no time for politics by poll or press conference. He had no sympathy for anti-government politicians at the top of the political food chain. "Give me a break, man," he said after one colleague's rant on the perils of big government. Let's do what we do well, forget what government does poorly and move on.
Hollings was the first in the Senate to champion the preservation of open waters and protection of the oceans. What entity but government could take on that mission?
We are here to get things done, was his constant refrain to his colleagues. He said that when he and his fellow soldiers came back from the war, "we wanted to do it all."And when he did finally leave the Senate, it was largely due to what he called "the outright money chase" -constantly taking time off from legislating to raise funds for re-election.
He said everyone was working on "the campaign and not the country."
He loved the Congress and his colleagues, but not what had happened to them.
Hollings' other great issue was "free" trade -he opposed it. He was unapologetically for protectionism if it meant protecting American jobs and workers, most especially South Carolina workers. Fritz Hollings practiced geographic politics. He was from somewhere. That, and not ideology, shaped him. He despised NAFTA because he was an independent thinker and had read the treaty. But also because he saw what it would do to his state's textile industry. He was the senator from South Carolina, not The Wall Street Journal or New York Times, he said.
Think about this. Where is Barack Obama actually from? Where are the Clintons or Mitt Romney from? Hollings went home when he retired. He raised money for a local hospital and wrote op-eds for his local paper.
Hollings had the courage to change. He was a segregationist who became an integrationist governor. He regretted voting for the Iraq war and became a harsh critic of it. As a young governor, he stuck his neck out for John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Hollings stuck his neck out whenever he thought he should. He relied on persuasion rather than polls and focus groups to get re-elected. His wife Peatsy was his focus group.
His governorship, from 1959 to 1963, was one profile in courage after another, as he accomplished peaceful school integration and fought "like a dirty dog" for a bill to establish state technical colleges. He was the first governor to hop on a plane and go straight to foreign companies cajoling them to come to his state. Thanks to Hollings' initiative and legacy, South Carolina is today a leading world manufacturer in automotive manufacturing and aerospace. He dragged the state into the 20th century and was 40 years ahead of his peers.
Hollings was an ardent Democrat, but a type of Democrat who probably could not survive today. His own mind, conscience and most of all his constituents, came before party. His was a politics formed not by abstraction and virtue signaling but by character and human connections.
Fritz Hollings had incredible physical posture. He stood tall. And it fit him. Men of his rectitude and fearlessness are rare in politics, in any age. In our age their existence has come to seem almost impossible.

Why 'tax the rich' is so spurious a demand

Texto completo: If I told you there was a movement to create a navy or air force, you might respond, "Don't we already have those?"
If I said we need a movement to convince bears to relieve themselves in the woods, you might say, "Wait. Isn't that happening already?"
But if I said we needed to tax the rich, a lot of people's first reaction would be, "Yes! It's about time!"
In fact, there's an astroturf movement based on precisely this notion. There was just a big conference, fittingly named the "Tax the Rich!" conference, hosted by a group called Patriotic Millionaires.
"Tax the Rich. Save America. Yes, it really is that simple," they explain in their mission statement.
This slogan is simply dishonest; rich people do, in fact, pay taxes. Just under half (48 percent) of federal revenue comes from income taxes. If you define the rich as the top 1 percent - which is probably too narrow, depending on the region of the country - the rich pay a big chunk of that.
In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 44 percent of Americans won't pay any federal income taxes for 2018. That doesn't mean they don't pay any taxes, of course. Payroll taxes eat up a big chunk of many Americans paychecks - a fact we all learn the first time we shout, "Who the hell is FICA!?"
But the income tax is remarkably progressive.
Once again citing the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of two left-of-center think tanks: the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute), Americans in the top 20 percent paid an estimated 87 percent of income taxes for 2018. This was up from 84 percent in 2017, which means that the "Trump tax cuts" actually made the tax code more progressive.
The folks shouting "Tax the rich!" know this, which is why, when they move beyond sloganeering, they say that what they really want is for the rich to "pay their fair share."
This is a more debatable claim because "fair" is in the eye of the beholder.
It's not preposterous to argue that the rich, however defined, should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. But it's also not preposterous to say that when 1 percent of the people provide more than a third of income tax revenue, they're already paying their fair share - and suggesting that people who don't want to pay even more are "unpatriotic" is bullying nonsense.
While we're on the topic of fairness, there's another common argument for hiking income taxes for the wealthy, or for even simply taxing wealth itself: The rich deserve it. Or, to be more generous, the super-rich don't deserve their money, while the rest of the country does.
The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo recently argued for "abolishing" billionaires outright.
Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke say we should make the rich less rich because income inequality is bad. Candidate Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (and many others) think that everything from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal can be financed largely - or entirely - by pillaging the bank accounts of the rich.
This is populist insanity masquerading as public finance.
According the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl, doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) "would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close."
You could literally confiscate 100 percent of the wealth of the entire one percent and not come close to paying for Sanders' version of Medicare for All (price tag: $32 trillion).
This points to my real problem with all of this "tax the rich" talk. It works from the assumption that the problems of ordinary Americans are the result of a tiny group of people selfishly refusing to do their part. Not only does this assume that the wealth of people who have paid considerable taxes still belongs to everyone, it's also simple scapegoating. By my lights, it would be no less outrageous if the math added up. But it doesn't, which makes it even more irresponsible.

Texto completo: "Game of Thrones" makes its much-anticipated return to HBO. And a new series based on a memoir by a disabled gay 20-something hits Netflix.
What's on TV
GAME OF THRONES 9 p.m. on HBO. Some have spent the past week celebrating the fact that spring has sprung. Others have had something else in mind: Winter is coming. That tagline for HBO's fantasy colossus, which has grown bigger and bigger since its 2011 debut, has reached peak relevance in the lead-up to the show's eighth season, which promises a final showdown between the living and the undead White Walkers (who have an ice dragon!). Season 8 should tie up loose ends while answering the big question of who will ultimately win the throne? Regardless of the answer, the brand is all but guaranteed to actively live on. "Five years from now," the "Thrones" star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau recently told The New York Times, "We will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land."
LES MISÉRABLES 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dominic West stars as the Jean Valjean to David Oyelowo's Javert in this adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel, about the pursuit of love and differing ideas of justice in 19th-century France. You won't find musical numbers (or Russell Crowe's pipes) here; this version by the "House of Cards" writer Andrew Davies favors spoken dialogue over singing, and markets itself as a faithful retelling of Hugo's story.
What's Streaming
SPECIAL Stream on Netflix. The writer Ryan O'Connell made a name for himself blogging on the pop culture lifestyle site Thought Catalog, then released a memoir, "I'm Special, and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves," about his experiences as a disabled gay 20-something. That book provides the basis for this new dark comedy series, which stars O'Connell (a first-time actor) playing a version of himself, with roughly 15-minute-long episodes. The series's overarching joke "is on people who aren't disabled, and how they view disabled people," he recently told The Times. O'Connell said that "giving them a show like 'Special,' which is funny and I'm the one making the jokes and I'm the one writing them -- I think it makes them feel at ease. They're like 'Oh O.K., this isn't some scary thing. Disabled people are just like me!' I don't know why this a revolutionary concept. I just think they don't know what to do with us at all."
STEVE JOBS: THE MAN IN THE MACHINE (2015) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Alex Gibney anatomizes the legend of Steve Jobs in this ambitious documentary, which charts the Apple leader's rise and dissects his image as both businessman and transformer of culture, with one eyebrow firmly raised. In his review for The Times, Nicolas Rapold wrote that Gibney's film "is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs." But, he noted, "even if this isn't the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across."

Texto completo: White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., defended Saturday the nearly $1 million he earned in royalties from his book published after his failed 2016 presidential election.

The self-described socialist said he does not "apologize for writing a book that was No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller."

Sanders told supporters that he "didn’t know it was a crime to write a good book," as he pushed back against claims of hypocrisy for wanting to tax the rich. Sanders received three disbursements of royalty money from New York-based publisher Macmillan - St. Martin's Press totaling $900,000, according to his most recent Senate financial disclosure.

“My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe,” Sanders said, frustrated by the line of questioning. “So again, I don’t apologize for writing a book that was No. 3 on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages, and that’s that.”

Sanders has made taxing "the millionaires and billionaires" a central component of his presidential campaigns both in 2016 and 2020, blaming the rich for ruining the American economy. "We will no longer tolerate 46 percent of all new income going to the very richest people in this country," Sanders said in his campaign kickoff last month.

Sanders agreed last week to release his tax returns while admitting that he was a millionaire.

The Vermont lawmaker currently sits in second place for the Democratic nomination, according to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average. He trails former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a presidential run, by 10 percentage points.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump confirmed in tweets Friday reports that White House officials have considered releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities in regions governed by Democrats, giving Democratic officials including Mayor Rahm Emanuel another opportunity to decry Trump immigration policies.
The Washington Post reported Thursday night about the plans, disclosed in emails released to the Post and The New York Times.
Trump responded Friday morning on Twitter, tweeting that the reports were true and officials have strongly considered placing immigrants in sanctuary cities.
In a statement released Friday morning, Emanuel said cities have been designating themselves as sanctuary cities "because of the abandonment of Americans values, ideals and cultural destiny" under Trump. Chicago has been a sanctuary city since 2012 after Emanuel announced the Welcoming City Ordinance that offers protections for immigrants living in the country illegally.
"What President Trump fails to understand is that America is a sanctuary country," Emanuel said in the statement. "Chicago will always be a welcoming city; immigrants of all faiths, nationalities and ethnicities help make Chicago the most American of American cities."

Texto completo: The Secret Service detained a man outside the White House on Friday afternoon after he apparently attempted to light himself on fire.

A Secret Service spokeswoman confirmed the man had tried to set his jacket on fire, and the D.C. Fire Department responded to administer first aid. No information about the man's condition or reason for setting himself on fire was immediately available.

The identity of the man was not released. It appears only one person was involved in the incident.

Authorities removed reporters, who were gathered on the driveway, from the area following the incident. Most were guided back into the West Wing.


"Someone apparently set himself on fire in front of the White House just now. I was coming out of the West Wing, and the Secret Service isn’t letting anyone out onto Pennsylvania Ave. They say there are also suspicious packages," reported Nicholas Kristof, of the New York Times, via Twitter.

Texto completo: In a significant escalation of the criminal case against Michael Avenatti, the brash lawyer known for representing Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Trump, federal prosecutors in California announced on Thursday that he had been indicted on three dozen counts.
The authorities accused Mr. Avenatti of stealing millions of dollars from five clients and of lying repeatedly about his business and income -- not just to clients but also to an I.R.S. collection agent, creditors, a bankruptcy court and a bankruptcy trustee.
Mr. Avenatti was indicted by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana, Calif., on the new charges, which included tax fraud and bankruptcy fraud, adding to charges of wire fraud, bank fraud and extortion that were filed against him last month in California and New York. If convicted of all the crimes of which he has been accused in California alone, prosecutors said, he would face a maximum of 333 years in prison, and an additional two-year mandatory sentence on an identity theft charge.
"It is lawyer 101: You do not steal your client's money," Nicola T. Hanna, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, said at a news conference Thursday, describing Mr. Avenatti's business as a Ponzi scheme of sorts. "Money generated from one set of crimes was used to further other crimes, typically in the form of payments used to string along victims so as to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing."
Mr. Avenatti denied all of the allegations on Thursday. He has suggested that the case against him is politically motivated, following his aggressive representation of Ms. Daniels, the pornographic film actress who said she had a sexual relationship with President Trump and received a hush-money payment in October 2016. (Two suits that Mr. Avenatti brought on behalf of Ms. Daniels against Mr. Trump have been dismissed.)
"This case is based on the facts and the documents," Mr. Hanna said Thursday, noting that the charges stemmed from an inquiry by the I.R.S.'s criminal investigation division that dated to September 2016, before Mr. Trump was elected and well before Mr. Avenatti began representing Ms. Daniels.
Among the five clients Mr. Avenatti is accused of defrauding across four matters, prosecutors said, one was a paraplegic man, Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, who won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County four years ago but had received only "a fraction of the money" through periodic payments that never exceeded $1,900.
"Mr. Avenatti stole millions of dollars that were meant to compensate Mr. Johnson for a devastating injury, spent it on his own lavish lifestyle, then lied about it to Mr. Johnson for years to cover his tracks," Josh Robbins, a lawyer for Mr. Johnson, said Thursday. "His actions have left Mr. Johnson destitute."
Mr. Avenatti lied to clients about having received a total of more than $12 million in settlement payments, a share of which he would have been entitled to keep for his work, prosecutors said. He told clients the money had not yet arrived or, in one case, that he had already forwarded the funds to the client. He paid out small portions of what was owed to the clients, calling those payments "advances on the settlement," prosecutors said.
Mr. Avenatti put most of the client money toward his own expenses, the authorities said, including a $5 million private jet that he co-owned, which prosecutors said they had seized on Wednesday. In the purchase of that aircraft, according to the charging documents unsealed Thursday, Mr. Avenatti used $2.5 million of a client's $3 million settlement, paid in 2017, while he told the client that the settlement would be paid in installments over eight years.
In other instances, the indictment said, he put client money toward paying personal legal expenses, paying creditors after his firm had filed for bankruptcy, and paying costs associated with a coffee company he owned.
He also dodged taxes, some that he owed himself and others that were owed by his firm, prosecutors said. They alleged that Mr. Avenatti had lied to an I.R.S. revenue officer and had taken steps to prevent the government from collecting on tax liens and levies since 2013.
Though from 2015 to 2017 he withheld taxes from the paychecks of employees at the coffee company he owned -- Global Baristas, which ran Tully's coffee stores -- Mr. Avenatti failed to pay more than $3 million in payroll taxes to the government, prosecutors said. They accused him of trying to obstruct the government's efforts to collect nearly $5 million in unpaid payroll taxes and penalties by routing coffee-company money to different bank accounts, including one associated with a car-racing company he owned.
"As the tax filing season comes to an end, the indictment filed today sends a clear message," Ryan Korner, the acting special agent in charge of the I.R.S.'s Criminal Investigation division in Los Angeles, said Thursday. "We will investigate all individuals, including high-profile attorneys who violate the tax laws."
At the time of Thursday's announcement, Mr. Avenatti was out on $300,000 bail after having been arrested late last month in New York, where he was accused of demanding millions from Nike's lawyers while threatening to reveal what he has described as improper payments to college basketball recruits by the sportswear giant. He is due to answer to the new charges against him on April 29 in federal court in Santa Ana.
"I intend to fully fight all charges and plead not guilty," Mr. Avenatti said on Twitter after the new charges in California were announced. "I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me."
"For 20 years, I have represented Davids vs. Goliaths and relied on due process and our system of justice," he said. "Along the way, I have made many powerful enemies. I am entitled to a full presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once all of the facts are known."
Mr. Avenatti, 48, was a fixture on cable news as an antagonist to Mr. Trump as Ms. Daniels's case played out. He and Ms. Daniels parted ways this year, and his firm again filed for bankruptcy last month. Even since he was first charged last month, he has turned to the news media to mount his defense.
"I can take a tremendous amount of punishment and keep going," he told The New York Times days after he was arrested. "Anytime you're charged with any felony you have to take it seriously, and I'm concerned about it," he said, quickly adding: "The government has me in their cross-hairs, and there are reasons for that."
He declined to explain what exactly he meant by that.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

New York City Women in the House (of Representatives)

Texto completo: If you've seen media coverage of the 29-year-old first-year representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it would be easy to think that she's the first of her kind. Democrats and Republicans alike appear to be in a perpetual state of slack-jawed bewilderment as they watch her stand up to powerful lobbyists, stomp on shibboleths and clap back at her trolls on Twitter.
But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez would be the first to tell you that she hails from a long line of defiant, outspoken congresswomen from New York. (And, of course, they aren't just New Yorkers; Lori Lightfoot is preparing to be the first African-American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago's mayor, running largely as an outsider candidate.) As the saying goes, history never repeats itself, but it often rhymes.
The story is in the photos from The New York Times archive. Beginning with Ruth Baker Pratt, who won her house seat in 1929, a series of New York women would fight their way onto Capitol Hill, defying expectations and breaking down barriers. Next came Edna Kelly, Brooklyn's first congresswoman, who, among other things, helped establish the principle of equal pay for equal work.
The 1970s ushered in a golden age of congresswomen from New York. There was the inimitable Bella Abzug, the lawyer and civil rights activist who served three loud, proud terms from 1971 to 1977 for New York's 19th District. "I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine," she once wrote, "and knock the crap out of the political power structure." One can only wonder what she would have done with Instagram Live and 280-character tweets.
Gov. Mario Cuomo said of Ms. Abzug in 1998, "She was a New Yorker, and for a New Yorker, any day without a really good fight is regarded as a lost opportunity." He was right: Whether navigating the A train or pushing through rush hour traffic in Midtown, you can't make it in New York without learning to throw a few elbows. The same goes for stepping into a national political arena dominated and designed by men.
Time and again, women candidates have been met with derision or dismissed as "long shots" -- in many cases, both. Take Elizabeth Holtzman: In 1972, the then-31-year-old stunned the whole of Washington when she upset a powerful 50-year male incumbent in the Democratic primary, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. (Sound familiar?)
And, of course, you can't talk about women in politics without talking about Shirley Chisholm, a once-in-a-generation force for change who represented her Brooklyn district from 1969 to 1983. As she put it, "My greatest political asset, which professional politicians fear, is my mouth, out of which come all kinds of things one shouldn't always discuss for reasons of political expediency." Despite her fearlessness -- or, more aptly, because of it -- opponents dismissed her, she said, as just a "little schoolteacher." (She had been an educator before taking office.)
There is a counterintuitive advantage in being the underdog, though, and New York women have a long record of turning their challenging positioning into a superpower.
That takes a balancing act: Be attractive, but not too attractive. Smile, but be taken seriously. Get things done, but never appear threatening. And those expectations are compounded for women of color.
Just think about the kinds of photo-ops women in public life are asked to pose for -- baking pies, tending a garden, etc. -- and the way they subvert them to hit back at the male power structure. Look closely at the above photo of Geraldine Ferraro (who served in the House from 1979 to 1985) and you'll see the words "Clean up politics. Elect women." emblazoned on her apron. Or Representative Susan Molinari gamely standing tall on a booster next to Chuck Schumer during a television taping. These photos have a kind of cheeky strength. But looking at them, I can only wonder what private costs these women faced as they made space for the rest of us to follow in the public sphere.
One thing that is clear: These New York women never let narrow notions of what a leader should look like stop them from getting things done.
And get things done, they did. In 1972, Ms. Chisholm was the first woman of any color and the first African-American to make a serious run for president on a major-party ticket. She also co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus with Ms. Abzug and a host of others. And Ms. Holtzman sat on the House Judiciary Committee as it presided over the Watergate investigation in 1974. In 1984, Ms. Ferraro was the first female vice-presidential candidate and sponsored the Economic Equity Act in 1981, a bill that helped strengthen the financial rights of widows and divorcées, and permitted homemakers to save with individual retirement accounts.
In both image and impact, these women are gritty, determined. But the photos that strike me most are the ones in which tenderness and honest vulnerability are on display. You see it in Ms. Chisholm's unvarnished joy as she waves from a car window while campaigning, in Ms. Holtzman's satisfied and knowing smile, and in the warmth with which Nydia Velázquez, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, embraces her father.
These images are also a powerful reminder: Thriving in a world created for men doesn't have to mean shying away from all that makes you a woman. When criticized for talking about her signature red lipstick, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez put it this way: "I derive power from my femininity. And any attempt to make femininity trivial or unimportant is an attempt to take away my power." In the face of a white and male majority ready to cast anything feminine as frivolous, this small act is itself a kind of defiant rebellion.
Is it any wonder New York produces the kind of women who are defined by their nerve? As a native New Yorker and the product of New York City public schools, I know that this city forces you to face each day with bravery -- or you'll never make it onto a crowded subway car intact.
What's more, each new generation of New York women inherits the legacy of those who came before. Our streets are stamped with the heel prints of women who were never expected to succeed but did anyway. Just look at the unlikely stories of Ms. Chisholm, Ms. Holtzman, Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Just look at the women that charge by you on any given city block, who strenuously hoist strollers up subway staircases, and who give you a piece of their mind whether you like it or not. Just look at the girls gathering in tight circles on a city playground, sharing secrets -- and building their plans for world domination.
Audrey Gelman is the chief executive officer and co-founder of The Wing, a network of work and community spaces designed for women with locations in New York City, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles. Ms. Gelman previously served as deputy communications director for Comptroller Scott Stringer's campaign and is a native New Yorker.

The 12 Best Cookbooks of Spring

Texto completo: 'Aloha Kitchen: Recipes From Hawai'i'
When you think of Hawaii, you may imagine white sand beaches and palm trees. Those are nice, but a freshly fried malasada and a spam musubi are better. "Aloha Kitchen" (Ten Speed, $30) delves deep into the comforting flavors of Hawaiian cuisine, with a chapter devoted to culinary regions of influence. Alana Kysar, who has a popular food blog, Fix Feast Flair, grew up in Hawaii but is not ethnically Hawaiian; she explains how terrified she was to write a book that encompassed the stories and history of her favorite place in the world. But she did, and her love and respect for her home come alive on every page. If that doesn't convince you, the pink guava cake will. KIERA WRIGHT-RUIZ
Recipes: Loco Moco | Spam Musubi | Hawaiian Guava Cake
'Black Sea: Dispatches and Recipes, Through Darkness and Light'
I was immediately drawn to "Black Sea" (Hardie Grant, $35); its author, Caroline Eden, also wrote "Samarkand," another cookbook with a strong infusion of history and culture that I loved. The Black Sea has had strategic importance since ancient times, and remains a gateway to the Mediterranean. But, as its waters lap the shores of many countries, the sea also provides a way of understanding the region's diverse and compelling menu. Star billing goes to Romania, especially the coastal city Constanta, with a summery raspberry buttermilk tart, and to Bulgaria, too, known for dishes like blackened peppers with feta, tarragon and mint, and a quiche-like zelnik pie with Swiss chard and feta. Istanbul is prominent, but the Turkish cities of Safranbolu and Trabzon contribute dishes like warm strawberries heated with chiles and cooled with yogurt that are worth adding to the summer repertory.

'Every Day Is Saturday: Recipes and Strategies for Easy Cooking, Every Day of the Week'
Sarah Copeland knows exactly who her new cookbook, "Every Day Is Saturday" (Chronicle, $29.95), is for. If you graze at Sweetgreen, sip at Stumptown and thrill to ideas like farm shares, alternative milks and good fats -- but haven't managed to incorporate that way of eating into your home -- this book is for you. The title refers to Ms. Copeland's conviction that the pleasures of weekend cooking are transferable to weekday meals. Maybe, but she does provide tasty, real-world recipes, like one-pot pasta with spring vegetables and instant smoky black beans for taco night. They are informed by her time as food director of Real Simple magazine, as a restaurant chef and as a parent of two young children. (She is also a New York Times contributor.) Without losing track of deliciousness, she cuts the cream in mushroom soup with puréed beans, the white flour in cookies with almond flour, and the butter in banana bread with coconut oil. It's a worthy primer on modern, healthy family cooking. JULIA MOSKIN
'Indian-ish: Recipes and Antics From a Modern American Family'
The food writer (and New York Times contributor) Priya Krishna wrote "Indian-ish" (Houghton Mifflin, $28) with her mother, Ritu Krishna, an executive at a software company who taught herself how to cook after moving from India to the United States. Ritu developed many of the recipes in this entertaining book, which is filled with Indian-American mashups like roti pizza, saag paneer made with feta, and Indian ribollita. Tomato rice with crispy Cheddar, or "pizza rice" as they call it in the Krishna family, is a pleasantly addictive rice-cheese-tomato casserole that gets a little kick from Indian green chile. Garlic-ginger-cilantro-mint chicken is a riot of flavors and colors, much like the rest of this pop-art-illustrated book. It is a joy to cook from, and just as much fun to read. MARGAUX LASKEY

'La Grotta: Ice Creams and Sorbets'
Not all who wander are lost. Before starting her company, La Grotta Ices, in London, Kitty Travers traveled extensively, apprenticing in kitchens and eventually becoming the pastry chef at Fergus Henderson's restaurant St. John Bread and Wine. In her joyful, quirky cookbook, "La Grotta" (Clarkson Potter, $25), she pairs simple custards and sorbets with unconventional and sophisticated flavors, like green walnut and blood peach. Others combine common ingredients in uncommon ways, like cucumber and sour cream, uniting fresh and tart. Peach is vibrant (almost loud!) and set in a creamy custard; a mango sorbet crisp, amplified by lime. For less adventurous palates, she includes classic flavors, like pistachio, mint chip and Swiss vanilla. But the world is so large. Why stop there? KRYSTEN CHAMBROT
'My Mexico City Kitchen: Recipes and Convictions'
At her Mexico City restaurant Contramar, the chef Gabriela Cámara serves a dramatic butterflied snapper, a dish originally created to please a variety of tastes at home. One side of the fish is red, stained with a fiery paste of cascabel, ancho and guajillo chiles. The other side is green and mellow, flavored with parsley and garlic. In "My Mexico City Kitchen" (Lorena Jones, $35), written with Malena Watrous, Ms. Cámara is a precise but unfussy teacher, showing readers exactly how to build this pescado a la talla, from the red adobo to the raw salsa verde to the supremely creamy refried beans, and jumping just as easily from the topics of recycling leftovers to general taco theory. In her creative, pleasure-driven kitchen, anything can become a taco. TEJAL RAO
'Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables'
Things in my kitchen have changed since "Ruffage" (Chronicle, $35) arrived. I have become a poacher of radishes and a shaver of cauliflower. I have even considered cooking sunchokes. I credit Abra Berens, a chef at Granor Farm near the Michigan-Indiana border, who built the book she wished she had when she was running a small farm 10 years ago. This organized, easygoing guide to 29 vegetables offers a few cooking methods for each one, supplemented by several variations. Shaved raw cauliflower becomes the base for a salad with whitefish, lemon and radicchio, or one with dates, chile oil and parsley. Toss roasted cauliflower with yogurt, dried cherries and pecans, or purée it with white wine and onion to make a base for a pork cutlet or salmon with orange zest. KIM SEVERSON
'Simple Cake: All You Need to Keep Your Friends and Family in Cake'
The premise of "Simple Cake" (Ten Speed, $23) is a lovely one: It aims to make baking a cake the kind of thing you do to celebrate life's little moments as well as the big ones, from a lost tooth to a milestone birthday. The author, Odette Williams, divided her book into three chapters -- cakes, toppings and ways to combine them -- that prompt readers to come up with their own variations. The milk and honey cake is delightful on its own, but cover it with lemony mascarpone icing and it's dinner party fare. Or drizzle condensed milk, evaporated milk and heavy cream over a chocolate sheet cake and top it with cinnamon whipped cream for a showstopper inspired by tres leches cake. This book is perfect for newlyweds, a new parent or anyone looking to make new traditions. MARGAUX LASKEY

'Tu Casa Mi Casa: Mexican Recipes for the Home Cook'
Enrique Olvera may be Mexico's most renowned chef, but in his latest cookbook, he is the voice whispering encouragements as you make tamales, chilaquiles and chicken tinga at home. "Tu Casa Mi Casa" (Phaidon, $39.95), written with Luis Arellano, Gonzalo Goût and Daniela Soto-Innes, has a few big projects, though most of the book is filled with weeknight recipes, many vegetarian and gluten-free, like a vibrant green mole made with pistachios, chiles and fresh herbs, and a refreshing avocado and lemon agua fresca. Every household has one or two salsa recipes that "is theirs and theirs alone," Mr. Olvera writes. With his help, you will soon have one, too. SARA BONISTEEL

'Vietnamese Food Any Day: Simple Recipes for True, Fresh Flavors'
From how to make the richest beef broth for pho to how to properly fry cha gio (imperial rolls), nearly everything I know about Vietnamese food I learned from the writer Andrea Nguyen. In her previous books, the focus was on guiding the cook through traditional Vietnamese dishes. But she shifts gears in her latest book, "Vietnamese Food Any Day"(Ten Speed, $24.99), focusing on home cooking using supermarket ingredients and weeknight-fast techniques. Richly flavored but simple recipes dominate the pages, with versions of Vietnamese classics alongside Ms. Nguyen's more modern takes. In her pomegranate Sriracha shrimp, tangy pomegranate molasses stands in for harder-to-find tamarind concentrate, lending pungency to the sweet shellfish. And her garlic umami noodles are a revelation -- complex, tangy and deeply buttery, and all made in one pan. MELISSA CLARK

'Where Cooking Begins: Uncomplicated Recipes to Make You a Great Cook'
Carla Lalli Music, the food director of Bon Appétit magazine, is like everyone's favorite aunt, the one who shows up and makes surprising things happen. Her superpower is that she believes in you as a cook; her new book, "Where Cooking Begins" (Clarkson Potter, $32.50), is her 250-page argument that you should believe in yourself, too. She helps with the first steps, like stocking a pantry and learning an all-purpose pastry dough. When it's time for recipes, Aunt Carla might invent something delicious, like tahini butter on sweet potatoes or Parmesan-garlic croutons, or using crushed potato chips as a garnish -- or something weird, like stir-fried celery with bacon and peanuts, and a ham sandwich with string beans on it. Either way, you want to be in the kitchen with her. JULIA MOSKIN
'Zaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen'
The British writer Yasmin Khan first explored Palestinian cuisine while she was working in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for a human rights organization, and later amassed recipes and stories by speaking and eating with Palestinians in their home kitchens. "Zaitoun" (W.W. Norton & Company, $29.95) invites readers to explore bountiful mazzeh (or mezze) like crunchy pickles, creamy bowls of labneh, raw and cooked vegetables and Arabian flatbreads to scoop them all up, as well as spice-laden dishes like sumac roast chicken and mansaf, a Bedouin lamb dish served at Palestinian weddings and celebrations. The political purpose here is transparent: Ms. Khan named the book after the Arabic word for olive, a prominent ingredient in Palestinian cooking and a worldwide symbol of peace. ALEXA WEIBEL

Barr says Mueller played no role in drafting Russia report summary

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday that special counsel Robert Mueller did not help him draft a four-page summary of the Russia investigation final report.

The revelation came during a House Appropriations panel hearing on the proposed Justice Department budget, which Democrats quickly refocused on the Mueller investigation.

“Attorney General Barr, in your confirmation hearings you said you believed it was very important that the results of the Special Counsel’s report be shared with the public. We agree on that," said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., the chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing. "With regard to your March 24 and March 29 letters to the Judiciary Committee, did anyone on Special Counsel Mueller or anyone on his team have a role in drafting them or reviewing them in advance? Did you use any of the summary documents prepared by the special counsel in drafting these documents?”

Barr said in both instances he didn't think Mueller's team was involved.

“The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller's team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that," Barr said. "The letter on the 29th, I don't believe that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter."

Democrats have accused Barr of trying to hide damning information about President Trump from Mueller's Russia investigation under the guise of redactions.

Further adding fuel to their ire were reports last week in the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Barr portrayed the findings of their years-long investigation in a four-page summary. Reacting to those reports, Trump tore into Mueller's team on Sunday, accusing the "angry Democrats" of "illegally leaking" information to the media.

Barr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's roughly 400-page report to Congress last month which said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The summary also said Mueller did not find Trump committed obstruction of justice, but Mueller also did not exonerate the president. However, Barr said he concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a crime.

In a follow-up letter on March 29, Barr identified four categories of information that will not be made public, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations — including those referred by the special counsel’s office to other offices — and material that would “unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”

Although Barr said he is working with Mueller to release a redacted version of the final report for Congress to read this month, the Judiciary Committee, ruled by Democrats, voted last week in favor of subpoenaing Barr to turn over the entire Mueller report.

However, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Tuesday his panel will not actually issue a subpoena for Mueller's full report until they see the redacted version provided by Barr.

Texto completo: Allison Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville” sobre Superman, se declaró ayer culpable de crimen organizado en el caso de la secta Nxivm, cuyos dirigentes están acusados de tráfico y esclavitud sexual en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y de conspiración, pero aún tienen pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
“He llegado a la conclusión de que debo asumir toda la responsabilidad sobre mi conducta y es por eso que me declaro culpable hoy”, dijo la actriz, citada por el medio Hollywoodlife.
Mack se encontraba en libertad condicional desde el año pasado, así como Clare Bronfman (40), una de las herederas del conglomerado de licores tradicionalmente conocido como Seagram’s.
El supuesto líder del grupo, Keith Raniere (58), es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Mack también pidió perdón a su familia y a todas aquellas personas que hirió por su “adherencia equivocada a las enseñanzas de Keith Reniere”, líder de la secta, reseñó EFE.
Según la fiscalía, la actriz recibió beneficios financieros a cambio de reclutar esclavas sexuales para Reniere.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación.
Otras acusadas son su hija Lauren Salzman y Kathy Russel.
Según la acusación, Nxivm formaba parte de un entramado piramidal formado por varias entidades. Entre los crímenes de los que se les acusan están “robo de identidad, extorsión, trabajos forzados, tráfico sexual, lavado de dinero, fraude y obstrucción a la justicia”.
Raniere exigía a su círculo cercano una lealtad absoluta.
Raniere llevaba dos décadas impulsando supuestos programas de autoayuda bajo la empresa paraguas Nxivm, de la que era fundador y que abarcaba centros operativos en Estados Unidos, México, Canadá y varios países de Suramérica.
En el año 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes” o “El voto”, donde era el único hombre y el líder, mientras que Mack era “una de las mujeres en el primer nivel de la pirámide, inmediatamente después” de él.
DOS operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”, y se esperaba de estas últimas que reclutaran a otras nuevas.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Texto completo: En el juicio de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera hubo varias revelaciones sobre la operación del Cártel de Sinaloa, homicidios, traiciones y un largo etcétera, pero hubo temas que no fueron tratados en la Corte de Brooklyn, debido a limitantes que fiscales federales lograron, ya que podrían afectar a sus cooperantes.
También los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa tuvieron que acceder a que alguna información fuera retenida, como la supuesta compra de menores por parte del mexicano para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas .
Esa historia se hizo pública a pocos días de que el juicio terminara, lo que incluso desató una polémica con los miembros del jurado, quienes afirmaron no haber leído al respecto en internet, debido a que una de las reglas que se les impuso era no buscar historias sobre Guzmán Loera en redes sociales o cualquier página en la web.
Tras una batalla legal de abogados de VICE News y del New York Times, algunos documentos serán liberados, como uno hecho público hace unos días, donde se indica que Alex Cifuentes , ubicado como W1 (Testigo 1) era un testigo complicado, debido a sus creencias y práticas esotéricas.
Cifuentes, quien vivió con Guzmán Loera en las montañas de Sinaloa, creía en la brujería, además de tener “creencias poco ortodoxas “, innecesarias para el caso, consideraron los fiscales.
El colombiano, quien acusó que su exsocio pagó $100 millones de dólares al expresidente Enrique Peña Nieto , podría haber sido descalificado también por creer en los extraterrestres y de que habría un apocalipsis en el 2012 .
También creía en los Illuminati, la masonería y otras teorías de conspiración que afectarían su testimonio ante el jurado y la opinión pública, ya que fue quien reveló el estilo de vida de Guzmán Loera, cómo escapó de las montañas, explicó su círculo de seguridad, los negocios de drogas con socios de Colombia y Ecuados y la apertura de nuevos mercados, como el de Canadá.

NY bills target Trump returns

Texto completo: ALBANY — Some New York Democrats think they have a new way to get at President Donald Trump's tax returns.
A bill introduced Monday by a Democratic senator would allow the state tax department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Holyman, D-Manhattan, said the measure would be a way to assist the Democratic-controlled House in its efforts to review the president's state returns, which would have a bevy of information since Trump and his businesses are based in New York.
"Americans deserve to know whether the person who sits in the highest office of the land has conflicts or potential conflicts of interest," Holyman said Monday.
The bill is latest attempt by Democrats in the state Legislature to try to find a way to compel the president to release his state taxes.
The proposal would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request from the state Department of Taxation and Finance the president's federal tax returns.
The New York bill comes after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., last week asked the IRS to release six years of Trump's tax returns by April 10. But the Trump administration has resisted.
White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday called the efforts by Democrats a "political stunt."
He said the issue of Trump's tax returns "was already litigated during the election."
"Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy," Mulvaney said on "Fox News Sunday."
Some New York Democrats believe they are in a unique position to pass a state law that would force the release of Trump's state taxes because he is a New Yorker.
Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-Manhattan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told The New York Times the New York bill would be helpful.
"The state return, presumably, has to match the federal return," he said, adding, "It just makes the work of the federal committee, that has a legitimate reason to look into this, a little easier to see the complete picture."
Holyman has helped introduced three bills in New York to try to get Trump's state taxes.
The latest had yet to get an Assembly sponsor.
One measure, called the NY TRUTH Act, would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year.
Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes, a bill similar to ones being considered in other states, including New Jersey, where it passed but was vetoed by then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally.
So far in New York, though, none of the bills has been successful. Yet there is renewed hope this year because Democrats control the state Legislature; Republicans had held the Senate majority for the past eight years.

Texto completo: LONDON -- "The Inheritance," a two-part, six-and-a-half-hour play about the legacy of AIDS in New York, dominated the Olivier Awards on Sunday night, winning four trophies at the British equivalent of the Tony Awards.
At the Royal Albert Hall in London, the play, by Matthew Lopez, won best new play, best director for Stephen Daldry, best actor for Kyle Soller, and best lighting design for Jon Clark.
It beat strong competition, including "The Lehman Trilogy," the acclaimed family saga about the founders of the financial firm, which is playing at the Park Avenue Armory until April 20, and "Sweat," Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play set in working-class Pennsylvania.
Mr. Lopez said in an interview that he hoped "The Inheritance" would transfer to Broadway, especially given the play's setting. "We've seen a lot of Brits come over and take home Tonys, so I think it's only fair really," Mr. Lopez said, when asked about the play's success.
"The Inheritance" received rave reviews in Britain after opening last year at London's Young Vic. Dominic Cavendish, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it "a theatrical marathon that instantly looks like a modern classic," adding that it was "perhaps the most important American play of the century so far."
The play "pierces your emotional defenses, raises any number of political issues and enfolds you in its narrative," wrote Michael Billington in The Guardian.
It had been nominated for eight awards, the most for any play.
Mr. Soller, in his acceptance speech, referred to a new law in Brunei that makes gay sex between men punishable by death. "For those that continue the fight in a world where you can still be stoned to death for loving who you love, thank you," said the London-based American actor.
Last week, numerous celebrities, citing the law, called for a boycott against hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei. Those include the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles and the Dorchester in London.
The success of "The Inheritance" was matched by only two musicals: a gender-swapping version of Stephen Sondheim's "Company," and "Come From Away," the musical about residents of a small Canadian town who had to accommodate 6,700 travelers whose planes were diverted there after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
"Company," which won best musical revival, was one of the most acclaimed productions in London last year. The New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley wrote that the decision to replace its original male lead with a woman gave the musical "emotional coherence and clout that it never possessed in my previous experiences of the show."
Marianne Elliott, the musical's director, thanked Mr. Sondheim in her acceptance speech for being "so open to allowing us to meddle with this piece" and believing "that theater could change and evolve and should be of and for the times."
Ms. Elliott said in an interview later that she had no idea if it would transfer to New York but hoped it would.
"Come From Away" won best new musical despite receiving less positive reviews in London than it did when it opened on Broadway in 2017.
The other success story of the night was a revival of Tennessee Williams's 1948 play "Summer and Smoke," which initially showed at the Almeida Theater. It won best revival for a play and best actress for Patsy Ferran.
Ms. Ferran beat Gillian Anderson and Sophie Okonedo for the prize, cementing her reputation as a rising star in London theater. Reviewing the play for The Times, Matt Wolf praised her performance, writing that she was "a child-woman teetering on the abyss of tragedy."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire, according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr. Deripaska.
The deal, announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details, included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10.5 million shares of Mr. Deripaska's main holding company, EN+, to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife, Polina Yumasheva.
The couple divorced last year, and their settlement, which called for him to provide funds for their children, was finalized before Mr. Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018, according to representatives of the Treasury Department, Mr. Deripaska and EN+.
The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department. He said in a letter sent late last month to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, that the transfer of the EN+ shares -- which had a value of more than $78 million at the close of business on Monday -- "constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children," and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal.
The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies -- including Mr. Deripaska, EN+ and the giant aluminum company it controls, Rusal -- for their affiliations with a Russian government that "engages in a range of malign activity around the globe," including election interference, Mr. Mnuchin said at the time.
When the Treasury Department announced the deal with Mr. Deripaska's companies to lift the sanctions, it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions, and said that Mr. Deripaska would not personally benefit. As part of the deal, he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership, with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access.
But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia, and unsuccessfully tried to block it from going into effect. Those concerns were inflamed further when it was revealed that the confidential, legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr. Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN+.
The agreement specified that 1.64 percent of the shares of EN+ would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation, for which there was no easily traceable public record. After receiving inquiries from journalists, EN+ officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr. Deripaska's children.
But when asked by Mr. Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement, Mr. Mnuchin said of Mr. Deripaska that "his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief."
A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin's statement last week, saying that "Deripaska's children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions."
Larissa Belyaeva, a spokeswoman for Mr. Deripaska, said in a statement that he "disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares."
She added, "Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre-existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement."
She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department.
Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr. Deripaska. They include his charitable foundation, his former wife, her father and a family-linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited, as well as shares being transferred to VTB, a Russian government-owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr. Deripaska large sums of money.
And in a rare interview late last month, Mr. Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi, "It's a small portion of the shares. And it was part of my settlement with my wife, which was set long before."
Last month, Mr. Deripaska sued the Treasury Department and its officials, including Mr. Mnuchin, to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally, claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him "radioactive" in international business circles.
In the interview with The New York Times, he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has "a popular brand in the U.S."
He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions. In announcing the sanctions, the department had noted that "Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state."
Mr. Deripaska explained the statement to mean that "it was just who I am."
"I am Russian," he said. "And unfortunately, I was sanctioned because I am Russian."
He added, "I'm not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club, a football club, to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country. I spend most of my time here. My kids are here. And my future also will be in Russia."

Trump wants a DHS chief willing to break the law. Lawmakers must block a nominee who would

Texto completo: It’s no secret that President Trump opposes immigration — what else could he possibly mean by his pronouncement that the country is full? But aside from wielding policies aimed to deter illegal immigration with cruelty, he has also repeatedly floated measures that are illegal under both domestic and international law.

Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will be remembered mostly for her defense of Trump’s policy of family separations and the spiraling problems at the border. But in the wake of her resignation on Sunday, leaks to the New York Times show that she refused to bow to illegal demands from the White House. That should not be lost on the Senate during the confirmation hearings for her replacement — if and when Trump sees fit to appoint someone to fill the position.

Trump reportedly demanded that Nielsen not only impose new practices for processing asylum claims, but actually stop taking applications all together. This would be illegal. Under U.S. law, individuals are allowed to apply for asylum even if they have crossed the border illegally. These applicants are also entitled to have their claims processed by an established legal process that considers the merits of their claims. That U.S. law forecloses attempts by the executive to rewrite asylum policy was affirmed in December 2018, when a federal judge struck down an attempt by the Trump administration to limit what could be considered grounds for asylum.

Moreover, the U.S. is bound to honor the right of individuals to apply for asylum as a signatory of both the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Those agreements codify Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which reads: "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution."

Senate Republicans must make clear to Trump that there will be no support in the Senate for a candidate who is willing to bend the laws to fulfill his demands, nor, one would hope, for one who would champion policies like family separation that Republicans themselves roundly criticized last year.

HOSPITALS HEAD TO THE HILL TO PUSH OBAMACARE EXPANSION, FIGHT MEDICARE FOR ALL: Hospital groups in town this week to lobby Congress are focusing on expanding the Affordable Care Act while batting back liberal proposals to extend Medicare to more people.

American Hospital Association president Rick Pollack , speaking at the group’s meeting Monday morning in downtown Washington, took a shot at Democrats who want to expand Medicare to more people — whether by enrolling everyone in a government plan or letting more people have the option of buying into the program.

“More patients on Medicare would strain hospitals even more and threaten their survival,” Pollack said. The Democratic proposals, he said, would threaten innovation and disrupt coverage for the people who receive private health insurance through their jobs.

Pollack proposed an alternative: Building off of the Affordable Care Act. He listed priorities such as more funding to insurers in the form of reinsurance so they can keep premiums down, boosting subsidies so they’ll go to more people, and funding more advertising and help for people to enroll in coverage. Pollack criticized “cheaper plans with skimpy benefits,” that the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress support.

“Rather than ‘Medicare for all’ we need to build on the ACA,” Pollack said. “We need a ‘BCA’ or a pathway to Better Care for America.”

That wording is similar to the “Better Deal” slogan that Democrats have used and the “Better Way” slogan from House Republicans.

Despite the rhetorical support for “Medicare for all” from Democratic presidential candidates and high-profile progressives, the actual policymaking in the Democratic-controled House has been in favor of the healthcare industry.

Much of what Pollack listed in his opening remarks is being addressed in the Democratic package being advanced quickly through the House. The one item missing from the list of hospital industry requests, however, is allowing direct payments to insurers, known as cost-sharing reduction subsidies, to start again. The payments are still flowing, because insurers are charging the federal government more in subsidies to make up the difference, but the Trump administration has proposed banning that arrangement.

Hospitals are powerful opponents to Medicare expansion because they are the largest employer in many districts. Hospitals are rarely targets of Democratic ire when they talk about addressing medical spending, even though they make up the largest share of healthcare costs. When politicians talk about taking on the industry, they tend to point the finger at pharmaceutical companies and insurers, but the hospital industry would be affected by legislation addressing both of these areas.

PMBS PREPARE TO FACE CONGRESS OVER DRUG PRICES: Pharmacy Benefit Managers, the middlemen that negotiate drug prices, will face lawmakers in two separate hearings this week to push back on the narrative from the pharmaceutical industry that they are responsible for high drug prices and for not passing discounts onto patients. First, executives from top companies CVS Health, OptumRx, and Express Scripts will face the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, and on Wednesday they will address questions about the high cost of insulin before the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.

Comments are due Monday on PBM rule: Public comments must be submitted by Monday regarding the proposal that the Trump administration put forward to force PBMs to pass on drug savings to patients who are covered by Medicare and Medicaid managed care. PBMs have warned that the arrangement would cause premiums to increase.

MULVANEY SAYS HEALTHCARE PLAN COMING SOON: White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told “Fox News Sunday” that the Trump administration would have a healthcare plan ready before the presidential election, saying, “We want to run on this.”

The White House met this weekend with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma . “We talked about the individual marketplace, we talked about protecting Medicare, we talked about getting drug prices down, and I do think you’ll see a plan here fairly shortly,” Mulvaney said.

CONSERVATIVE DRUG CZAR DURING THE CRACK EPIDEMIC SAYS BIDEN TOLD HIM: ‘YOU’RE NOT BEING TOUGH ENOUGH’: William Bennett , a GOP designer of the "war on drugs" and the first U.S. drug czar, was a strong supporter of funding for law enforcement in the 1980s as the crack-cocaine epidemic raged on — and says that he wasn’t tough enough on drugs for Joe Biden . In 1988, he proposed an $8 billion national drug control strategy to tackle the problem through a combination of stricter policing, anti-drug education, and rehabilitation programs for drug users. But Senate Democrats, led by Biden as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, requested an additional $1 billion for the budget. Bennett said Biden wanted more money for law enforcement measures, including local police departments, criminal prosecutions, and prisons.

VERMONT SENATE APPROVES ABORTION-RIGHTS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT: The state Senate moved Proposal 5, a measure to write abortion-rights protections into the state constitution, to the House for consideration Thursday.

JORDAN AND MEADOWS WARN DRUG COMPANIES THAT CUMMINGS IS AFTER THEM: Reps. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., warned pharmaceutical companies that Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md., was coming after them in a partisan investigation. Meadows and Jordan sent 12 letters on Friday to pharmaceutical companies, alerting each to what they said was Cummings’ plans to “unilaterally release sensitive information” found by the Committee on Oversight and Reform about these companies.

CMS FINALIZES PLANS TO BRING TELEHEALTH TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE: CMS finalized policies Friday to expand telehealth care for Medicare Advantage plans. Starting in plan year 2020, the plans would offer patients the option to receive health care services from places like their homes, rather than requiring them to go to a healthcare facility.

NY JUDGE SAYS ROCKLAND COUNTY WILL NOT BAN UNVACCINATED CHILDREN FROM PUBLIC PLACES: A New York state judge has blocked Rockland County’s controversial ban barring unvaccinated children from being in public spaces and schools.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump volvió a presionar a México para que detenga inmigrantes que buscan llegar a los Estados Unidos.
El mandatario ha enviado mensajes encontrados sobre la actuación del Gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador en torno a los centroamericanos, ya que primero alabó la detención de inmigrantes, pero luego se quejó de lo opuesto.
El presidente Trump advirtió que el país “está lleno”, además de amenazar nuevamente con cerrar la frontera.
“México debe aprehender a todos los ilegales y no dejarlos que avancen hacia los Estados Unidos, o no tendremos otra opción que Cerrar la Frontera y/o establecer Impuestos” , escribió anoche el mandatario. “¡Nuestro País está LLENO!” .
….Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
El mensaje del republicano se dio apenas unas horas después de presionar a la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , de presentar su renuncia, tras una complicada reunión en la Casa Blanca, según reportes del New York Times y el Washington Post.
Previo a su nueva advertencia, el mandatario presumió las acciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza, al señalar que ha detenido a más inmigrantes que “en muchos años” e insistió sobre lo “lleno” que está el país, además de pedir nuevamente el endurecimiento de leyes, exigiendo a los demócratas sumarse a su petición.
“El sistema ha estado roto por muchos años. Los demócratas en el Congreso deben aceptar arreglar estas lagunas legales – No fronteras abiertas (crimen y drogas)” , tuiteó.
More apprehensions (captures)
at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes – No Open Borders (Crimes & Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
Desde la semana pasada, el presidente Trump ha enviado mensajes públicos a la Administración de López Obrador, quien no ha respondido directamente al respecto, pero el canciller Marcelo Ebrard afirma que México se mantendrá en su posición de respetar el Acuerdo de Marrakech , el cual aboga por la inmigración libre y ordenada. Este plan aprobado por las Naciones Unidas fue rechazado por Estados Unidos.
A pesar de las críticas del republicano a México, ese Gobierno aceptó recibir a inmigrantes que esperan una decisión en las cortes de EEUU sobre sus casos de asilo, un proyecto que Nielsen proyectó ampliar la semana pasada.

Texto completo: Though the first votes are still 10 months away, Democratic candidates for president are zigzagging across America as if Super Tuesday is almost upon them. The New York Times tracked the public appearances of eight Democrats for the month of March, as well as those private fund-raising events that could be found, to try to illuminate how they are spending their most precious resource: their time. The results reveal the often-opposing imperatives of running for president in 2020: fund-raising where the wealthiest Democrats live (chiefly in California and New York) vs. visiting the crucial early primary states; casting votes in Congress vs. introducing themselves to voters beyond the usual stomping grounds of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. As ever, Iowa, the first state to vote, remains the political and physical epicenter of the nomination process. But the candidates visited no fewer than 20 states in March as the geography of running for president has widened in search of money, votes and support. For Senator Bernie Sanders, the contest so far has involved the same kind of big rallies and speeches that defined his 2016 run. Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, has done the opposite: a flurry of voter interactions in smaller settings, hopping on cars in Nevada and coffee shop counters in Iowa, often driving himself between events. Mr. O'Rourke's dizzying itinerary appears an effort, in part, to emphasize his relative youth (he's 46). But it also displays an unusual potential advantage: being unemployed. Those who serve in Congress must fly back to Washington for votes, and other candidates must manage a city or a state. The travel patterns make plain just how much a constraint serving in the Senate can be, keeping candidates off the trail and confined to Washington for as many as four days a week. Several of the senators are also spending significant time at private fund-raisers. In March, Senators Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar all devoted days to such events, including time-consuming cross-country travel. But Senator Elizabeth Warren has made her refusal to attend private fund-raisers a core part of her message about a broken political system. Mr. Sanders avoids the fund-raising circuit, too. Mr. O'Rourke did so in his first 17 days, though he has not ruled out attending high-dollar events later. The itineraries also show just how many candidates appear to be banking on a lift from a strong showing in Iowa. Ms. Warren began and ended March in Iowa, with a total of nine events there, the most she held in any state. Iowa was also the most popular destination for Ms. Klobuchar, who hails from neighboring Minnesota. Of the eight candidates, only Ms. Harris, who held among the fewest public campaign events, did not visit Iowa in March, though she did go in February.
If most candidates seemed particularly focused on Iowa, Mr. Booker's three trips to the early primary state of South Carolina made plain its importance in his political strategy. He kept up a busy schedule of fund-raisers and public appearances, also traveling twice to California while stopping through Iowa and New Hampshire. Like Mr. O'Rourke, Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary, does not bear the burden of a day job. He made stops in the first four states, but he also held events in Texas, where his campaign is based, and in California -- two of the biggest prizes of the primary that will vote on the same day in March 2020. Ms. Gillibrand visited the first two states to vote -- Iowa and New Hampshire -- the most. She also held a kickoff rally in Manhattan and a televised town hall-style event in Michigan. She carved out time for a weekend of fund-raisers in both New York and California while balancing the need to be in Washington for Senate business. Ms. Harris mixed fund-raisers on both coasts with early-state appearances, though she forged a different travel path than others in March. She went to Florida to raise money. She was the only candidate with a public event in Georgia. And she was the only candidate included in the analysis not to appear in New Hampshire or Iowa last month.
Ms. Klobuchar made two trips to Iowa, touching down from Dubuque to Sioux City, and one trip to New Hampshire, as she also stopped through some of the usual destinations to raise money: New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois and California. She mixed in some public events, such as climate change round tables in Tampa and San Francisco, to her fund-raising trips. Mr. O'Rourke joined the contest in mid-March, and he raced through his first 10-plus days (including, literally, a 5K race in Iowa, which he finished in a respectable 24:29). He drove from Iowa to New Hampshire, making stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- a set of key Rust Belt states that Democrats lost in 2016. He ended the month with three kickoff rallies in Texas. Mr. Sanders began with rallies in Brooklyn and Chicago (where he grew up and went to college) and then methodically made his way through the first four states and California, with large-scale rallies anchoring each visit (he was not slowed by cutting his head on a glass shower door in South Carolina, which required stitches). He held no fund-raisers -- and no events in the last week of the month. The most interesting travel choice by Ms. Warren was to use a congressional recess to visit three states in the South not part of the typical political map: Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi (where she held a town hall-style event televised by CNN). She made two trips to both Iowa and New Hampshire, and none to South Carolina.

Texto completo: The federal government has an oversight problem. This is likely not a news flash to most people, as tales of corruption and scandal seem to be a dime a dozen nowadays.

But the recent revelation that the Drug Enforcement Administration was collecting bulk data about Americans' purchases of money-counting machines, done in secret and without the consent of the courts, is a stark reminder that the lack of oversight is a persistent and serious problem.

Operated from 2008 to 2013, right in the thick of the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program that was later exposed by Edward Snowden, the DEA's program was issuing blanket administrative subpoenas to learn who was buying money counters, according to a report by The New York Times.

Money counters are used to process large quantities of cash, something not too many private citizens have a need for. Black market entrepreneurs like drug dealers, however, often make use of such devices. So the DEA's interest in who buys a money counter is somewhat understandable.

But there was no particular focus or case associated with the agency's collection of these transactions, just an unrestrained desire to achieve justice by any means necessary.

The DEA was fully aware of the illicit nature of the program. An inspector general's report found that the agency would often pursue cases against certain individuals without disclosing what evidence had put that person in its sights. Officials had explicit instructions to exclude information related to the money-counter database.

In what may be an early candidate for the biggest understatement of 2019, the inspector general concluded that the DEA had failed to conduct a comprehensive legal analysis of this program, and characterized it as legally questionable at best.

This is a remarkably generous assessment of what is almost unquestionably an illegal surveillance program operated by a federal agency. There is likely no telling how many innocent people were caught up in the dragnet.

So what will happen to the people who orchestrated this program and have caused the DEA significant, even if temporary, embarrassment?

In all likelihood, the answer is nothing. With the program six years in the rearview mirror, it is hard to imagine that there is much interest in prosecuting faceless bureaucrats.

But Congress should be motivated to take more care, concern and control over a federal apparatus that often believes it can operate freely and without accountability. Congressional representatives have an obligation to protect their constituents from illegal intrusions by law enforcement and government officials.

There is little solace in uncovering a rampant surveillance program six years after the fact. Representatives who take action against such abuse? Now that's something most people might feel pretty good about.

This year's Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado Boulder, which begins Tuesday, features a full day of events on Saturday and the first animated film for the Ebert Interruptus selection.
This year the conference also will start on a Tuesday and run through Saturday to be more accessible, according to Erin Rain, marketing and media relations manager for the conference. It's the first time in many years the conference has used this schedule.
"We're hoping more people can join us for some great events on the weekend," Rain said.
Rain said the best way to look through events is by using the conference's mobile app, as there are nearly 200 events and 100 speakers this year.
Keynote speakers for the conference include Australian designer Leyla Acaroglu, Ms. Foundation for Women CEO and President Teresa Younger, CEO of Scout.ai Berit Anderson, soccer champion Hope Solo and "The Simpsons" writer and producer Mike Reiss.
When asked about some of Solo's controversies involving alleged domestic violence, Rain said the program committee chose to invite her because of her work fighting for equal pay and diversity in sports.
The committee adheres to CU Boulder's free expression policy, which says that campus groups can invite anyone to speak.
"Solo has previously visited the CU Boulder campus as a classroom guest speaker addressing equal pay in sport and the role of athletes in sport governance," Rain said.
The Ebert Interruptus series, a conference tradition and four-part event that shows a film and analyzes it in stop-start fashion, features "WALL-E" this year. It's the first animated movie to be shown as part of the event, Rain said.
Josh Larsen, a film critic and author, will host the series. He said in a news release that "WALL-E" "places great importance on aesthetic elements such as production design, editing, music, character design, and more. These are exactly the sort of details we dig into throughout Interruptus — in addition to considering things like theme and story — so I'm confident WALL-E will stand up to the scrutiny, while also being a ton of fun to watch with a crowd."
In addition to a number of events addressing politics and current issues, Rain said there is a group of high-profile journalists this year, including Miriam Jordan of The New York Times, Ana Cabrera of CNN and Michael Gerson of the Washington Post.
Yale University astrophysicist Priya Natarajan will also be giving a plenary address called "Mapping the Heavens and Unraveling the Dark Side of the Universe." Natarajan's theory on black holes, developed two decades ago, was recently proven correct.
The city is also sponsoring free HOP bus services for everyone during the conference to encourage multimodal travel during the events, which attract more than 70,000 people to Boulder, according to a news release from the city.
The HOP, which normally costs $3, runs between Boulder Junction, the Twenty Ninth Street Mall, CU Boulder and the downtown area. Free parking is available on the second floor of the Macy's parking garage at the Twenty Ninth Street Mall.

Texto completo: It was a paroxysm that inscribed new chapters in the annals of genocide and turned a spotlight on the failure of international peacekeepers to come anywhere close to living up to their name.
Twenty-five years ago, on April 7, 1994, the dominant Hutus of Rwanda turned with well-planned violence on the Tutsi minority whom they held to be traitors. One hundred days later, when the killing finally stopped, the death toll stood at as many as one million, mostly Tutsis but also including some moderate Hutus who had opposed the bloodletting.
The scale of the fatalities was shocking, but more was to come as the torrent of killings washed into the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, igniting years of strife in Africa's Great Lakes region. And, along this bloodstained way, sexual violence became woven into the horrors of war. Women suffered untold rapes and gang rapes, accelerating the spread of AIDS. The offspring of these assaults were stigmatized as "children of the killers."
In the same year in which Nelson Mandela was installed as South Africa's first black president -- the very emblem of a continent's hope and triumph over adversity -- Africa was also in the public eye for cataclysmic anarchy and violence.
But Africa had no monopoly on blame.
The United States, scarred by the killing and humiliation of its soldiers in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu a few months earlier, had no appetite to intervene. President Bill Clinton, who was in office as the killings unfolded half a world away, said years later during a visit to Rwanda, "I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it."
France, a significant player in French-speaking Africa, has long faced charges that it supported the Hutu leadership before and even during the massacres. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has called French soldiers "actors" in the genocide -- a charge denied by the former French prime minister, Édouard Balladur, as "a self-interested lie." But on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron of France ordered a two-year government study of France's role in the Rwandan genocide.
The United Nations, which had a modest force of some 2,500 troops in Rwanda in the days leading up to the killings, was accused of refusing permission for its local commander, the Canadian Maj. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, to raid a Hutu arms cache that had been set aside for use in the atrocities. At the time, Kofi Annan, who later became the secretary general of the United Nations, was in charge of peacekeeping operations. Years later he said of the killing, "All of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to prevent it."
History suggests, however, that Rwanda's lessons were an insufficient deterrent. Just a year after the Rwandan genocide, events far away in Europe -- in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica -- offered another alarming example of the toxic combination of genocidal urges and United Nations caution: 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered despite the presence of Dutch peacekeepers.
And, for its part, an African panel found many culprits for Rwanda's agony, from the Roman Catholic Church to Belgium, a former colonial power.
The ostensible trigger for the genocide came on April 6, 1994, when an airplane carrying the country's Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana, and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi was shot down as it approached Kigali, Rwanda's capital. It has never been clearly established who brought the plane down or whether the genocide had been planned well in advance and needed only a spark to ignite its lethal tinder.
But within hours, the killing had started. Elite government forces, supported by a dreaded Hutu militia, the Interahamwe, which translates roughly as "those who work together," rounded up and executed Tutsi military and political leaders. Roadblocks were thrown up to filter out Rwandans whose official ID tagged them as Tutsis -- a distinction introduced in the 1930s by the Belgian colonial authorities. Like their imperial German predecessors, Belgian officials had favored a Tutsi elite until the Hutu majority rose up in 1959.
In rural areas, where Hutus and Tutsis had intermingled and sometimes intermarried, pervasive government propaganda in radio broadcasts and newspaper articles urged Hutus to take any weapon they could find -- machetes, clubs -- to kill or maim their neighbors. Foreigners working in the country were evacuated, but not their Rwandan staff. People were massacred in churches and homes, fields and roadside ditches, stadiums and checkpoints.
As in Cambodia after the atrocities by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, future generations inherited a national nightmare, memorialized in the exhibited skulls of victims stacked in rows.
In 1994, the genocide also ruptured a cease-fire in a civil war that had been raging since 1990 between government forces and insurgents from the Rwanda Patriotic Front, led by the Tutsi Mr. Kagame (who was to become Rwanda's president).
The Patriotic Front launched a broad attack to take the capital, Kigali, in early July. The killing in Rwanda itself came to a halt, but not the ethnic recriminations. With the land ruined, crops untended and the population diminished by the killing of Tutsis and the subsequent flight of Hutu refugees into Congo, Rwanda entered a new, gradually prospering but ambiguous era. The following years raised questions about post-genocide justice and the price Rwandans paid for well-being and stability under Mr. Kagame.
Internationally, the Rwandan leader, who took over the presidency in 2000, became a darling of Western leaders and donors, including Mr. Clinton and Bill Gates. His cities boasted clean streets and low crime. His economy grew rapidly. Admirers compared him to Lee Kuan Yew, the Singaporean leader who fused authoritarian rule with prosperity.
And, as Mr. Kagame's regime grew ever more entrenched and ever more intolerant of dissent, he often got a pass. "Western states that did nothing to prevent the massacres have treated Rwanda with kid gloves ever since, in part out of a frequently acknowledged sense of guilt," the author and journalist Michela Wrong wrote in The Guardian.
Mr. Kagame was limited to two terms in office, but like his regional peers in Uganda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- and rulers much farther afield -- he chafed at the restriction. A referendum in 2015 changed the Constitution, enabling him to remain in office until 2034. In elections in 2017 he won with a staggering 98.8 percent of the vote. (Of his two major opponents, Diane Rwigara was disqualified, later to be jailed, and Victoire Ingabire was already in prison.)
Rights groups have chronicled abuses inside Rwanda and have accused the authorities of hunting down adversaries and critics in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa and Europe. In 2014, Patrick Karegeya, Mr. Kagame's former chief of external intelligence and a known dissident, was found murdered in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg, although the government in Kigali has denied suggestions that it was behind the killing.
In 2014, as Rwanda marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide, an editorial in The New York Times hailed the country as "an island of order and relative prosperity in a poor and politically volatile region."
But, listing a tally of restrictions on civil and political rights, including detentions and torture, disappearances and killings, the article concluded: "Addressing the poisonous legacies of Rwanda's genocide is the only way to avert future tragedy, and it is the best way to honor Rwanda's dead."

The Kardashians won't bend the knee to your outrage

Texto completo: "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" debuted more than a decade ago as a reality sitcom featuring lighthearted shenanigans, not tonally far-off from a number of other family-oriented shows on celebrity suburbanites. Today, both the show and the clan have metastasized into a lightning rod, a cultural Rorschach test aggressively challenging our opinions on fame, family, aesthetics, and merit.

In 2007, "Kim Kardashian, Superstar" was nothing but a leaked sex tape featuring Paris Hilton's stylist and her B-list rapper boyfriend. Today, she's a superstar in earnest, the pioneer of social media-fueled fashion, and married to one of our generation's most influential rappers and producers. Half-sister Kendall Jenner became the highest-paid supermodel in the world, and Forbes just deemed Kylie Jenner the youngest self-made billionaire in human history.

Twelve years ago, the commentariat mocked them as gauche, nouveau riche, and slightly too curvy in a culture that celebrated wafer-thin, perennially childless actresses. Today they loathe them.

While Kardashian haters come a dime a dozen, none is more hysterical than Jameela Jamil, an actress who fancies herself an activist. She has lambasted the family as "double agents for the patriarchy" and a "terrible and toxic influence on young girls." Jamil is particularly obsessed that they built their brand on selling not just scientifically dubious products that promote beauty and weight loss but also their image as a whole.

But the Kardashians refuse to bend the knee to the outrage overlords. In a New York Times profile preceding the 16th season premiere, matriarch Kris Jenner addressed detractors.

"I don’t live in that negative energy space," Jenner told the Times. "Ninety percent of people will be really excited about the family and the journey and who we are."

Predictably, Jamil melted down online, claiming the family's "pockets are lined with the blood and diarrhea of teenage girls."

The one-way feud presents an amusing microcosm of how morality is enforced today: A rogue entity upends standards in a way that first attracts jeers, brewing contempt, and then outright ire, until the mob intervenes to demand fealty to the norms. Like them or hate them, the Kardashians revolutionized not just Hollywood's beauty standards but the business model as a whole, vertically integrating fashion from the factory to Instagram sales.

The Kardashians are happy warriors, as keen to double down in the face of the haters as President Trump or New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Honestly, that's the heroism Hollywood needs, even if it doesn't deserve it, to counterbalance the self-loathing spoilsports.

Some on Russia investigation frustrated by Barr's summary

Texto completo: Members of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team have told associates they are frustrated with the limited information Atty. Gen. William Barr has provided about their nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump sought to obstruct justice, according to people familiar with the matter.
The displeasure among some who worked on the inquiry has quietly begun to surface in the days since Barr released a four-page letter to Congress on March 24 describing what he said were the principal conclusions of Mueller's still-confidential, 400-page report.
In his letter, Barr said the special counsel did not establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. And he said Mueller did not reach a conclusion as to whether Trump's conduct in office constituted obstruction of justice.

Barr told lawmakers that he concluded the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the president obstructed justice.
But members of Mueller's team have complained to close associates that the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant.
"It was much more acute than Barr suggested," said one person, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity.
The New York Times first reported that some special counsel investigators feel that Barr did not adequately portray their findings.
Some members of the office were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared, according to two people familiar with their reactions.
"There was immediate displeasure from the team when they saw how the attorney general had characterized their work instead," according one U.S. official briefed on the matter.
Summaries were prepared for different sections of the report, with a view that they could made public, the official said.
The report was prepared "so that the front matter from each section could have been released immediately -- or very quickly," the official said. "It was done in a way that minimum redactions, if any, would have been necessary, and the work would have spoken for itself."
Mueller's team assumed the information was going to be made available to the public, the official said, "and so they prepared their summaries to be shared in their own words -- and not in the attorney general's summary of their work, as turned out to be the case."
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel and attorneys for the president did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
After Barr's release of limited information, Trump claimed the Mueller report provided him with "complete and total exoneration."
During nearly two years of work, Mueller's team -- 19 lawyers and roughly 40 FBI agents, analysts and other professional staff -- worked in near silence, speaking only rarely through court filings. That some are now confiding to associates signals the level of their distress.
Some members of the team appear caught off guard by how Trump has used Barr's letter to claim total victory, as the limited information about their work has been weaponized in the country's highly polarized political environment, according to people familiar with their responses.
Their frustrations come as polls show many Americans have already drawn conclusions about the special counsel findings even though only a handful of words from the report have been released.
On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) questioned on MSNBC why Barr did not release Mueller's summary material "instead of trying to shape it through his own words."
It is not clear whether Mueller's full investigative findings will be released publicly.
Barr told Congress in a letter last week that the principal conclusions he described were not meant to be a summary of Mueller's investigation. He said he is aiming to submit a redacted version of the report to Congress by mid-April.
"Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own," Barr wrote.
The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for the entire report, as well as investigative materials, though Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said he would wait to see what Barr makes public.

Texto completo: OAKLAND >> Anti-Semitic comments, the phrase "death trap" and a possible jury field trip all came up Wednesday during the second day of a trial against two men blamed for the deaths of 36 people killed in the Ghost Ship warehouse fire.
Defendants Derick Almena and Max Harris are each being tried on 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter involving the deadly East Oakland fire on Dec. 2, 2016. About 30 motions were made as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued over what should or shouldn't be presented as evidence when a jury finally begins hearing testimony, possibly next month.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Trina Thompson, who is presiding over the trial, is expected to rule on two motions filed by the defense within the next week. One concerns a potential visit by the jury to what remains of the burned warehouse on 31st Avenue and the other involves a joke Almena allegedly made about himself being Adolf Hitler and Harris "his Jewish slave."
In an interview with the New York Times Magazine published in December, Harris told the reporter that "Almena spoke to Harris in a sharp German accent, pretending that Harris, whose mother was Jewish, was his Jew, his slave."
"For the record, my client is not anti-Semitic," Tony Serra, Almena's attorney, said in requesting that the reference be omitted from the trial.
But prosecutor Casey Bates argued the remark showed the power dynamic between the two men and how Almena had dominance over Harris.
Judge Thompson said she would take some time to reflect on the issue, given that this information was already out there.
The judge also will decide within the next week whether the 12-person jury and up to six alternates should be allowed to visit the warehouse during the defense's presentation of evidence. Such a field trip could take weeks to plan, given safety concerns about the state of the building itself and transportation of the jury, she said.
She noted the jurors would not be allowed to talk during the visit, nor would attorneys or anyone else be allowed to point things out once inside, such as the front staircase, or the origin of the fire.
Curtis Briggs, one of the attorneys for Harris, said such a visit to the warehouse in February helped him see for himself such critical objects as staircases and doors on the second floor.
"It only makes sense in the context of being there," he said.
Harris' attorneys also asked that references to the Ghost Ship as a "death trap," "fire trap" or maze be excluded from the trial. But Bates objected, saying such language used by witnesses in the preliminary hearing showed the degree of Almena and Harris' criminal negligence.
Briggs argued that the language was unfair to use and no expert witness labeled the warehouse a death trap. Serra added that such metaphors are "highly prejudicial" and irrelevant.
Thompson ruled that the words would not be appropriate for opening statements, unless quoting a witness' own language. She said it was "fair game" if witnesses already used such language in the preliminary hearing.
Other motions on Wednesday included one by Almena's attorneys asking that spectators be restricted from wearing buttons signs or T-shirts with photos of victims' faces that may distract or influence the jury. Brian Getz, an attorney for Almena, referred to the two-day sentencing hearing when family members of the 36 victims brought posters, photos and other items to court with them.
Briggs however, disagreed with the motion and stated Harris has felt strongly about the victims' families.
"It would be a further victimization," Briggs said.
Thompson ruled in Almena's favor, stating that the court did not want to impact jurors inappropriately. She pointed out that both defendants' family and friends and victims' family will have to adhere to the rules.
The case continues Thursday with more motions.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump last week insisted that Republicans would move this year to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. Or possibly not. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear the GOP Senate did not plan to spend time on the effort as long as the House is controlled by Democrats. So, the president changed his tune. At least for the moment.
Meanwhile, states with legislatures and governors that oppose abortion are racing to pass abortion bans and get them to the Supreme Court, where, they hope, the new majority there will overturn or scale back the current right to abortion.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, Rebecca Adams of CQ Roll Call, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News and Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico.
Also, Rovner interviews KHN’s Paula Andalo, who wrote the latest “ Bill of the Month ” feature about a very expensive knee brace.
If you have an exorbitant or inexplicable medical bill you’d like to submit for our series, you can do that here.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
Although Trump’s political base may support his actions to undermine the entire federal health law, Republican lawmakers are flummoxed. They are hesitant to take up the cause because Democrats used the issue so effectively against Republicans in last fall’s election. They also know that many Republicans like key provisions of the health law, such as its closing of the doughnut hole in the Medicare drug benefit, letting adult children stay on parents’ plans up to the age of 26 and protecting people with preexisting conditions. The unveiling this week of a new Democratic health initiative — Medicare X — signals an increasing push by party moderates to move away from progressives’ call to dramatically reshape American health care with a “Medicare-for-all” system. Medicare X is a much smaller initiative that would allow some people to buy in to the Medicare system, but it would be rolled out gradually over a number of years. In other ACA news, a federal judge struck down the administration’s regulations allowing small businesses to join association health plans, saying it was an end run to avoid the health law. Thousands of people could be affected by the decision, and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta said he will decide by the end of the May whether to appeal. Anti-abortion activists in many states are pushing new laws to test whether the retirement last summer of Justice Anthony Kennedy has left the Supreme Court more willing to turn back the Roe v. Wade decision. Among the types of cases going forward are state laws that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat could be determined, which often happens about six weeks into a pregnancy or before many women even know they are pregnant. Despite a stiff rejection last week by a federal judge who overturned the Trump administration’s permission for work requirements in the Medicaid expansion approved in Arkansas and Kentucky, federal officials said that Utah could go forward with a plan to start work requirements as part of a partial expansion. Supporters of the ACA insist that expansion should be for anyone earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. But the issue is tough for Democrats, some of whom say a partial expansion is better than none.

Dentist charged in college admissions scandal lost book deals because of case, lawyers say

Texto completo: A prominent California dentist charged in connection with the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal has lost three book deals because of the onslaught of publicity surrounding the case, legal filings show.
But on Wednesday the defendant, Dr. Homayoun Zadeh, 57, heard some good news when a federal judge in Boston granted his request to travel abroad for speaking engagements while his case is pending.
Zadeh's charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly conspiring to pay a $100,000 bribe in several installments in exchange for having his daughter certified as a lacrosse recruit at USC, even though she didn't play the sport competitively, records show.
Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley on Wednesday approved Zadeh's motion for permission to travel to upcoming conferences in foreign locales.
The motion, filed March 21, laid out the professional challenges faced by Zadeh since his arrest.
“As a result of his highly publicized arrest, Dr. Zadeh has been placed on administrative leave from his position as the director of the Laboratory for Immunoregulation and Tissue Engineering at the University of Southern California, and has lost 3 book contracts," the motion said. “Dr. Zadeh makes this motion to avoid canceling upcoming speaking events so that he may continue to earn a living and pay his legal fees to defend against the charges in this case."
According to court records, Zadeh is slated to give talks on April 19 in Malaysia, April 21 in Taiwan, May 3 in Canada, and May 31 in France.
“Dr. Zadeh is an internationally respected periodontist, and is not a flight risk," the motion said. “He has strong ties to southern California, where he lives, works, and was arrested. He has been a professor at the University of Southern California for 26 years, where he also received his D.D.S. in 1987."
The filing noted that Zadeh has paid a “substantial bond of $100,000 to guarantee his presence. As the Court is aware, the matter has already been the subject of intense scrutiny and Dr. Zadeh has already garnered significant media interest. It is highly unlikely that a defendant in this matter could successfully flee, and any attempt to flee would result in national and even international headlines."
Zadeh is one of 50 people charged in the breathtaking scheme that has also ensnared coaches, Hollywood stars, and captains of industry.

Biden says he'll change behavior

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a two-minute video released Wednesday, defended past behavior of close contact with women that has come under recent scrutiny, but also said he's able to change.
The response from Biden, who is laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run, came a day after two more women shared stories of encounters with him that they alleged were inappropriate. Their comments followed similar complaints from two other women.
"I want to talk about gestures of support that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable," Biden said, seated on a couch and speaking directly to the camera. "I've always tried to make a human connection that's my responsibility, I think ... it's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and listening."
Biden continued, saying he is going to be "mindful" of people's boundaries going forward.
"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I get it, I get it, I hear what they're saying and I understand it," he said. "I'll be much more mindful, that's my responsibility, and I'll meet it."
Biden stopped short of apologizing for his past behavior, instead circling back to his previous defense that politics is about human connection.
Questions about Biden's behavior with women have flared since last Friday when Lucy Flores, a politician in Nevada, shared her first-person account of an alleged incident with Biden at a campaign event when she claims he kissed the back of her head.
Since then, Amy Lappos alleged Biden rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser, and on Tuesday The New York Times published stories of two more women who allege Biden touched them in ways that they say were not appropriate.
Biden's propensity for being affectionate, once brushed off as "Biden being Biden" is now being viewed through a #MeToo lens, and it could prove problematic for his expected presidential run, especially since some women have not forgiven him for his handling of Anita Hill's testimony in 1991 at the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, which he oversaw.
But Biden's defenders point to his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act and combating sexual assault on campus as examples of how he's led on these issues throughout his career.
In the video, Biden also defends his record.
"I worked my whole life to empower women, to prevent abuse, so the idea that I can't adjust to the fact that personal space is important, more important than it's ever been, is just not thinkable," he said. "I will. I will."

Hillary Clinton turned down meeting Rupert Murdoch during 2016 campaign

Texto completo: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch once considered endorsing former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for president.

Murdoch’s daughter-in-law, Kathryn, attempted to set up a meeting between her father-in-law and Clinton, who she knew from her work with the Clinton Climate Initiative, but Clinton turned down the meeting.

Murdoch called Clinton’s 2016 campaign headquarters personally and left a message, which Clinton returned almost immediately to decline his invitation for a meeting, the New York Times reports.

The effort was unprecedented for Murdoch, who once hosted a Senate fundraiser for Clinton.

Clinton's refusal came as Fox News helped boost the profile of then-candidate Donald Trump as he rose to prominence. Fox News is a subsidiary of Murdoch’s media empire.

Murdoch was initially opposed to the idea of a Trump presidency, and three sources told the Times that in the past he has said, “He’s a [expletive] idiot,” when referring to the president.

By March 2016, when Trump became the Republican Party’s clear front-runner, Murdoch started to come around to the idea of Trump in the White House.

“If he becomes inevitable, party would be mad not to unify,” Murdoch tweeted.

Texto completo: Kristen Brogdon will be Northrop’s new director of programming, Northrop announced late last week. Brogdon will succeed Christine Tschida, who joined Northrop as director in August 2012.
Brogdon’s experience includes nearly four years at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, where she directed the Office of the Arts and served as UNCW’s interim associate vice chancellor for community engagement. Prior to that, she spent almost eight years at Hubbard Street Dance Chicago as artistic administrator and general manager, and nine years at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., where she programmed the ballet and contemporary dance season. She was also the general manager of the Suzanne Farrell Ballet.
At Northrop, Brogdon will be responsible for conceiving, curating, developing and implementing the artistic vision of Northrop’s performing arts and related education programs. We won’t see her dance programming chops until the 2020-21 season. The 2019-20 season, due to be announced soon, was programmed by Tschida.
Brogdon will start her new job on June 24. She will report to Kari Schloner, who became Northrop’s new director last June.
Leadership change at Minnesota Bach Ensemble
Co-founder of the Minnesota Bach Ensemble, Andrew Altenbach has served as its artistic director and conductor since 2013. MBE recently announced that Altenbach will step down at the end of this season and Mischa Santora will succeed him. Altenbach will have led MBE through seven seasons of thoughtfully curated concerts performed by Bach-heads including current and former Minnesota Orchestra musicians. He’ll conduct his second-to-last concerts this weekend (see the picks). His final concert with MBE will be Monday, May 13.
Altenbach lives in Massachusetts and has been commuting to Minnesota. Santora lives in Minnesota and has been commuting to Massachusetts as the music director of Boston Ballet. Santora also serves as music director of MacPhail’s Spotlight Series and has often conducted the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, most recently in March. He was associate conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra from 2003–2009.
Two Met Opera audition winners have Twin Cities ties
If you’re a would-be opera singer, winning the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions can launch your career. Just ask Renée Fleming, Susan Graham, Frederica von Stade, Deborah Voigt, Thomas Hampson and Eric Owens, to name a few.
So when we saw the list of this year’s winners – the Final Five, who rose to the top after months of local and regional auditions – we were thrilled to find two names we know: Thomas Glass and Miles Mykkanen.
Glass, a baritone, hails from Edina. He was a Minnesota Opera resident artist in 2016-17. He sang Capulet in the company’s production of “Romeo & Juliet,” Gustave in “Dinner at Eight” and Schaunard in “La Boheme.” He’s currently a second-year studio artist at Houston Grand Opera.
Mykkanen, a tenor, is from Bessemer, Michigan, so we can’t claim him as our own. But we’ll never forget his Minnesota Opera debut as Lt. Sprink in last November’s return of “Silent Night,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning opera born here in 2011.
The 65th year of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions drew more than 1,000 singers to district-level and regional auditions held across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. On Sunday, nine finalists performed on the Met stage for a panel of judges. Each of the five winners received a cash prize of $15,000.
The other three winners were bass William Guanbo Su from Beijing, China; soprano Elena Villalón from Austin, Texas; and mezzo-soprano Michaela Wolz from Eureka, Missouri.
The picks
Note: If you were planning to see poet Jorie Graham at Coffman Union on Thursday, April 4, that event has been canceled.
Tonight (Wednesday, April 3) in the Walker Cinema: Rukmini Callimachi: “ISIS, Journalism, and the Internet.” New York Times foreign correspondent Callimachi has covered ISIS since 2014. A three-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, she started covering terrorism when locals in Timbuktu, Mali, led her to the HQ of al-Qaeda’s North African branch – and nearly 15,000 pages of internal al-Qaeda documents. Her podcast, “Caliphate,” has over 25 million downloads. At the Walker, she’ll draw on her knowledge of the militant group to examine the effects of the internet as a journalistic tool and a political weapon. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/20/12). This is part of the Walker’s Mack Lecture series, which looks amazing this year; Claudia Rankine speaks next Wednesday.
Friday through Sunday at the St. Paul RiverCentre: 2019 American Craft Show. This premiere show and sale of American craft – jewelry, clothing, furniture and home décor – takes place in just four U.S. cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, San Francisco and St. Paul. We’d like to think that our show gets some special attention from the parent organization, the American Craft Council, because ACC is based in Minneapolis. Held indoors, out of our changeable weather, this year’s show features 230 artists from across the country. You’ll want to take your time going through it, looking at beautiful things and talking with the artists. Much of it is higher-end, but there are affordables to be found. And an emerging artists program, so be sure to look for the Hip Pop booths and check them out, too. 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($11 advance through Thursday, $13 on-site; $5 after 5 p.m. Friday only). Here’s the list of this year’s artists.
Opens Friday at Strike Theater: Four Humors presents “The Last Days of Commodus.” The troupe that brought us the smash hit “Lolita” – based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, “as told by three idiots” – returns with the tale of Commodus, set in the Roman Empire in 193 AD. Commodus is “a vain, power-hungry madman sowing chaos to further his own interests while sinking ever deeper into delusion and paranoia as those who seek to end his corrupt reign grow ever closer.” Matt Spring wrote it and Jason Ballweber directs a cast of five. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20/15/10 advance, pay-what-you-can at the door). Ends April 20.
Saturday and Monday at MacPhail’s Antonello Hall: Minnesota Bach Ensemble: Brilliant Vivaldi and Bach. Superstar American mezzo-soprano Meg Bragle will sing J.S. Bach’s “Laudamus te” from the B-minor Mass, his “Ich habe genug” (“I am content”) cantata, and Vivaldi’s virtuosic, acrobatic “Vos invito” motet. (Here she is singing the “Agnus Dei” from the mass, if you want to hear her lovely voice.) The program also includes CPE Bach’s Oboe Concerto in B-flat and Handel’s Concerto Grosso op. 6 no. 3, featuring oboist Basil Reeve and violinist Jonathan Magness. 3 p.m. Saturday, 7 p.m. Monday. FMI and tickets ($30/10 students).

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: TORONTO – Brie Larson may have decked her directorial debut, "Unicorn Store," in rainbows, glitter and tulle, but there are serious issues afoot in her tale of a directionally paralyzed twentysomething.
The film, which debuts on Netflix Friday, follows Kit (played by Larson), an artist whose fanciful, sparkly paintings earn her derision at an art school that promptly kicks her out. Directionless and moored to her parents’ couch, Kit decides to grab life by her mother's borrowed skirt suit and try out a temp job at a PR firm.
Newly resigned to a mundane maze of cubicles and copy machines, Kit begins receiving mysterious invitations to "the store," which, manned by an eccentric shopkeeper (Samuel L. Jackson), turns out to sell the one thing her childlike heart has always desired most: real unicorns.

"Unicorn Store" debuted at Toronto International Film Festival in September 2017, almost a full month before The New York Times and The New Yorker published sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, which would go on to trigger a nationwide Me Too movement. But "Unicorn Store" threads its fanciful tale with colder realities of traps that often target young women at work, including scenes in which the company's vice president steps in too close, sniffs Kit's hair and corners her for a private lunch.
At a Q&A for the film at the festival, an audience member asked Larson about those microaggressions, questioning her decision to “underplay what could be viewed as sexual harassment in the workplace. ”
Larson, who would go on to star in the blockbuster Captain Marvel a year and a half later, politely disagreed, citing her own experience in Hollywood.
“Personally, I don’t feel like the sexual harassment stuff is lightly played," said Larson. "I think it’s pretty strongly there. But I do think that Kit’s unawareness of it at times or confusion with it is because I truly have experienced that on a lot of sets. Where you’re like, 'Am I supposed to take this as a compliment? Is this how I’m supposed to be talked to?' As a woman, I’ve always had this question of, this feeling like, 'Well, I’m not pretty enough for them to do that to me. ' "
'I'm crying a lot today': Brie Larson gets emotional at 'Captain Marvel' premiere
The actress, a longtime activist for sexual assault survivors, drove home how murky the waters in the workplace can be.
"It’s so confusing. Because in reality, say (Kit) went to HR, and was like, ‘He’s giving me a problem. ’ What would she say? He smelled my hair? There’s nothing that she can say that (proves) he actually crossed a line.
"But we all watch it and we go, ‘Whoa, he’s crossing a line. ’ And I felt like that was an important thing to put in a film. That it doesn’t have to be so forceful. Sexual harassment is way subtler and weirder and it’s a bigger gray area. ”
The sweet and slightly twee Unicorn Store successfully shows a strong comedic side of Larson, who told USA TODAY in March that training for Captain Marvel has given her newfound confidence.
“It's a combination of what martial arts has done for my brain and what learning how to own my body in this new way has done for me,” Larson said. “Your brain starts to explore new ways of being. Then, when the movie was over, I was like, this new baseline feels better for me. "

Texto completo: Donald Trump won the 2016 election last weekend — again.
The professional Trump Haters in Washington, Manhattan and Hollywood are still in full denial mode, though, and they're refusing to accept Special Counsel Robert Mueller's determination that the president and his campaign did not collude with the Russians.
It's sad.
The anti-Trump zealots in the Democrat Party and liberal media have been deluding themselves for two years that Mueller and his lawyers were going to nail Trump on collusion, obstruction or any number of impeachable crimes.
Journalists at the New York Times and the Washington Post swallowed every crazy story the Democrats spun about Trump — and then blared them as fact on their front pages with little or no skepticism.
Meanwhile, MSNBC/CNN's troika of Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and Don Lemon piled on nightly.
In addition to their own left-liberal rants, they paraded out every Trump enemy or ex-Obama team member they could find to call the president a liar, a crook, a tax cheat, a dictator, a traitor, a puppet of Putin...
But the Trump Haters' bubble broke with a huge pop recently when Attorney General William Barr reported that Mueller's investigation had found that the president was telling the truth.
"No collusion on Russia" was crushing news for the lefties and fake journalists on MSNBC and CNN, the co-flagships of the Fake News fleet.
Maddow and Lemon almost cried on camera, and Matthews was so speechless he couldn't interrupt anyone.
I'd cry too if I were one of those guys.
After two years of being wrong, wrong, wrong about Trump and the Russians, their credentials as pundits or commentators are shot — and apparently even many of their loyal viewers know it.
The large audience of liberals Maddow had built up with her tedious nightly "seminars" about Trump's alleged treason dropped by about 20 percent this week — probably because so many distraught viewers are visiting grief counselors.
Maddow and her equally deranged MSNBC colleague "Morning Joe" Scarborough are in complete denial. They are not apologizing for how they and the biased journalists in their political camp got it so wrong about Russian collusion.
Maddow and Scarborough are imitating my own embarrassing Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who claims to know stuff about Trump that Mueller's army of lawyers and investigators could not dig up.
They are now nitpicking Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of the Mueller report and hinting of an even bigger conspiracy.
Meanwhile, President Trump has the last laugh — a big one — and he now has the high political ground. He's already embarked on a "No Collusion" victory tour in the Midwest and his chances are looking better than ever for reelection in 2020.
Without collusion and obstruction, the Democrats have no major issues left to attack President Trump. The economy is still doing great. Unemployment among blacks, Latinos and women is at all-time lows. Incomes and wages are going up.
So all they really have is collusion, obstruction and impeachment, which is why we'll be seeing Mueller and Barr dragged into the House of Representatives to be interrogated by Schiff and his fellow desperate Democrats.
Michael Reagan is the son of President Ronald Reagan, a political consultant, and the author of "Lessons My Father Taught Me: The Strength, Integrity, and Faith of Ronald Reagan." He is the founder of the email service reagan.com and president of The Reagan Legacy Foundation.

Texto completo: Two more women came forward to accuse former Vice President Joe Biden of awkward and unwarranted physical contact with the former vice president.

Caitlyn Caruso, 22, and D. J. Hill, 59, both told the New York Times about physical interactions they had with Biden that made them uncomfortable.

Caruso, a sexual assault survivor, said that during an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas when she was 19, Biden rested his hand on her thigh and persisted as she showed discomfort. She also said he hugged her “just a little bit too long."

Hill said that Biden put his hand on her shoulder and dropped it down her back too far when she was taking a photograph with him at a fundraising event in Minneapolis in 2012. She said the interaction made her “very uncomfortable.”

“Only he knows his intent,” Hill said, and “if something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it.”

This makes four women who have brought up questions over Biden’s touchy habits, including Lucy Flores, who alleged Biden inappropriately came up behind her at a campaign event in 2004, rested his hands on her shoulders, and kissed the top of her head. Amy Lappos, 43, said Biden touched her inappropriately at a political fundraiser in 2009 when she was a congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.

Images of Biden’s close interaction with women have been widely shared before, but have been reupped since Flores came forward with an account of the incident in a piece published Friday.

Some who have been featured in questionable photographs with Biden say that the pictured interactions have been misrepresented and misinterpreted as inappropriate.

As Biden weighs a presidential run, some have expressed concern that this could harm his chances should he choose to compete for the Democratic nomination.

Others, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, feel that the allegations should not force Biden to not run.

“I don’t think it’s disqualifying,” Pelosi told Politico, adding that Biden should be less handsy and “join the straight arm club.”

Don't change money goals for spring break

Texto completo: Driving is pretty much always the cheapest way to travel, so check out a destination within five or six hours of where you live. If you have to fly, you'll save money if you stay within the United States versus going to an overseas destination.
We've all been waiting for a break from this cold, dreary winter. Well, for students – and their families – across the country, it's finally here: spring break! But as much as you've been pining for sunshine and a beach, spring break isn't an excuse to bust the budget or, worse, go into debt.
Your money goals shouldn't change based on the time of year. So, to help you save money, here's my list of best and worst things to do for spring break.
Best things to do for spring break Stay stateside. Driving is pretty much always the cheapest way to travel, so check out a destination within five or six hours of where you live. If you have to fly, you'll save money if you stay within the United States versus going to an overseas destination.
Visit southern beaches. I'm not just saying this because I'm from the South! Destinations like Daytona, Florida, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, are absolutely gorgeous. You can find hotel deals in both cities for around $75 per night.
Stay with friends. When I look back on my spring breaks, it's not the places I remember as much as the people I was with. Do you have a friend you haven't seen in a while who lives in a cool city that would be fun to visit? You'll both save money and make the most of your time off by staying at the each other's places for spring break.
Worst things to do for spring break Get a timeshare. Timeshares are one of the top sellers in the travel industry, but they're also one of the biggest scams on the market today. Think about it. Why spend thousands of dollars on a place you might get to enjoy one week a year? Oh, and you never have any equity in the place. If you're already stuck with one, it is possible to get out from under it. Timeshare Exit Team is dedicated to helping timeshare owners dissolve their unwanted timeshare contracts, legally and forever.
Go to Disney World. Listen, I love me some Disney. I am totally convinced it's the happiest place on earth – except during spring break. Why spend all that money to go during the time of year when everyone else has the exact same idea? If you go just before or after spring break, you'll find shorter lines, happier kids and possibly a better deal.
Use a credit card. Seventy-four percent of Americans have gone into debt for a vacation, so when the Fourth of July rolls around, they're probably still paying off spring break. Like my dad, Dave Ramsey, always says, "The best vacations are the ones that don't follow you home." Putting a vacation on a credit card isn't a good option. Don't let our culture tell you that just because everyone else is doing it, you should too.
If you're planning to travel over spring break, there are plenty of ways to do it on a budget. I put together a Vacation Budget Worksheet to help you make a plan for your money so you can focus on enjoying your trip. This worksheet can also help you determine if taking a vacation really is within your budget. If you can't afford it this year, start saving up the cash and go on an amazing spring break next year. The beach will always be there.

Resumen: Israel had to decide whether to be a smaller Jewish state or a binational democracy - or to passively remain a flawed democracy holding millions under oppressive military rule. Most unexpected was the plan announced December 13 by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to do just what burg predicted he wouldn't: withdraw all troops and settlers from Gaza and a corner of the West Bank, either to end pressure for comprehensive withdrawal or, aides said privately, as a first step toward full withdrawal. The sermon that Yom Kippur for the late-morning Musaf service, a climactic moment on the holiest day, was devoted to the shame brought on us a day earlier, when the Syrian ambassador appeared on CNN, quoting from an infamous essay by a renegade ex-Knesset speaker, translated and published by a member of our own minyan.

Texto completo: On Tuesday morning, September II, 2001, I was standing on a Manhattan subway platform, heading for work after voting in the New York primaries. Around 8:55 the platform started buzzing: A plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. Drunk pilot? Errant flight student? My own immediate thought was, "Oh, God, bin Laden has finally done it."
No, I wasn't clairvoyant. When I became the Forward's editor a year earlier, I'd inherited a brilliant young reporter, Rachel Donadio, who'd been following bin Laden ever since he tried to blow up the subway in the 1990s. Now, as the towers were collapsing, Rachel jumped on her bicycle and headed for Ground Zero. The rest of the staff dropped everything and began looking for angles to cover.
That Tuesday, the Forward was transformed. A feisty, independent weekly with its own idiosyncratic angles on the news, it unexpectedly became an important voice on the only story that mattered. Reporters started calling us for leads. Our opinion editor, Oren Rawls, was reeling in op-ed contributions from the likes of Austria's president, Poland's foreign minister and a leading Saudi journalist. The New York Times started lifting our quotes and even whole story ideas, uncredited.
The plain truth was, we were making waves. Even before the 9/11 attacks, Matt Gutman had reported for us from Argentina on the secret Hezbollah training camp near the remote Brazilian border. In 2003 we sent Marc Perelman to Argentina, Paraguay and Chile to report on a second Hezbollah base in a Chilean beach resort. Marc returned to Argentina repeatedly to cover the stalled probe into the deadly 1994 Iran-Hezbollah bombing of the Jewish community's main offices. And in 2005, Marc spent a month in Congo and Uganda, reporting on the genocidal civil wars there, largely outside the world's notice.
Early in 2006, our Nathaniel Popper traveled to Postville, Iowa, to investigate the appalling abuse of the mostly undocumented workers at AgriProcessors, the nation's largest kosher slaughterhouse. His report ignited nationwide protests, some against the slaughterhouse, some against us. As reactions escalated, the plant's CEO landed in jail and the Bush administration launched a massive raid on the plant - not, alas, to protect the workers, but to deport them.
That August, our E.J. Kessler untangled the family secrets derailing the shoo-in re-election bid - indeed, the political career - of the Virginia GOP senator George Allen, the early front-runner for the 2008 GOP presidential nod. Allen had been filmed calling an Indian-American videographer the racist-sounding "macaca." It was speculated to be a variant of a French word for "monkey," perhaps learned from Allen's Tunisian-born, French-speaking mother, Henriette Allen, The senator insisted it was made-up gibberish. E.J. discovered that Henriette Allen came from a prominent Sephardic Jewish clan with roots in Inquisition-era Portugal. Allen angrily protested casting "aspersions" on his mother. Weeks later, his mother told him she was indeed Jewish. He clumsily declared pride in his newfound heritage. It didn't save his career.
For me personally, though, the story that most strongly sums up the Forward experience is one that began quite unexpectedly, in August 2003. I was sitting in a Jerusalem cafe, sipping Java and reading a jaw-dropping essay in the Friday supplement of the daily Yediot Aharonot. It warned that Zionism was on the brink of collapse as its twin "pillars" - "a just path and an ethical leadership" - were failing. Israel now "rests on a scaffolding of corruption, and on foundations of oppression and injustice. As such, the end of the Zionist enterprise is already on our doorstep." Israel had to decide whether to be a smaller Jewish state or a binational democracy - or to passively remain a flawed democracy holding millions under oppressive military rule. The author feared that Israel's leaders were too craven and corrupt to decide. And time was running out.
"It turns out," he wrote, "that the 2,000-year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements, run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies. A state lacking justice cannot survive."
Most astonishing was the name of the author: Avraham Burg, ex-speaker of the Knesset and enfant terrible of the Labor Party.
Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Burg wrote, had bred a callous, deadly indifference. "Israel, having ceased to care about the children of the Palestinians, should not be surprised when they come washed in hatred and blow themselves up in the centers of Israeli escapism."
As I was reading, Burg strolled into the caf�. We bro-hugged and I asked if he'd mind my translating his essay into English and publishing it in the Forward. He agreed.
I called our publisher, Sam Norich, to get a clear go-ahead, knowing that the publication could cost us subscribers. Sam said to go ahead, that this is why we're in business. The translation ran in the Forward the following Friday, August 29.
No one could have predicted the fallout. Within weeks the essay was reprinted around the globe, in the Guardian in London, Le Monde in Paris, in India, Kenya, in dozens of smaller papers, magazines and newsletters. Denunciations poured in from the right and center, damning both Burg and the Forward. Words like Burg's had become commonplace in Israel, in Hebrew. To the outside world, such thoughts - from a senior Israeli politician - were unheard-of.
Most unexpected was the plan announced December 13 by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to do just what burg predicted he wouldn't: withdraw all troops and settlers from Gaza and a corner of the West Bank, either to end pressure for comprehensive withdrawal or, aides said privately, as a first step toward full withdrawal. Several factors were said to have driven Sharon to reverse his lifelong opposition to withdrawal. One, some said, was the shocking worldwide response to Burg's essay in the Forward.
My own life-changing moment had come earlier, on Yom Kippur, October 6. My synagogue was an all-volunteer community with no paid rabbi or staff. Prayers and sermons were rotated among members. The sermon that Yom Kippur for the late-morning Musaf service, a climactic moment on the holiest day, was devoted to the shame brought on us a day earlier, when the Syrian ambassador appeared on CNN, quoting from an infamous essay by a renegade ex-Knesset speaker, translated and published by a member of our own minyan.
A few friends and family walked out in the middle. I sat and listened, more bemused than distressed, feeling like either an outcast, an enemy of the people, or a lone-wolf Humphrey Bog-art-type character, thinking: So, this is what it's like to be a journalist.

We shouldn't politicize the Federal Reserve

Texto completo: Reprinted from The Washington Post.
Small-D democrats by nature, Americans do not favor technocracy - rule by experts. A necessary exception is the Federal Reserve, the central bank, which, also by nature, is a technocratic institution. It takes integrity and common sense, but also highly specialized knowledge, to manage the U.S. money supply, perhaps the most important factor in the global economy. You not only have to know your stuff, economics-wise, but also be willing to follow objective data wherever they might lead, sublimating as much as possible ideological "priors or the interests of your side in partisan politics.
It's therefore alarming that President Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Stephen Moore to one of two open positions on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, for a period that could be as short as five years or as long as 11. Before this, Trump's appointments to the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell included, had been a relative bright spot of the past two years. In contrast to the qualified, mainstream figures previously selected, Moore is no expert; "enthusiast better describes this denizen of conservative think tanks, op-ed pages and green rooms.
Specifically, he is perennially fired up about cutting taxes to boost economic growth - often more fired up than either theory or data would support. Moore is especially over-committed to the notion that tax cuts pay for themselves via increased output. On other matters, he can be flexible, the problem being that he seems to flex according to which party occupies the White House. Relevant example: When Barack Obama was president, Moore denounced the Fed for, as he put it in 2011, pumping out "easy money [that] has become like a narcotic for the U.S. economy. More recently, in December, he demanded Powell resign for allegedly pursuing an overly tight money policy that threatened "the investment, employment and wage-growth spurt Trump policies have created.
Note that in each case, Moore's advice echoed Republican talking points but flew in the face of economic theory, which calls for monetary easing to help recover from recession (as in 2011) and gradual tightening to prevent booms from sparking inflation, as the Powell Fed did last year. As it happens, Moore can claim vindication in the latter case, because Powell has just called a halt to his previous policy. In interviews with major media this week, Moore crowed about that. Simultaneously, he expressed regret ("I was furious - and Trump was furious, too, he explained to the New York Times) for his intemperate earlier trashing of Powell - and for being wrong in 2011.
A .500 batting average on such matters is hardly reassuring, when the source of error was a tendency to grandstand. We have no right to expect perfection in a Fed nominee, but intellectual honesty is not too much to ask. The best evidence that Moore possessed it was his heretofore consistent opposition to protectionism, which he has recently modified to accommodate the president's use of tariffs to pressure China.
In any case, the Fed does not influence trade. Confirming an underqualified self-described "fan of the president would set a bad precedent for future Fed picks and for nominations to other positions that require combined expertise and independence, such as the Supreme Court. Cheerleaders belong on the sidelines.

Texto completo: Before 2013, about one of every 100 immigrants arriving at our borders asked for asylum. Now, it’s one out of every 10.
The glut of immigrants at our southern border has President Donald Trump telling asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico, as he threatens to close the border completely.
"If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug (sic) our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week," Trump posted Friday on Twitter.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has begun performing "direct releases" into the U.S. of some asylum-seekers arriving over the Mexico border because of overcrowding at its two facilities and others run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Lawsuits over immigration policy are nearly as common as tweets.
Some say the increase in people seeking asylum is evidence the world has grown more dangerous. Others say immigrants are abusing the system. Yet, in 2018, 76 percent of those seeking asylum presented enough evidence to pass the initial U.S. screening establishing they had credible fears of persecution in their home countries.
That standard stems from The Refugee Act of 1980, which opened U.S. asylum as a legal process to anyone on the planet with a "well-founded fear of persecution" due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Passing the "credible fear" hurdle by no means indicates asylum will be granted, but it does allow entrance to the U.S. while a case is being heard — a process that now can take years.
"A credible fear referral doesn’t equal asylum status, but it does earn a free ticket into the U.S., allowing individuals to disappear into the interior to live and work illegally," says Jessica Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. "The reality is that our asylum system is being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity, not those fleeing persecution, exacerbating crisis after crisis at our Southern border and keeping those who truly need asylum in the back of the line."
Few immigrants have hope of another route to legally reside in the United States. With caps and quotas on legal immigration by country, even immigrants with family or jobs in the U.S. often must wait years and even decades to be allowed entry. Demand for about 140,000 immigrant worker visas a year far exceeds the supply, and most are available to people with "extraordinary" abilities or advanced degrees.
While asylum requests have soared, the number of people arrested on charges of illegally crossing the border has dropped sharply since 2000, according to The New York Times.
Illegally crossing the border is a criminal offense, but asylum is a matter for civil courts. And that is where change is most needed, says David Iglesias, a Wheaton College professor who prosecuted many criminal cases between 2001 and 2007 as U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico.
"The laws haven’t caught up," says Iglesias, director of the Wheaton Center for Faith, Politics and Economics. Some people seeking asylum might not meet the legal requirements when it comes to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, but they still have a well-founded fear of persecution due to gangs or violence in their homeland, Iglesias said.
Asylum is granted unevenly. Statistics from 2015 show that New York City immigration judges denied 16 percent of asylum requests, while judges in Atlanta denied 98 percent.
And then there is the backlog of cases.
By the end of 2018, there were 325,514 asylum cases pending. In December, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services completed 5,953 cases but received 8,015 new applications. Of those, 1,926 (24 percent) came from Venezuela. Guatemala was second with 716, followed by China with 639, El Salvador with 428, Mexico with 388, Honduras with 378, Haiti with 260, India with 200, Nigeria with 188, Colombia with 161 and a smattering from other countries.
The U.S. has taken in more than 2 million people seeking asylum since World War II, but "we can’t take everybody in," Iglesias says. Instead of spending money on a wall, "we need more immigration judges," who can determine those with legitimate cases, he says.
For fiscal year 2019, Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested $571 million to hire 2,000 immigration officers. The Department of Justice requested $40 million to hire new immigration judges and supporting staff.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration seeks to tighten the "credible fear" guidelines and is turning back some asylum-seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico until their cases can be heard.

Texto completo: Ask someone why they're investing for retirement, and they'll usually give two answers: to cover post-retirement living expenses and to help provide for a spouse after they're gone.
But what if "gone" comes far earlier than you expect? Term life insurance is a great – but often misunderstood – safety net.
Term life insurance is a policy with a fixed end date – usually 10, 20 or 30 years out, depending on when you expect the kids to be out of the house and your nest egg to be sufficient. It is meant to ensure your family can cover funeral expenses, debt and other needs after you're deceased.
I bought a term life insurance policy after my children were born, and think it's a smart move for most families. Those wanting lifelong coverage may find permanent life insurance more beneficial.
Yet industry observers have found many folks don't investigate life insurance options. TermLife2Go, which seeks to help consumers navigate this complex industry, found most people assume life insurance costs three times more than it really does.
Why? Insurance companies can't provide a quote until you answer a slew of questions about your health, habits and lifestyle. It's the verbal equivalent of a colonoscopy. Many fear filling out reams of paperwork or taking medical exams, only to find out they can't afford the insurance. It's a vicious cycle.
Knowing how companies price life insurance helps you cut through that fog. TermLife2Go has a great online resource showing how insurance rates boil down to six factors: age, health, type and term, desired payout, gender and lifestyle.
Age is simple: The younger you are, the cheaper your coverage. Rates start jumping once you hit 40 and rise as you age, with availability more limited the older you get.
Health is the biggest swing factor. Nonsmokers pay less than smokers. Duh! Good family medical histories and healthy body types help, too. The more health issues you have, the more you'll pay. Major illness in your family history can also raise costs.
The type and term of plan you want is something you can control. Term life is generally cheaper than permanent policies – less risk for the insurer. A whole life policy – good until you die, as long as you pay the premiums – costs more. These permanent policies build cash value – excess premium that accumulates within the policy. Folks say they're like savings accounts. Some policies even offer investment options for the cash value. But added costs often make these unattractive.
My advice: You're usually better off buying cheaper term insurance and plugging the savings into your 401(k). But it's a personal choice.
Payout also is within your control and simple: The bigger the payout, the bigger the premium.
As for gender, ladies have it easier. Because a woman has a longer life expectancy than a man, her premium is typically lower. The gap isn't huge, but it is noteworthy.
Finally, lifestyle, is a potpourri. It includes occupation, hobbies, how much you drive and travel (and the relative danger of countries you visit frequently). Folks with high-risk jobs such as loggers and roofers pay higher premiums than office workers. So will those with risky hobbies, including motorcycle riding, wilderness backpacking, rock climbing and boating. If you spend too much time swimming with sharks – or boating in high-risk places – premiums get pricey. Couch potatoes typically pay higher rates than active and athletic folks.
Again, whether and what type of life insurance is right for you depends on you and your family's needs. What I hope you do now is investigate.

Sex, science and secrecy

Texto completo: Before it had a hashtag, the #MeToo movement had already hit science. Geoff Marcy, one of the first astronomers to have spotted a planet outside our solar system, resigned from UC Berkeley in 2015 after he was accused of sexually harassing graduate students. In the years that followed, astronomers at Caltech and Arizona State; a molecular biologist at the University of Washington and another who'd worked at the University of North Carolina and the University of Chicago; a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History; a geologist from Boston University -- the list goes on -- all resigned or were fired because of alleged sexual misconduct.
It's worth noting that many of the universities and other scientific organizations where high-profile cases were exposed are public, taxpayer-funded institutions. That's not to suggest that private university scientists are less predatory, but at public institutions, researchers are held to account by freedom-of-information laws that allow journalists to compel scientists and their institutions to turn over emails and other records. Because private institutions are not subject to state or federal records laws, it can be much harder to prove cases of sexual harassment.
California's Public Records Act is one such freedom-of-information law that allows journalists to keep an eye on taxpayer-funded scientists. And not just in cases of harassment.

The New York Times used freedom-of-information requests to expose how Monsanto and organic-food firms "transformed ivory tower elites into powerful players" who pushed industry-backed initiatives. In Scientific American, I used them to show how medical researchers and their institutions weren't disclosing their ties to pharmaceutical companies as legally required. And in Slate and the peer-reviewed JAMA Internal Medicine, I used them to expose research misconduct, including fraud, in medical studies. Freedom-of-information laws reveal correspondence and other documents that shine a light into shadowy corners of science that would otherwise remain dark.
Yet the California Assembly is considering a bill that would take that tool away. Assembly Bill 700, which faces a judiciary committee vote on Tuesday, would exempt scientists' correspondence and certain other information from disclosure under the Public Records Act. AB 700 is the culmination of a multiyear effort by scientists' organizations and industry groups to cast freedom-of-information requests for correspondence as "bullying" and, ironically, "harassing" researchers.
Transparency can, indeed, be used as a weapon by bullies. One of the most powerful forms of online harassment is "doxing" -- the public posting of personal information. Freedom-of-information requests -- because the laws require a timely response -- can also suck a researcher's valuable time away from doing science. Worse yet, some worry that competitors could use the California Public Records Act to steal valuable scientific secrets.
But these arguments fall apart under closer inspection. There are very few examples of freedom-of-information requests being used to harass scientists. Even when it has happened, the laws give scientists a great deal of protection. Trade secrets are already exempt from most such laws (California's included), as are materials that constitute an unwarranted invasion of the scientist's privacy, and much draft material. Those protections work.
Advocates of changing the California Public Records Act often cite the case of climate scientist Michael Mann, who was subjected to nasty record requests from his time at the University of Virginia. But they don't typically mention that Mann won in the courts, first against the Virginia attorney general (who was making a legal demand, not a freedom-of-information request) and then against partisans who tried to get those same documents through freedom-of-information laws. The courts backed him, and Mann didn't have to release the requested information. Mann did suffer, but the laws ultimately protected him as designed.
For every instance in which freedom-of-information requests are abused, there are many more in which they help expose researchers behaving badly. The changes proposed to the state Public Records Act to shield researchers would hamstring watchdogs, as the American Civil Liberties Union and the California News Publishers Assn. have argued.
At the end of February, the National Institutes of Health -- itself suffering from #MeToo issues -- declared that sexual harassment is "a major obstacle that is keeping women from achieving their rightful place in science" and suggested that embracing "an ethos of transparency and accountability" is crucial to fixing the problem.
As the #MeToo movement in academia has shown, scientists are human, and so they are flawed. Some cheat. Some steal. Some abuse the power of their positions and break the rules that are supposed to keep them in check. Exempting California's taxpayer-funded scientists from the very laws that hold them accountable would be movement in the wrong direction.

Texto completo: Feminist activist Gloria Steinem criticized former Vice President Joe Biden after an accusation that he inappropriately kissed a Nevada politician emerged this week.

“Maybe Biden and other male politicians should observe their female counterparts,” the 85-year-old co-founder of Ms. Magazine wrote in an email to the New York Times on Sunday, adding that since “women candidates are unlikely to hug and kiss men they don’t know, male politicians could refrain from hugging and kissing women they don’t know.”

Lucy Flores, 39, was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014 when she alleges that the former vice president planted “a big slow kiss” on the back of her head without her consent. In a statement, Biden defended his behavior, saying he never thought he was acting inappropriately to women while campaigning or while serving in public office.

Biden, 76, has long history of being touchy-feely with women. He is expected to announce a bid for the Democratic party’s nomination for president in the coming weeks and has been ahead in the polls nationwide.

Texto completo: The enemy of Earth
Climate change is driven more by greed than need, and the fossil fuel industry is public enemy No. 1.
In a New York Times article, “What ExxonMobil didn't say about climate change,” the findings are clear: ExxonMobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications. Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what ExxonMobil's scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private, and what it presented to the general public.
From Bill McKibben, a renowned environmentalist: “What is painfully clear is that the planet does indeed have an enemy – one far more committed to action than governments or individuals. We need to view the fossil fuel industry in a new light. It has become a rogue industry, reckless like no other force on Earth. It is public enemy No. 1 to the survival of our planetary civilization.”
McKibben continues, “This industry holds the power to change the physics and chemistry of our planet, and they're planning to use it. They're clearly cognizant of global warming – they employ some of the world's best scientists, and they're bidding on all those oil leases made possible by the staggering melt of Arctic ice.”
Political will, and a change in corporate behavior, is necessary to reverse this process. Oil corporations that drill and spill must be held accountable and challenged to change their wasteful ways. We can make a more just, cleaner, protected environment if we have the moral and political will to do so.

Our voting system  needs fair redistricting
At the core of our democracy lies our voting system. Think of it like an operating system that runs on your computer or smartphone.
In a well-functioning operating system all your programs, email and social media sites come up seamlessly. You don't think much about the operating system unless it becomes corrupted. Then you realize that things aren't running so smoothly anymore. The same is true of our election system. It is the platform on which our democracy runs, and as long as voting is fair, accessible and verifiable our democracy runs smoothly as each person votes and has their vote counted equally with other voters.
Yet, our voting system can become corrupt and in many instances it has.
One of the most pronounced corruptions of our voting system has been partisan gerrymandering. This is a system whereby one party uses sophisticated analytics and algorithms to carve up districts so that one party will always have an advantage over the other party. When this happens the democratic process is threatened. Our state Legislature is now considering fixing this bug in our system by passing a law that would have nonpartisan commissions draw up our districts so that our elections can stay fair, honest and clean.
Recent polls find that 71 percent of all Americans want these kinds of bipartisan commissions. Let your state senator, legislator and our governor know that you want the same.

Texto completo: Last Sunday, shortly after Attorney General William Barr had released his no collusion/maybe obstruction summary of Robert Mueller's report, I spotted George Conway wandering out of the National Zoo, in Northwest Washington.
George, as anyone even casually familiar with the wacky spectacles surrounding our 45th president is aware, is the prominent conservative lawyer who has been increasingly open about his contempt for Donald Trump, mostly via Twitter. This is notable because he is also the husband of the White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, making him one-half of the marital embodiment of Trump-era Washington -- a seething, divided, bizarre crucible, in other words.
George wore a dark polo shirt and appeared to be alone on this warm afternoon. I imagined him to be depressed over Mr. Barr's synopsis and out for a walk to clear his head while his wife labored triumphantly at the White House. I barely know George. We've met a few times and texted occasionally (like many Washington reporters, I've tried to interview him about his marriage, to no avail). I decided to leave him alone with his thoughts.
He later confirmed (via text) that it was he, but that he was not alone; George said he was shepherding a bunch of kids around the zoo, a task that he compared to herding wild animals. "Or working at the White House," I replied, trying to egg him on. He didn't bite, at least on the record.
George has complained to friends that Kellyanne has fallen inexplicably under the thrall of President Trump -- and that he would prefer a wife who was not captured. Kellyanne, meanwhile, believes that her husband has been disrespectful of her in his public criticisms of her boss, and she wishes he would air his complaints in private. It's obviously more complicated, but those seem to be the broad contours of their grievances.
By all appearances, it had been another belligerent week for the Conways. George had just a few days earlier tweeted out clinical definitions of narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder in reference to the president of the United States. He went on to suggest that "a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man's condition of mind." His wife, all the while, continued to stand by her man -- in this case, the man in the White House.
Kellyanne countered that she did not share her husband's concern for the president's mental well-being, and then added something sarcastic about how she had been taking care of the couple's four children that morning and was engaging in real "substantive" conversations with Mr. Trump so (if you'll excuse her) she might not be fully up to speed on whatever it was her husband was tweeting about that morning.
Naturally, the president himself weighed in, dismissing George -- "Mr. Kellyanne Conway" -- as "a total loser" and the "husband from hell." This was not your standard strange Washington bedfellow shtick, in other words. It was a far cry from the love prevailing over politics meme and Americans learning to disagree without being disagreeable, and all that.
Politics has always loved a good odd-couple story. That the cable combatants James Carville (the Bill Clinton strategist) and Mary Matalin (the Bush and Cheney operative) were married in real life held a certain novelty and quaintness in the relatively tame Beltway soap opera of the 1990s. It could also be marketable. The Carville-Matalin political-enemies/life-partners routine reaped them a fortune of book, speaking, TV and endorsement deals.
But the love-over-politics plotline seems to be another casualty of an administration that has torched even the most time-honored of Washington chestnuts. Far from anything uplifting, the ballad of George and Kellyanne has provided a running background mishegoss to the main noise. George will tweet, with increasing disgust, about the president; people (who pay attention to these things) will notice, and the media will cover it, especially when he takes on a matter relating to presidential scandal, including impeachment, which he had experience with as a prime mover against Bill Clinton's presidency two decades ago.
It's also hard to look away when George seems to implicitly -- or explicitly -- chastise those who still support and enable Mr. Trump (for example, his wife). Members of Team Kellyanne jump on Twitter to retaliate, on her behalf. Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said George was a bad husband, and Eric Trump called his actions "horrible." George told The Washington Post that he was compelled to tweet about the White House "so I don't end up screaming at her," meaning Kellyanne. All totally normal!
At first, it was impossible not to wonder whether the Conways were staging some elaborate marital feud, tailor-made to gin up maximum publicity in the attention vortex that is Donald Trump's White House. Were they positioning themselves for some kind of post-White House "reconciliation" act? You could imagine the joint memoir or reality show or live stage possibilities.
But it is also impossible not to wonder whether their joint memoir is being written in real time, and we are watching a life partnership fracture on Twitter, a casualty of a third wheel in the marriage -- Donald Trump.
This is the part of the story where we call in the authorities to remind us that (slowly, everyone) no one really knows what goes on in the privacy of a marriage. "Hey, I don't live in their house," Mr. Carville cautioned when I reached him by phone in Louisiana, where he and Ms. Matalin have lived for 12 years in apparent harmony (and if not, it would be off-brand, so they would never tweet about it). "They might be the happiest people or the saddest people in the world," Mr. Carville said of the Conways. "Or maybe somewhere in between, like everyone."
Remember, too, that we are living in what's becoming an intensely performative culture, with new outlets for different personas -- one for home; one for work; one for Instagram, cable, etc. Open friction is no longer so easily subsumed by the almighty virtue of comity. "Everybody seems to be playing a certain role, and that should add another layer of skepticism about what's really going on with people," said Gil Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University who has written about political couples.
To strike a more neutral note: Maybe the Conways simply embody the Washington power couple we all deserve in the Trump era. "This marriage represents the train wreck that is our current political culture," Professor Troy said. "We are all intertwined as Americans, like we're all in a marriage together and constantly colliding against one another. No one knows who's going to break first and what will be the breaking point."
We are all the Conways.

Tight lid is put on access to Noor trial

Texto completo: A Hennepin County district judge has imposed tight restrictions on public and media access to the highly anticipated trial of Mohamed Noor, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
With Noor's trial set to begin Monday, Judge Kathryn L. Quaintance cited the need to preserve "order and decorum" in issuing an order this week that places it in a courtroom that holds about two dozen seats -- half the size of some others in the building. The judge reserved eight places for the media and 11 for the public. Quaintance also banned laptops, cellphones and recording devices from the floor on which the trial will take place, authorizing that people be searched to ensure compliance.
The Noor case marks a rare example in the American criminal justice system of an officer going to trial over a fatal shooting, and the first time in modern history a Minnesota police officer has been charged with murder for an on-duty death.
The restrictions pose serious First Amendment problems and will make it difficult for journalists to document the trial, said Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota professor who teaches media law.
"There's been a deliberate decision made here to limit access by the press and public," Kirtley said. "I appreciate the concerns that are being raised here, but it seems to me that [the courts] are overlooking the fact that the public and the press have a First Amendment right of access to a criminal proceeding like this one."
In similar high-profile trials, Kirtley said, judges have consulted with reporters to establish rules without hindering access for journalists or the public.
Quaintance has already prohibited cameras from the courtroom. The court granted media seats based on order of request. The Star Tribune, Minnesota Public Radio, KSTP-TV and KARE-TV are the only local media who secured spots, said District Court spokesman Spenser Bickett. The other four media seats will go to ABC Australia, Channel 9 Australia, the Associated Press and the New York Times.
The families of Noor and Damond will be limited to four seats each in the courtroom. Others will be permitted to observe from an overflow room. Quaintance's original order Wednesday stated that the trial would only be relayed in the overflow room by audio. On Thursday, after protest from media outlets, Quaintance and Hennepin County Chief District Judge Ivy Bernhardson amended the order to allow a video feed to the overflow room.
"Most importantly, it is the Court's role to safeguard the parties' right to fair and public proceedings and the public's right to access them," the order said.
Bickett would not comment on criticisms that the order could hinder First Amendment rights.
Media pushback
On March 15, Star Tribune Managing Editor Suki Dardarian sent a letter to the court raising concerns about potential media restrictions.
Dardarian asked the court to weigh journalists' roles when creating trial rules, offering to meet and discuss how to best navigate the situation. No one took Dardarian up on the offer, and she learned of the order when it went online Wednesday.
"This trial, and what we do when we cover it, strikes at the very core of our democracy and our role as citizens," Dardarian said in an interview. She said it's incumbent upon the press to accurately report what happens in the courtroom, a duty made more difficult by the limited size of the courtroom and restrictions on reporter tools such as laptops and cellphones. Reporters cover court cases across America every day without interrupting the proceedings, she said.
Nancy Cassutt, news director for Minnesota Public Radio, said it's the judge's prerogative to set rules for the courtroom, but she agreed that the restrictions will hinder the media's ability to show the public how the process plays out.
"I think eight seats for the media is too restrictive," said Cassutt. "That doesn't even account for the local media here to cover a story that we've all been covering for a year and a half."
Mark Anfinson, attorney for the Minnesota Newspaper Association, was lobbying the courts Thursday for better media access to the trial, which he said is paramount for covering a case that has captured wide interest among Minnesotans.
"Their only opportunity to learn about it will come through local news organizations," said Anfinson. "And for reasons that remain completely mystifying to me, the Hennepin County District Court seems tone deaf to that reality."

Peter Lucas: No crime by mainstream media, but no exoneration either

Texto completo: What would Joseph Pulitzer say?

He was the New York newspaper publisher who in 1917 established the Pulitzer Prize to be awarded annually to reporters and papers for excellence in journalism.

He was also founder of the Columbia school of journalism, once the gateway for jobs in communications.

The Pulitzer is -- or was -- considered to be the most prestigious award in journalism.

Last year the Pulitzer for National Reporting went to the staffs of the New York Times and the Washington Post, the countries two leading newspapers, for running "deeply sourced" stories on something that did not happen.

That something was Donald Trump and Russian collusion, and the "deeply sourced" stories were phony. It was all a hoax hatched by anti-Trump, pro-Hillary/Obama rogues at the FBI and the Justice Department.

Unfortunately for President Trump and the country, the Trump-hating left-wing media con job of Trump collusion by the papers set the tone for media outlets across the country. They tried to bring down a president on fabricated stories all based on questionable leaks and anonymous sources.

It almost succeeded. And in retrospect, it might have brought down a lesser man, but not Trump, the counter-puncher.

Yet the two papers were able to jointly win journalism's highest honor in 2018 for reporting as fact something that did not happen. And that was the hoax of Trump's collusion with the Russians that allegedly helped him win the 2016 presidential election.

How did that happen? It happened because the two papers control the board that makes the awards, that's how. Talk about collusion.

Of course, the newspapers were not alone in the Democrat-inspired effort to dethrone Trump. News media giants across the nation like NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, CNBC and others joined in as well.

And they were supported by former President Obama officials like John Brennan, former CIA director, who spewed out hate and misinformation about Trump and Russian on a regular basis on CNN.

These news outlets, predicting that Trump would be impeached, or worse, over colluding with the Russians are the same news organizations that told you Trump had no chance of being elected in 2016.

They hated him for proving them wrong, and they hate him still, especially after the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller cleared Trump of allegations that he or his campaign had colluded with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton.

It was a major victory for Trump and a devastating defeat for the anti-Trump main-stream media, which has lost all credibility when it comes to things Trump. Outside of Fox News, the national main-stream media, led by the Times and the Post, is guilty of perpetrating a hoax on the American public.

Grasping for straws, the main stream media and the Democrats (same thing) are hoping that Democrat-controlled House hearings can still bring Trump down on allegations of obstruction of justice.

Mueller, an old hand at Washington bureaucracy and deep state politics, appears to have played it both ways in his report, as outlined by Attorney General William P. Barr in his four-page summary of the report, which has yet to be released.

Keep in mind that in all the world, there is no person as wily as a Washington bureaucrat.

While Mueller cleared Trump of collusion, which made Trump and the Republicans happy, he also threw a bone to the Democrats by keeping the issue of obstruction alive.

Mueller found no conclusive evidence that Trump obstructed justice by firing former FBI director Robert Comey or by doing anything else. But he left the issue unresolved in his report to Barr.

So, Barr, after consulting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded that the evidence of obstruction of justice was "not sufficient" to establish Trump committed an obstruction of justice offense.

But Mueller, being the Washington player that he is, was careful to cover all his bases, and that meant giving the Democrats something they could run with.

After all, he and his family would have been shunned by the Washington Democrat political and social establishment that runs the town had he not done so.

So, on obstruction, Mueller said, "while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."

You can bet the Democrats will make much out of that.

But if Trump did not commit a crime with obstruction, why wasn't he exonerated of that, too?

Maybe the Times and the Post can find out and give themselves another Pulitzer. Or return the bogus ones they got.

'Catastrophic' fungus disease is killing frogs everywhere, linked to 'mass extinction': Study

Texto completo: A rapidly spreading fungus is threatening frogs everywhere, causing mass amphibian die-offs, according to a new study.
The study published online Friday in the peer-reviewed journal Science calls the loss from chytridiomycosis "catastrophic," saying the disease has "caused death and species extinction at a global scale. " At least 501 amphibian species have died over the past 50 years, including 90 that are presumed extinct, the study says.
Chytridiomycosis is caused by two fungal species that likely originated in Asia, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (discovered in 1998) and B. salamandrivorans (discovered in 2013). When contracted, the disease can eat away at skin. It's been known to kill frogs for decades now, but recently its spread has caused global alarm.
Study authors say the outbreak is contributing to "the Earth's sixth mass extinction. " Deaths have been most extreme in wet climates of the Americas and Australia, peaking in the 1980s. Just 12 percent of the declined species are showing signs of recovery, the study notes, as 39 percent continue to decline.
More: More than 40 percent of insect species declining, could have 'catastrophic' results, study says
Wendy Palen, a biologist at Simon Fraser University who is a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study, called the fungus associated with the disease "the most deadly pathogen known to science," The New York Times reports.
Researchers are calling for new research and monitoring to stop the spread of the pathogen, and save at-risk species.

Texto completo: The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that."
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians."
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy."
And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called (Trump's) behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash."
Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: Editor's note: Ask An Editor is an occasional column celebrating LNP’s 225th anniversary. Send Ask An Editor questions to Lori Goodlin, content and production editor, at lgoodlin@lnpnews.com.
About those Opinion pages:
Q: I have been wondering for a long time why there are so many editorials written by those from The Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, etc., with a very strong, liberal slant? Is it because the circulation in Lancaster city far outnumbers the circulation in the very conservative, heavily populated suburbs?
It would seem to me that LNP’s marriage to these columnists is doomed to failure.
------------
A: LNP Opinion subscribes to The Washington Post and The New York Times syndicates precisely because they offer a mix of conservative and liberal column writers. Among the conservatives whose columns, known as op-eds, we regularly publish are Marc Thiessen (who replaced the late, great Charles Krauthammer), George Will, Jay Ambrose, Jonah Goldberg, Christine Flowers, Cal Thomas, Ramesh Ponnuru and Salena Zito. We also have an arrangement with the Heritage Foundation to run columns that appear on its website.
We track the columns we publish daily on a large whiteboard in the Opinion department to ensure we offer a balanced mix over the course of each week. The challenge in recent years is conservatives are not necessarily supportive of President Donald Trump — which can make some of our op-eds appear liberal when they are, in fact, written by conservative writers such as Will and Goldberg.

Getting a grip on personal data

Texto completo: "Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards
of that data." Eva Velasquez President and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center
The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies.
New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said. "To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

U.N. Pleads With Venezuelan Leaders to End Battle Over Aid

Texto completo: Detailing an increasingly desperate situation in Venezuela, the United Nations made a confidential plea on Wednesday to the country's two rival leaders to end a political battle over humanitarian aid that has blocked shipments of food and medicine.
A copy of a report delivered to representatives of both sides, obtained by The New York Times, casts no specific blame for worsening a crisis in Venezuela that by some estimates has plunged nearly the entire population of 32 million into poverty.
But it suggests that measures carried out by the government of President Nicolás Maduro, such as blockading Venezuela's borders and imposing restrictions on aid organizations, have made the crisis more acute, as have sanctions put in place by the United States and others.
The report also suggested that Mr. Maduro's antagonist, Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, also had seized on aid deliveries to try to gain the upper hand, exacerbating tensions by forcing a confrontation in February in which Mr. Maduro repelled an effort to puncture the blockade.
This use of the human suffering as a political weapon by both sides is the greatest impediment to improving conditions for Venezuelans, the report said.

"The politicization of humanitarian assistance in the context of the crisis makes delivery of assistance in accordance with the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence more difficult," the report said.
As much as anything, the United Nations document reads like an entreaty for a country on the brink of ruin.

As much as 94 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the report, and up to seven million people, or a quarter of Venezuela's population, are now in need of humanitarian assistance in a country that was once one of the world's wealthiest.
Millions are without regular access to water, food and medicine. Almost four million people suffer from undernourishment. Crime and disease are flourishing. For many, the only solution is to flee.
It is the kind of collapse rarely seen outside war zones, a senior United Nations official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of the report's findings.
The three-month standoff between Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaidó over who will lead Venezuela is as intractable as ever, and each day more closely resembles the proxy conflicts of the Cold War.
Mr. Maduro, Venezuela's president since 2013, continues to cling to power after his widely disputed re-election last year, bolstered by unwavering support from Russia, which over the weekend sent two military planes to Caracas with supplies and technical advisers.
Mr. Guaidó has been recognized as Venezuela's legitimate president by about 50 countries, including many in Latin America, as well as the United States, which has imposed punishing sanctions in an effort to oust Mr. Maduro.
The Venezuelan people are caught in the middle.
Preventable diseases like tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, malaria and hepatitis A are on the rise, fueled by a shortage of medicines, as well as the doctors to administer them. As many as 22,000 doctors have fled the country, about a third of Venezuela's estimated total, the United Nations report said.
People with chronic diseases are among the most vulnerable. Four million people with diabetes and hypertension lack access to insulin or heart medicine, and 80,000 people with H.I.V. have not received antiretroviral treatment since 2017, a death sentence for most.
Women and older people, indigenous populations and people in rural areas are the most at risk. Children are also suffering. As many as 22 percent of children younger than 5 years face chronic malnutrition, the report said, citing a 2017 survey.
About one million school-age children are not receiving an education as a result of the crisis, and about 48 percent of those enrolled in school are at risk of dropping out because of irregular attendance, the report said.
Rising crime rates have also become a serious concern, the report said, with some indications that Venezuela has become the most violent country in Latin America.
"Violence has increased within households, schools, institutions and in communities, particularly in some border and urban areas where armed groups and common crime organizations are present, the report said.
The solution for many Venezuelans is escape. About 3.4 million people have fled the country, with 1.9 million expected to leave this year, the report said.
The 45-page report was compiled by a consortium of United Nations agencies and local nongovernmental organizations. The political crisis has limited the ability of the United Nations and its partners to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the needs of Venezuelans, it said.
Rural areas in particular are hard to reach, because of poor roads and irregular air service. Since 2015, most public institutions have stopped publishing socioeconomic information.
The report argues that only the United Nations, with its partners, can be a neutral arbiter in the crisis. Funding, however, is an issue. In November, the United Nations put out a call for donations from member states, seeking $109 million to augment humanitarian assistance programs in Venezuela.
That was a modest sum, given the need. But only $50 million has been donated so far.

Texto completo: Collusiongate is now history. The announcement late Friday afternoon that special counsel Robert Mueller had completed his investigation and Attorney General William Barr’s four-page letter released Sunday made it clear: “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

This is not what you expected if you’ve been watching CNN or MSNBC or reading the New York Times or the Washington Post these past two years. Their viewers and readers have been savoring the prospect of Donald Trump being frog-marched out of the White House, on his way to prison, with the smirk wiped off his face.

Now it’s clear that’s not going to happen. The House isn’t going to impeach and the Senate isn’t going to remove. Trump's fate will instead be decided by the voters in 2020. Perhaps his exoneration — not too strong a word — will improve his surprisingly stable poll numbers. Or perhaps not. Certainly he will have greater credibility any time he charges the press with spreading “fake news.”

For that proposition he could cite the leftish journalist Matt Taibbi, who is no Trump sycophant (Taibbi's last book is titled Insane Clown President ). Mueller’s conclusion, Taibbi writes, “is a death-blow for the reputation of the American news media.” In exhaustive detail he lays out how major news organizations repeatedly and unrepentantly “broke every written and unwritten rule in pursuit of this story, starting with the prohibition on reporting things we can’t confirm.”

Reporters and editors often make news judgments based on their guesses of what the underlying truth is. When those guesses are wrong — in this case, spectacularly wrong — they further a narrative that can fairly be called “fake.” Clearly, many in the media thought Collusiongate was their generation’s Watergate, their road to fame and fortune, plus repudiation of a president and party they hated. Instead, it became a road to their own disgrace.

It has been a disgrace as well, as Taibbi argues, for our intelligence agencies. He compares their promotion of Collusiongate with their assurances that Saddam Hussein was seeking weapons of mass destruction. But he doesn’t note one important difference. On Iraq, the intelligence agencies were doing their job as best they could. They subjected the evidence to the pessimistic appraisal that is arguably appropriate in that line of work.

On Collusiongate, the CIA and the FBI were acting contrary to their usual rule of refraining from interference in domestic politics. Instead, as has become clear thanks largely to former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., they were relying heavily on a document bought and paid for by the Democratic National Committee, to the point of presenting it as evidence to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court without identifying its provenance.

That, of course, refers to the now-famous Steele dossier, prepared by the former British spy Christopher Steele, purportedly based on telephone or email conversations with unidentified Russians. If much of it seemed far-fetched, Steele’s employer, FusionGPS founder Glenn Simpson, said Steele could judge the credibility of Russians from afar. But Steele recently confessed that he relied on comments by “random individuals” on CNN’s website, which are not verified by the network. Some sleuth!

“When I read the report, I was in shock,” Taibbi writes of Steele’s work. “I thought it read like fourth-rate suspense fiction.” This shoddy work was evidently the primary or only basis for federal government secret surveillance of an opposition party’s presidential campaign. I’m old enough to remember when liberals looked askance at this sort of thing and didn’t believe that citizens have a patriotic duty to believe every statement by an FBI official.

Some Democrats are now eager to fine-toothed comb Mueller’s full report for evidence against the Trump campaign and to emphasize Russia's undisputed shenanigans. Russians, after all, did indeed hack the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign manager’s email. They tried but failed to hack the Republicans too. This is nothing new: Franklin Roosevelt complained that the Communists opposed him in 1940, during the Hitler-Stalin pact.

I’ve written that the Democrats have been over-invested in Collusiongate and would be wiser to concentrate on other, forward-looking issues. Some Democrats are now urging just that. Put aside the dog-eared copies of the Steele dossier and safely dispose of the Robert Mueller votive candles. Everyone makes mistakes.

But the government officials who promoted Collusiongate should not get off so easily. I’m biased, in favor of respecting elections, and I think that a CIA or FBI director who tries to tilt them his own way should be held morally accountable. Anyone disagree?

Texto completo: Across the U.S., nonpartisan voter-turnout efforts increasingly focus on sparking people to get their friends to vote. This focus is informed by research finding that learning a friend voted boosts their peers’ likelihood of casting a ballot and being encouraged to vote by a friend increases a person’s turnout by eight percentage points.
In fact, experts Don Green and Alan Gerber of Columbia and Yale say, “the frontier of get-out-the-vote research” involves “recruiting people to be responsible for turning out a small group of friends.”
To encourage Montanans to get their friends to vote, the nonpartisan organization Forward Montana piloted a pledge program before a Pearl Jam concert in Missoula last August. With three local nonprofit groups, volunteers canvassed a pre-concert block party outside Washington-Grizzly Stadium and asked people, “Will you pledge to get three friends to vote?”
In two hours, the volunteers got 3,252 of the 10,000 attendees to complete the pledge, which involved sharing their cellphone number and the first names of three friends they would encourage.
According to Forward Montana’s Kiah Abbey, “Many volunteers were initially hesitant to ask block party attendees to get their friends to vote, but people were jazzed to say, ‘Yes’.”
The positive engagement didn’t stop there. Months later, when Forward Montana sent text messages to each pledger reminding them to mobilize their friends, tons replied back saying they made sure their trio voted.
“Compared to other texts we sent, these messages got 10 times the response rates,” Abbey told me. “We know voters are busy and a gentle reminder to ping their friends appears to be something busy people are excited to receive.”
And it appears this simple pledge and text message program had a strong impact. According to TargetSmart (a data firm), 72.4 percent of these individuals were projected to vote in last November’s election. However, 94.8 percent went on to cast a ballot. While numerous factors could explain this 22 percentage point boost in voter turnout, this rise is suggestive that Forward Montana’s program had a strong effect.
While Forward Montana deployed old fashioned clipboard sign ups to activate friend-to-friend voting messengers, the friend-to-friend voter turnout efforts outside of Montana centered mostly on technological-based solutions, like mobilize phone applications.
According to The New York Times, these apps “pull public information from government records” and let users “snoop on which of your friends voted in past elections and ... prod them to go to the polls by sending them scripted messages like ‘You gonna vote?’”
Despite their technological sophistication, these apps got only modest use. For instance, it appears that the most downloaded app saw a mere 841 users within a single congressional district over five months. In other words, in two hours Forward Montana achieved triple the traction in its congressional district than other friend-to-friend voter turnout efforts did over several months.
“In Montana we give one another a helping hand. Our pilot test suggests this friendliness extends to voting, as well," Abbey told me. "We think having non-partisan organization go out and generally promote voting – especially when it’s just vote, and not for a specific candidate – is a great way to make sure more people’s voices are heard in our democracy. Plus, one nice thing about the way we implemented this program is that we can continue to remind these people to get their friends to vote in future elections,”
Moving forward, Forward Montana plans to explore opportunities to spark youth to engage in other types of bite-sized civic actions, like getting three friends to call their state legislature. If this works, we might again learn that nurturing civic engagement rests in marrying a small splash of technology with good old-fashioned relationships.

Texto completo: Picture your book club. Keep the glasses of Chardonnay and hold the laughs at witty takes level, but increase your attendance 20 fold.
That's what the DSM Book Festival hopes to be.
Hitting Capital Square in downtown Des Moines on Saturday, the DSM Book Festival has scored three heavy-hitting headliners — Susan Orlean, Garth Stein and Nnedi Okorafor — and plans a host of literary-themed discussions and classes.
Now, the Des Moines Storytellers Project is proud to announce that we are joining the book-themed fun with an event featuring beloved tales from our archives.
"From the collection: Treasured stories from the Des Moines Storytellers Project" will bow at 6 p.m. on the Prairie Meadows Authors Pavilion and will feature storytellers revisiting pieces that made our first four seasons sparkle.
At the Storytellers Project, journalists with the Des Moines Register coach everyday Iowans to tell true, first-person stories live onstage without notes.
Like a chat around the campfire or a visit among friends, the Storytellers Project celebrates that good stories don't necessarily have to be bound up in a book — an idea that's also central to the mission of this new festival, said Colleen Murphy, downtown events director with the Greater Des Moines Partnership.
"We will have the authors, but a lot of the festival is centered around discussion and celebrating how people love to share stories or what they've read with each other," she said.
Born from the success of smaller book-focused events, The DSM Book Festival is aimed at connecting readers with people who produce work you can read.
Like all good book clubs, the festival is 50 percent literature discussion and 50 percent party.
"When I read a book, one of the more exciting things I love after I finish is to talk with someone about it," Murphy said. "So this festival is bringing that to life in a community celebration."
For more than a year, a committee of citizens, literary folk and business leaders have been planning the event. Throughout the process, they've made a concerted effort to secure authors whose work has transcended the literary scene, Murphy said.
A staff writer at the New Yorker, Susan Orlean has had multiple books land on the best-seller list, including "The Orchid Thief," which was later made into "Adaptation," a film starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Orlean is appearing at the festival as part of the Des Moines Public Library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) event series.
Garth Stein is the author of the perennial book club favorite, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which will be made into a film this year.
And Nnedi Okorafor wrote some of the Black Panther comics that inspired the 2018 Oscar-nominated eponymous film. An award-winning science fiction author when not writing for panels, Okorafor is known for her Africa-based fantasy and myth-infused magical realism young adult books.
Her Akata series, which centers on a young Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can cast spells, was called a "Nigerian Harry Potter" by the New York Times.
In addition to the author talks, there will be a children's stage for young readers and a host of "make and take classes" featuring book discussions paired with a craft.
On the cooking stage, classes will include the Grape Gatsby, a wine tasting with a 1920s theme, and For Whom the Beer Tolls, a lecture on authors and the drinks they loved.
The Des Moines Storytellers Project is currently in its fourth season and has shows scheduled throughout this year. To become a teller or attend a show, visit DesMoinesRegister.com/Storytellers.
The Des Moines Register is a sponsor of the DSM Book Festival.

Texto completo: With the end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, the 2016 election is finally over.
The far left will never accept that Donald Trump is the duly elected president of our country, or that, because he is duly elected by the people, he is, by definition, worthy to be president.
But can the center left, and can liberal Democrats, and much of the press, at last accept the reality of the Trump presidency?
Now that Mr. Mueller has completed his work, can Mr. Trump's political opponents admit that, because they disagree with Mr. Trump on policy or tactics, it is not also necessary to criminalize and demonize him?
Can they even admit that some people who voted for Mr. Trump are rational and decent human beings?
We now have it officially: The president did not collude with the Russians to undermine the 2016 presidential election.
It was always a ludicrous charge, legitimized mostly by hysteria, and additionally, sadly, much of the mainstream media, which lost its perspective utterly with regard to Mr. Trump. The press permanently diminished itself and destroyed much of its credibility in covering the president.
Most Americans knew in their bones that the collusion story was absurd.
Mr. Mueller also found no real evidence of obstruction of justice. How could he? Perhaps one can obstruct the investigation of a non-crime (and there was inadequate evidence even of this), but it would be a trick. The attorney general said there must be an underlying crime to obstruct.
The Mueller verdict changes things politically, and significantly, for Mr. Trump. But will it change him? Will he let go of 2016 and all of his anger about the Mueller probe and begin to act, consistently, with a grace and statesmanship worthy of his office?
Most of the things the president does to hijack his message and his presidency are matters of tone and taste. And almost all are unnecessary. A person with great power can afford to be generous and restrained.
Mr. Trump didn't have to attack Robert Mueller, for Mr. Mueller was, it turned out, a pretty straight-up guy, and that rarest thing among prosecutors - one willing to say, "There is nothing substantial here." Mueller did his duty.
That said, the entire Mueller report should be released to the public. This is indisputable.
So, now that the great snipe hunt, and the 2016 election, are both finally over, will we see a measure of reserve from the left or from the White House? It is doubtful. The 2020 election is upon us.

1967 'Be-In' In the Park That Set A Standard

Texto completo: They came wearing crowns of daffodils in their hair, their foreheads painted rainbow blue and gold as they strolled through Central Park, kites drifting overhead. It was March 26, 1967, and more than 10,000 New Yorkers from Brooklyn to the Bronx gathered for a "Be In" on Easter Sunday to spread a message of love and tolerance.
Attendees covered a police car with flowers. They chanted, "L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E," and strummed guitars as police officers kept a watchful eye. Women showed off their Easter bonnets. The New York Times described it at the time as "noisy, swarming, chaotic and utterly surrealistic." For many it was a reminder that Central Park was a unique place for people to gather in a country divided by race, politics and women's rights. It was front-page news.
Indeed, a month later, crowds would gather again, but this time their message was more pointed: End the war in Vietnam. That is why the Be-In from March 1967, inspired by an earlier one in San Francisco, was a singular event.
"It represents a cultural moment in our history," said Marie Warsh, a historian for the Central Park Conservancy, which oversees management of the park. "Central Park became an epicenter of the counterculture in New York, where different people from all walks of life could gather."
Sure, there were later Be-Ins or happenings in the 1960s. The subsequent rally in 1967 was part of the "Spring Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam" and ended with a march to the United Nations, where orators like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke against war. A year later, a peace rally and another Easter Be-In were combined. By 1969, though, the gatherings had become explicitly political.
Jeanne Gutierrez, a curatorial scholar at the New-York Historical Society, said protesters built bonfires and left mountains of trash, leading to complaints that revelers were ruining Central Park. City officials "got pushback about the Be Ins," Ms. Gutierrez said. New Yorkers debated whether Central Park should be a place of protest or an oasis of contemplative beauty.
The March 1967 Be-In was not planned as a political protest. Thomas Hoving served as parks commissioner for a year leading up to the Be-In before becoming director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He had championed a series of "Hoving Happenings," with concerts and festivities, to get more people to enjoy the city's green space. "He wanted to make the parks a democratic space," Ms. Gutierrez said.
The Be-In was organized by James Fouratt, an actor; Paul Williams, a magazine editor; Susan Harnett, an art administrator; and Claude Badal, a poet and playwright from Chile. According to The Times, the four raised $250, which they spent on posters that appeared in Greenwich Village, the East Village and Harlem. (Some were printed in Spanish.) Two newspapers, The Village Voice and The East Village Other, promoted it, as did local radio stations. But it was largely word of mouth that made New Yorkers show up at the Sheep Meadow.
"We wanted to be a celebration of being alive," Mr. Fouratt said at the time. "People in New York don't look at each other, don't see each other, don't talk to each other."
They arrived in the morning with drums, bells and bubbles for blowing, the sound of music lilting in the spring air. Sunday strollers, some who came after the Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue, stopped and gawked.
"Isn't the young generation awful?" a woman wearing egg-shaped gold earrings and a crown of flowers told The Times. "What are they coming to? In my generation things were never like that."
The Be-In was modeled after one two months earlier in San Francisco, which was attended by tens of thousands of people to celebrate personal empowerment, youth culture and higher consciousness (often aided by drugs).
"They wanted to create good energy," Ms. Gutierrez said of the New York attendees. "It was not dominated by personalities. It was much more organic. People were in costumes. Everyone shared food."
Subsequent Be-Ins, though, raised the question: Who was allowed to congregate in Central Park? And what was the cost? "Within a few years of that first Be-In, people were up in arms," Ms. Gutierrez said. "They hated seeing hippies in Bethesda Fountain."
Attitudes toward Central Park changed as city officials made it harder to hold large-scale political events, Ms. Warsh, the historian, said. The city began to ask organizations to pay for permits as well as the cost of cleanup and salaries for police officers. "It was complicated," she said.
As donors, too, paid millions of dollars to refurbish Central Park, major protests dwindled, with a few exceptions. In June 1982, hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators rallied against nuclear weapons at a concert attended by, among others, the singers Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen, and Coretta Scott King, Dr. King's widow.
Large gatherings were often funded by corporate sponsors who could foot the bill. In recent years, throngs have gathered in awe to hear Beyoncé, Coldplay and other musical acts play at the Global Citizen Festival to end world poverty. "A lot has changed in Central Park since the 1960s," Ms. Warsh said.

Texto completo: 2020 Presidential Race
We're tracking the Texas stories in the presidential contest, from the Texans in the race to all candidates' efforts to reach voters and raise money in the state. We've also compiled stories from our archives related to Texans running for president.
More in this series
Editor's note: This story has been updated with a statement from Beto O'Rourke.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke has hired veteran strategist Jennifer O’Malley Dillon as his campaign manager.
"We're excited that Jen O'Malley Dillon has joined our team," O'Rourke said in a statement Monday. "Her leadership, experience and creativity will be a great addition to a campaign that is already doing so much to bring people together to overcome the greatest set of challenges this country has ever faced."
O’Malley Dillon was deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election bid. Before that, she served as executive director of the Democratic National Committee.
"I’m so excited to join the [O'Rourke] team and get to work building a campaign that will lift people up and unite them to meet our challenges, and that will show up everywhere and listen to & value every voice," O'Malley Dillon wrote in a tweet, sharing a New York Times story that first reported her hiring.
Since announcing his White House run earlier this month, O’Rourke has faced questions about his campaign leadership, which he has said will be made up of people from his 2018 U.S. Senate bid as well as some fresh faces. He told reporters a few days after he entered the 2020 race that he was “working on it” with regard to a campaign manager.
The hiring of O'Malley Dillon signals that for his White House bid, O'Rourke is willing to look beyond the inner circle he kept during his U.S. Senate campaign against Republican Ted Cruz. For that race, his campaign manager was a political novice and family friend, Jody Casey.

Kremlin propaganda pushes U.S. 'civil war' message; Divisive comments by Trump aid Putin

Texto completo: The Kremlin-controlled Russian media have been trumpeting the news of the U.S. college admissions scandal, grossly exaggerating its scale.

Since before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Kremlin has been pushing a manufactured issue of prospects of a civil war in America, claiming that white blue-collar workers in the country are getting increasingly disenfranchised.

Most recently the Kremlin has used the college admissions scandal to back up its claim. One of its propagandists' favorite talking points is that Collegegate has eclipsed Russiagate and the Mueller investigation.

President Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine lays an unsubstantiated claim that there is hardly a university in the United States that's not mired in corruption. The allegation is that the universities - the famous American social elevators - are broken, which makes the social divide between the haves and the have-nots unbreachable under the existing political system.

The Kremlin propaganda further maintains that the have-nots in the American society are getting increasingly and irreversibly cognizant of that social divide and disillusioned of the American dream, which the Kremlin claims is dead.

So Mr. Putin has been pushing that narrative through the news channels and the social media to suggest that a civil war in the United States is inevitable.

The message is an easy sell to the rank and file in Russia because Mr. Putin controls the television, from which about 70 percent of the Russians get practically all their news and commentary, according to a recent poll by Russia's independent Levada Center.

It is also quite believable to most Russians because of the all-pervasive, systemic corruption in Russia, not in the least in the universities, where about half of students admit that they are aware of bribery in their respective colleges, according to the Russian media. So it's easy to imagine for the Russian public that America is no different.

The American public, by and large, is another matter however.

Kremlin propagandists are savvy enough to know that.

So - since well before the 2016 election - they've been differentiating their message, separately targeting the left and the right in the United States with inflammatory rhetoric and fake-news messages, repeatedly employing the term civil war.

That serves the Kremlin's ultimate goal to weaken the United States to the point where it gives up its global leadership - just as the U.S. intelligence services have warned us.

Mr. Putin believes that would make his position and stature inside and outside of Russia more secure.

The main tools the Kremlin has relied upon in promoting that message in the United States are its official television channel Russia Today and social media.

Fortunately, their credibility is flawed because they are traceable back to Russia - thanks to the pushback in the U.S. mainstream media.

Unfortunately, though, the Kremlin has a booster who periodically sends out effectively the same message and who according to opinion polls is credible to about 40 percent of the U.S. public - President Trump, who often makes what some deem as divisive statements, which at times seem to echo the Kremlin message.

One of Mr. Trump's recent pronouncements of that sort was made this month in an Oval Office interview with writers from Breitbart, a right-wing news site.

Said Mr. Trump, according to the New York Times: You know, the left plays a tougher game. It's very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don't play it tougher. OK? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump.

I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough - until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.

Mr. Trump appears to be threatening violence should the Democrats continue to oppose him.

A U.S. president is supposed to speak to and represent all Americans, and not just his base, and be a uniting force as opposed to a dividing one.

As long as we don't have a president who does, the Kremlin propaganda will remain a threat to our society.

Choose college that fits, not one meant to impress

Resumen: College basketball and college admissions. Earlier this month, our nation witnessed a college bribery scandal in which wealthy families were caught paying millions of dollars to guarantee their children’s admission into our nation’s elite universities. According to the Times, they found that "after statistically controlling for students’ SAT scores, economic background and college ambitions, the long-term financial returns are 'generally indistinguishable from zero.'

Texto completo: One of my former colleagues believes March is the most unpredictable month. Among the reasons: College basketball and college admissions.
March Madness is billed as one of the biggest, most exciting and most fun events in all of sports. The NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament is a single-elimination tournament of 68 teams that compete in seven rounds for the national championship. The penultimate round is known as the Final Four.
This time of year is also a time of madness for high school students and their families, waiting to find out the outcome of the college admissions process. It’s when you hear back from universities to see where your student has been accepted.
As the father of two college graduates, I know it’s a hectic, crazy time because everyone wants the best for their children. The eight Ivy League schools — Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale — had a total of 281,060 applicants for the class of 2021. Less than 10 percent were admitted.
Earlier this month, our nation witnessed a college bribery scandal in which wealthy families were caught paying millions of dollars to guarantee their children’s admission into our nation’s elite universities. Those kids got in through the “side door.”
A recent article in The New York Times suggests that "these efforts are mostly a waste of money, and that the seized opportunities would have actually helped other students much more."
In 2014, economists Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger (who died tragically March 16) published an analysis of the benefits of attending a highly selective college. According to the Times, they found that "after statistically controlling for students’ SAT scores, economic background and college ambitions, the long-term financial returns are 'generally indistinguishable from zero.' Students who are poised to succeed tend to do so even if they don’t get into the Ivy League."
Clearly, there is the possibility of achieving excellence without elitism.
While you are waiting for that “right” acceptance letter or maybe your child hasn’t applied yet, I’d like to suggest that a good fit for your child is one of the most important factors for selecting a college. The college needs to speak to both the heart and mind of your child. Do the values of the college match the values you’ve instilled in your child?
From my years in academia and raising two daughters, I’ve come to believe that there are important questions that can help students select a college that is a good fit.
Does it have the major your student wants? What are the placement rates and career outcomes of that major? Does it have the athletic or intramural program in which your student participates? Does it have clubs and organizations that will bring out the best in your student? Will the teachers be graduate assistants or full-time professors?
You also may want to consider if you’re pushing your student toward a decision that is driven by your own sense of what is the best college for your child. Some parents hover around their offspring whether they are at school (including university) or at work. They run interference and solve problems for their children — and now we’ve learned some parents will even take illegal actions to push their kids ahead of others. Parents nowadays try to serve as buffers for any glitches — from low marks to low salaries — their kids may face.
By letting children learn to deal with their own problems, however, and allowing them to make their own choices, they will have the requisite skills to navigate through college and life beyond.
I suggest you let go of the drama playing out in the national media and let your student determine which college is a good fit for him or her. Stop looking at name brands and instead, look at campuses holistically and listen to your child. Will your child be happy? Will he or she feel a sense of community? Will he or she be able to find a career?
Ultimately, our children’s future lives will be greatly influenced by the foundation they build in the college they choose. We are blessed with different types of colleges in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in our region more specifically, and parents should not overlook them as they send their students off to the next stage of their lives. For some students, none of the local colleges will be a good fit and that is fine. But it is not a stretch to say we have colleges here that are not elitist, but are certainly excellent

Apple plans to launch streaming service with big actors - and budgets

Texto completo: Last fall, Howard Gordon, showrunner for the hit TV show "24" and co-creator of "Homeland," was in the middle of negotiating a deal with a newcomer to Hollywood: Apple. In a meeting with film executives from the iPhone maker, which had set aside an enormous budget to develop TV shows and movies, Gordon brought up rumors that Apple wanted sanitized projects - a potential problem for his show about a pair of disillusioned military veterans who go on a killing spree.
Would Apple buy the project, an adaptation of an Israeli show called "Nevelot," which translates directly to "Bastards," only to strip it of any violence and adult themes? "They were fairly adamant that it would not be a problem," Gordon said in an interview. "I said, 'Can you say that again into the microphone,' " Gordon said. He sold the show, which stars Richard Gere, to Apple and it is in early development.
After initially faltering, Apple plans to launch its much-anticipated streaming service Monday, which includes big-name actors such as Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. It represents a tectonic shift in Apple's business model: Diversifying from hardware such as iPhones and MacBooks and diving headfirst into subscription businesses like cloud storage, music, movies and television. It is also expected to launch a news subscription service Monday featuring publications such as the Wall Street Journal. (The Washington Post and the New York Times turned down Apple's offer to take part in the subscription offering, according to people briefed on the plans. Both publications declined to comment.)
But in Hollywood, Apple must hone its identity and reputation in an entertainment market crowded with competitors, like Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney. It's using its deep pockets to buy itself a name in Hollywood. Apple is paying Witherspoon and Aniston about $1.1 million an episode each, according to a Hollywood executive with knowledge of Apple's plans. Apple has nabbed other high-priced stars, such as Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia," who will headline a new Apple show about video game developers. Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster projected Apple would spend $4.2 billion on original content by 2022.
And it must decide whether it wants to make its content available only on its own devices - an incentive to remain in the Apple ecosystem if the content is compelling enough - or license it to attract a wider audience. Apple has made its Apple Music service available on Amazon Echo devices and plans to make iTunes content available on televisions made by Samsung and others.
Apple has been trying to shed the notion that it is different because it hails from Silicon Valley. Following some criticism for early original programming shown on its Apple Music app, Apple hired a team of Hollywood insiders known for popular and critically acclaimed shows and movies, which helped bolster its credibility.
Still, Apple has no Hollywood track record, and people who have inked deals with the company described the decision as a leap of faith in Apple's ability to execute on its plans and deliver big audiences.
"Apple is the only company in the world that can drop a couple million dollars in entertainment and get Reese Witherspoon and M. Night Shyamalan on board without any articulation of a plan in terms of marketing or distribution," said one well-connected Hollywood executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to upset Apple.
"There's a certain amount of good faith or breath-holding that both of us are doing," Gordon said.
So far, Apple is proving willing to produce shows that are "edgy" and that include content that might not be suitable for children.
But the Hollywood executive said Apple CEO Tim Cook has passed notes to writers on Apple shows through the company's Hollywood executives. "Tim is paranoid about anything that affects his brand," the Hollywood executive said.
Now that Apple is becoming its own film studio, it's in direct competition with other services. According to data from Reelgood, a streaming app that acts as a guide for finding content, U.S. households on average use 4.2 streaming services, dominated by Netflix.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said earlier this week that Netflix content would not be part of Apple's new streaming product, meaning people will need to watch Netflix shows by opening up the Netflix app itself.
Apple so far has inked about 30 deals for content, according to industry-tracking databases, and will be dwarfed by its competitors.
Apple's streaming plans, which began in the summer of 2017 with shows on the Apple Music app, got off to a rocky start. Its first show, "Planet of the Apps," a reality TV show that featured Silicon Valley founders and investors, was panned by critics. Its show "Carpool Karaoke" struck a chord with viewers and earned an Emmy.
The first drama Apple planned to release starred Dr. Dre and was loosely based on his life. Dr. Dre has ties to Apple through his music streaming and headphone company Beats, which he sold to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion.
Apple decided to shelve the Dr. Dre show, according to Hollywood executives with knowledge of the show. Apple has never confirmed publicly that it planned to release the show, and an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Apple's Hollywood division, which still has no official public title, is now run by Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, who came from Sony and are known for backing hit shows like "Breaking Bad."
But Apple also has the power of a distributor of entertainment, setting it apart from studios.
Where Apple's new shows will and won't appear is one question show creators said they asked Apple during discussions. They said they were met with obfuscation and ambiguous responses. It's unclear how long after Monday's anticipated announcement of the streaming service it will actually launch. According to one person briefed on the matter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, Apple has even considered distributing its original content outside of its own platform, a sign that the hardware maker is considering a plethora of options as it grows into new businesses.
All this has led to some uncertainty among people creating shows for Apple, who said they'd be watching Monday's event with interest to find out more details about how their productions would reach audiences. "As long as they are paying us, we will take their money," the Hollywood executive said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A day after House Democrats retook the majority, Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a mssage to her colleagues that would soon be adopted as a creed.
"We know that the diversity in our rank is a strength," Pelosi wrote "and a reflection of the Ameican people that it is our great honor to serve."
She was imploring them to adopt the National Football League's practice of interviewing a minority candidate for senior positions. Her letter was an acknowledgment of alongheld truism on Capitd Hill - while Congress has long been remarkably racially homogeneous, perhaps nowhere has that been more apparent than among the ranks of Capitol Hill staff, regardless of party. Dispite an increasingly dierse House, the staff empoyed by those members are not only less ethnically dverse than the country, but less diverse than the members who employed them.
That is changing in the most racially diverse House in history, a record number of top Democratic aides are men and women of color, including the speaker's national security adviser and the majority whip's chief of staff.
In September, 137 percent of top aides in the House were minoities, according to reseach by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based research center. Bolstered by hires made by new members of Congress on both sdes of the aisle, that number has risen to 20.9 percent, the center said - by no neans transformative but a noticeable shift in halls of power that have always been disproportionately white.
When Rep. Hakeen Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 Democrat, announced his roster of lieutenantsearlier this month, 6 of 8 were people of color, four of them women, including his chief of staff.
"The diversity of experience and backgrouncof our new senior team reflects the gorgeous mosaicof the Democratic Caucus," Jeffries, who is Black, sad in a statement.
As House Democrats pursue an aggressive agenda, holding high-profile oversight hearings and passing legisation on health care, campaign finance transparency, and gun control, these aides are influencing major policy decisions, shaping messages and leading the staffs of nearly half a dozen committees, including the powerful Ways and Means and Appropriations panels.
"It is a best business practice," Kemba Hendrix, director of the House's diversity initiative, said. "If we're looking to create policy that impacts people from different frameworks, we have to be able to do that" with aides with diverse backgrounds.
Spencer Overton, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, said the prominence of minority aides is as important as the quantity.
"This change in focus in terms of leadership is important," he said.
"We need diversity in big tech, on corporate boards. With Congress, however, the primary function is to represent people," Overton continued. "So the failure of members of Congress to hire diverse staff and diverse top staff re.ally goes to their dysfunction as an institution."
The diversity expansion did not happen on its own. Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, who is white and is chairman of the House Rules Committee, expanded a diversity initiative established last Congress by the Democratic Caucus to the entire House as part of a rules package approved when the Democrats took control.
Pelosi, who is white, hired Hendrix to lead the House Democratic Diversity Initiative when she was House minority leader last year. Now that Democrats are in the majority, Hendrix assists all House offices with improving their hiring practices and creating a pipeline of diverse aides. In addition to fielding questions and conducting one-on-one sessions with offices, she oversees a resume bank curated in collaboration with the Democratic Caucus that helps pull in candidates from traditionally neglected networks, such as historically black colleges.
"This is a place where who you know does, at times, affect how you are able to access employment," Hendrix said. "The ability to access networks and become familiar within those networks takes time."
Wyndee Parker, Pelo'si's African-American national security adviser, recalled, "when the speaker was first elected in early 2007, I started looking around and recognizing that I was seeing more women and more minorities in key roles."
"There has been some improvement since that time, and I'm happy about that," she added, "but I think that we still have a ways to go."
For one thing, the Republicans have hot kept the same pace. In their leadership offices, there are far fewer minorities. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, who is white and is the Republican leader, employs an Asian-American deputy chief of staff, and Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama, who is white and the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, employs an African-American chief of staff. Neither aide was available to comment.
The implications of having a diverse staff are significant. Top aides have the ear of members. Crucial to establishing a pipeline of diversity, they are also responsible for hiring decisions. Top aides often go on to jobs in the executive branch or run for Congress themselves.
Creating a pipeline is particularly important for young minority professionals, diversity experts say. For years, internships - one of the first opportunities to make connections on the Capitol Hill - were unpaid, thinning the applicant pool by affluence. And the social networks that can make or break getting jobs in congressional offices have long been historically white.
Shuwanza Goff, the first African-American woman to direct action on the House floor, recalled entering rooms full of men, many with more experience than her, and having to tell them "what the plan is."
"That was challenging for me and something to grapple with," she said.
Brandon Casey, the first minority staff director of the Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged that there was a stigma against people of color in top staff jobs "because they haven't done it before."
As staff director, he is responsible for hiring interns and full-time employees, and he makes a point of challenging his lieutenants to find candidates "outside of the traditional networks."
"We're not only showing staffers that they can rise up to the job," Casey said, "but showing all members that we can do this job."

Ex-Georgetown tennis coach in alleged college bribery scam seeks greater freedom of travel

Texto completo: Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst wants permission to travel throughout the country to look for work and care for elderly relatives while his case in the college admissions cheating scandal is pending.
Lawyers for Ernst, a 52-year-old Cranston, R.I., native with homes in Chevy Chase, Md., and Falmouth, made the request Thursday in a brief motion in US District Court in Boston, where the veteran coach faces a racketeering conspiracy charge in connection with the high-profile case.
While coaching at Georgetown over a period of several years, Ernst allegedly collected bribes totaling $2.7 million in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He's free on $200,000 unsecured bond and scheduled to make his initial appearance in federal court in Boston on Monday, according to legal filings.
On Thursday, Ernst's lawyers asserted that his current pretrial release conditions, which restrict his travel to Maryland and Massachusetts for court appearances, lawyer meetings, and pretrial supervision, are tighter than conditions for the other 49 defendants in the sprawling case.
And, the motion said, Ernst has surrendered his passport and is not a flight risk. He has known about the probe since at least December 2017, according to the motion.
“Mr. Ernst has a legitimate need to travel throughout the continental United States," the filing said, noting that he plans to reside at his Cape Cod home when he's required to appear in federal court in Boston. “Mr. Ernst must also frequently travel to Rhode Island to care for his elderly mother and to Florida to care for his elderly mother-in-law, as both women live alone."
In addition, the motion said, Ernst “has been actively seeking employment since being placed on leave by his current employer [University of Rhode Island]. Mr. Ernst works as a tennis professional and anticipates finding employment in California or Florida due to the warmer climates in those states."
Prosecutors hadn't responded to the motion as of Friday evening.
Ernst hails from Rhode Island, according to a 2006 press release from Georgetown announcing his appointment as coach.
“He was the only athlete to win four straight Rhode Island High School State Tennis Championships in both singles and doubles and in 1985 the Cranston, Rhode Island native was the team captain of the United States Junior Davis Cup Team Camp," the release said. “In 2000, Ernst was inducted into the Cranston, Rhode Island Athletic Hall of Fame and in 2003 he was inducted into the Rhode Island Interscholastic League Hall of Fame."
The 2006 release also noted that Ernst had served since 2002 as executive director of Vineyard Youth Tennis on Martha's Vineyard.
Ernst served previously as a tennis instructor to former first lady Michelle Obama, according to a 2014 story in the New York Times, which quoted Ernst as saying that Obama had “a big backhand."
Georgetown has said that Ernst was no longer coaching there as of December 2017, “following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions." He was hired by URI in August 2018, but the school confirmed earlier this month that he had been placed on leave because of the probe.
Ernst is one of 50 defendants charged in the scheme in which dozens of wealthy parents, including Hollywood stars and captains of industry, allegedly cut fat checks to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at prestigious schools, paving the way for their acceptance.
Some parents also allegedly ponied up cash to facilitate cheating on their children's SAT and ACT exams.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated when Gordon Ernst last coached at Georgetown. It was December 2017.

Texto completo: My gocd friend and neighbor, Krista, has been cooking up a storm as part of her New Year resolutions. She graciously invites me over to eat and drink exceptional wine on the regular. I am forever grateful.
Krista picks her vegetarian recipes at random, but boy she has not missed the mark yet. Here is the first of two from New York Times Cooking that had me coming back for more, more, more. The recipe, from Melissa Clark, gives me rich memories of my Italian vacation eating ribollita in Tuscany.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling
2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
1 small fennel bulb or 2 celery stalks, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
Pinch crushed red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary(optional)
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth (or water)
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
¾ cup roughly chopped cherry or grape tomatoes
½ cup whole-wheat or regular orzo
1 quart loosely packed baby mustard greens or spinach (about 5 ounces)
Salt and freshly cracked black pepper
Chopped scallions, for garnish (optional)
¼ cup finely grated ParmigianaReggiano cheese, more as needed
In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, fennel or celery, and onion. Cook until tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper and rosemary, if using and cook another 2 minutes. Pour in the broth if using or water, plus an additional 2 cups water and bring to a boil.
Once the mixture is boiling, add the chickpeas, tomatoes and orzo. Reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid. Simmer 10 minutes, or until the orzo is tender. Uncover and stir in the greens, letting them simmer until soft, about 2 minutes.
Add more water if you want the mixture to be more soup like, and season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and top with chopped scallions (if desired), grated cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.
Krista's only NOTE is to cook the orzo in the broth until just al dente and the starch has released itself. Strain and reserve separately until you are ready to serve... and to finish the whole thing with a big pat of butter. 1 concur!
Happy eating and thanks for reading!

Jodi Kantor Talks Weinstein, #MeToo at Temple

Texto completo: Headnote MEDIA
ATTENDEES PACKED Temple University's Mitten Hall on March 14 to hear Jodi Kantor, who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal, detail how she and colleague Megan Twohey investigated the story that served as the impetus for the #MeToo movement.
"The thing we concentrated on, our investigative design, involved getting as many different kinds of evidence as possible," said Kantor, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the topic. "We were not looking to write a 'he said, she said' story, in which - and I'm talking about once we really understood the material and we were hearing a lot of things off the record - we did not want to write a story that felt like a contest."
Agrande esta imagen.

David Boardman, dean of Temple's Klein College of Media and Communication, interviewed Kantor at "Our #MeToo Moment and Beyond," which was co-sponsored by the Feinstein Center for American Jewish History.
Kantor said her investigation into Weinstein began after a turning point in sexual harassment history in April 2017, when a New York Times article found that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly had paid $13 million over the years to settle sexual harassment suits against O'Reilly.
"It's easy to say from our vantage point now, 'Oh, that was so many sexual harassment stories ago,' but that was really a seminal story because the history of this issue was a history of lack of accountability," said Kantor, who is Jewish. "If you look at people like Clarence Thomas and Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump, there were allegations against all of these men and they never really faced any accountability for this."
But the case with O'Reilly proved different. The journalists were able to show a trail of money that proved the case and, two weeks later, O'Reilly was fired.
That's when The New York Times editors began asking if there were other powerful men who had covered up inappropriate treatment of women - a question that seems quaint today, Kantor said. They asked Kantor who should be investigated next, and after some digging, she suggested Weinstein.
During the talk, she explained how she and Twohey went about trying to craft the story, and how they navigated some of the challenges in reporting it.
They decided, for example, that they needed to reach the women who had been harassed or assaulted directly, without an intermediary like a publicist or an agent. They didn't want to risk the intermediary putting a stop to the story. Getting the womens phone numbers was a difficult task, but the hardest part was convincing the women to speak on the record.
That Kantor and Twohey were trying to prove there was a pattern of harassment and cover-ups helped convince some women.
Boardman noted during the conversation that he, Kantor and Weinstein were all Jewish.
"I must ask this: So along the way, did Jewishness ever occur to you as a connection of the story?" Boardman asked. "In fact, unfortunately, several of the most prominent men who have been swept up in this are Jewish. Has that been a cultural aspect, a cultural exploration for you in any way of this story?"
"What's been very clear to me through our reporting is that this is a problem in every culture, every community, every walk of life," Kantor said. "Different communities have their own anxieties and neuroses about what happens when somebody in their world is accused of this. In the AfricanAmerican community, there is so much angst about Bill Cosby. He was an absolute hero, and now with R. Kelly, it's very uncomfortable for a lot of African-Americans to see a black man who was so successful accused ... and certainly the Jewish community has had some of the same reactions."

El Salvador Considers Amnesty for Those Accused of Crimes During Its Civil War

Autor: Raymond Bonner for.

Texto completo: Legislators in El Salvador are considering granting amnesty to those accused of crimes committed during the country’s brutal civil war in the 1980s. The legislation would drop all ordinary criminal charges arising from the war, and it would shield anyone convicted of war crimes from imprisonment.
The move by conservatives in El Salvador’s Parliament comes as 20 former senior military officers have been charged with an array of crimes, including murder, rape and kidnapping. In December, a judge cleared the way for the men to also be tried on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Lawmakers succeeded once before in adopting legislation granting wide amnesty to those accused of often ghastly crimes during the war. In 1993, the Parliament voted to block prosecution of crimes committed during the war, a law that remained in place until the country’s top court ruled it unconstitutional in 2016.
Last Saturday, the families of four American Roman Catholic missionaries raped and murdered by soldiers during the civil war sent an open letter to Salvadoran legislators urging them to vote against any proposed new amnesty. The next day, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador issued a statement calling on legislators to reject what has come to be called the Law of Reconciliation. He called it “totally unjust” and said that “instead of protecting and consoling the victims,” it would “protect the perpetrators, granting them impunity.”
The current American ambassador, Jean Manes, did not respond to a request for comment on the possible legislation.
But Manes has supported prosecution of the 20 former military officers. The accused officers include members of the Atlacatl Battalion, the Salvadoran army unit that perpetrated one of the worst massacres in recent Latin American history, killing hundreds of old men, women and children during an operation in El Mozote and surrounding villages in December 1981. Victims’ families, acting as private prosecutors under Salvadoran law, also filed charges against senior military officials, including the former secretary of defense.
In a confidential cable to Washington, Manes wrote that she had been told that “sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate culpability of crimes against humanity and war crimes at El Mozote.” (The cable was released in response to a FOIA request from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.) The El Mozote trial “may provide a barometer for the ability of the Salvadoran justice system to tackle its complex history and stubbornly entrenched impunity,” Manes wrote.
The civil war in El Salvador was bloody, dirty and long. More than 75,000 Salvadorans were killed — peasants, students, old men, women, children — with more than 80 percent of those deaths coming at the hands of the army, its paramilitaries and death squads, according to a United Nations-backed truth commission. An archbishop was assassinated; three American nuns and a lay missionary were raped and murdered; four Dutch journalists were executed in a targeted ambush; six Jesuit priests, their cook and her 6-year-old daughter were shot at point-blank range by soldiers from an American-trained battalion. During the war, the Salvadoran army, backed by the United States, raped, pillaged, plundered and killed with impunity. No officers, and only a handful of enlisted men, were prosecuted.
At the time of the El Mozote massacre — which was first reported by journalists for The New York Times and The Washington Post — the American ambassador in El Salvador, Deane Hinton, sent a cable to Washington saying there was no evidence to confirm that civilians had been systematically killed and playing down the gravity of the killings. Elliott Abrams, then the assistant secretary of state for human rights, and who was recently named by President Donald Trump as his special envoy for Venezuela, dismissed reports of the massacre as Communist propaganda. (In 1982, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Abrams called El Mozote an incident which is at least being significantly misused, at the very best, by the guerrillas.”)

The search for justice by the families of the massacre victims has been arduous. In 1991, at the request of the archbishop’s legal aid office, a court began taking statements from witnesses, and it allowed a team of forensic anthropologists from Argentina to begin exhumations.
The exhumation of the convent behind the church in El Mozote was the most harrowing. Two weeks before Christmas in 1981, soldiers first separated the village’s men, hauled them off, and tortured and executed them. They then herded the women and children into the convent. Using American-supplied M16 assault rifles, they opened fire; then they burned the building, the falling beams crushing the skulls of those who weren’t already dead. A decade later, after painstakingly clearing away the grass and dirt that had overgrown the site, the Argentine team found the bones of 136 children and adolescents. Some were barely old enough to crawl. Average age: 6. The women were between 21 and 40. One was in her third trimester of pregnancy.
But the amnesty protections became law in 1993, and they withstood an initial challenge in the country’s Supreme Court. Human rights advocates turned to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. There was no dispute as to the facts, the court eventually held in a 152-page opinion. As part of a counterinsurgency scorched-earth policy, “the Armed Forces executed all of those persons it came across: elderly adults, men, women, boys and girls, they killed animals, destroy and burned plantations, homes, and devastated everything community-related.”
The court also found that the amnesty violated international law. In a second hearing before the Salvadoran Supreme Court, advocates pressed that argument and persuaded the judges to declare the amnesty unconstitutional.
Today, some of the main supporters of the latest possible amnesty legislation have resumes tainted by accusations of human rights abuses during the war. The principal sponsor, Rodolfo Parker, secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party, was accused by a United Nations truth commission of seeking to cover up the responsibility of senior military officers in the murder of the Jesuit priests.
Parker, who was never prosecuted, has called the claims against him false.
Political parties supporting amnesty have enough votes in the assembly to pass the law, according to an analysis by El Faro, an online news organization, which first published a draft of the proposed law.
Nelson Rauda contributed reporting from El Salvador.

Texto completo: Headnote To Be Equal
(TriceEdneyWire.com) - I have probable cause to believe that the defendants conspired with others known and unknown: (1) to bribe college entrance exam administrators to facilitate cheating on college entrance exams; (2) to bribe varsity coaches and administrators at elite universities to designate certain applicants as recruited athletes or as other favored candidates, thereby facilitating the applicants' admission to those universities; and (3) to use the facade of a charitable organization to conceal the nature and source of the bribe payments. - FBI College Admissions Bribery Scheme Affidavit
In a few weeks, the National Urban League will release report cards on states' plans to address inequity in their education system - plans they are required to submit to the federal government under the Every Child Succeeds Act.
The task is daunting, as inequities are stark, everywhere in the United States.
That's why the nation was outraged by the news that wealthy parents - whose children already have inconceivable advantages over low-income families - allegedly resorted to outright bribery and fraud to get their children into elite colleges.
More than 50 people, including two Hollywood actresses, were charged on allegations that ranged from included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to claim falsely that certain students were athletic recruits.
That money plays a big role in elite college admissions has been no secret. A donation of $500,000 or more can equal 500 points on the SAT, according to journalist Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges - and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates.
Given the outrageous advantage wealthy families already legally have, the cheating scandal throws new light on the disparity of opportunity for low-income students and children of color. Disadvantaged students and their families who are striving with all their might and resources to overcome systemic challenges viewed the scandal with particular despair.
"Just knowing that due to circumstances outside of school, you do give your best in all that you can, but you also have to kind of balance being an adult," High school senior Khi-ana Jackson of Kansas City told The New York Times. "To know that these parents are throwing money at all of these people and being like, 'Can you do this for my child,' it's kind of discouraging. Some of us will probably have to work our whole lifetime to see money like this."
African American students have far less access to college preparatory courses. According to the United Negro College Fund, only 57 percent of Black students have access to a full range of math and science courses necessary for college readiness, compared to with 81 percent of Asian American students and 71 percent of White students.
When Black students do attend schools that offer honors or advanced placement courses, they are vastly underrepresented. Black and Latino students comprise 38 percent of students in such schools, but only 29 percent of students enrolled in at least one AP course.
African American students are often located in schools with less qualified teachers, teachers with lower salaries and novice teachers, according to UNCF.
Black students are twice as likely to have their education disrupted by suspension, nearly four times as likely to receive out-of-school suspensions, and more than twice as likely to be referred to law enforcement or subjected to a school-related arrest.
Students of color are much more likely to attend schools where three-quarters of the students or more are poor or low-income, and poor districts with a higher proportion of students of color have been shown to receive substantially less state funding than comparably poor districts that have more white students.
Anyone convicted of engaging in criminal activity to bypass an already-rigged college admissions process should be punished to the full-extent of the law. But more importantly, we need to address a system riddled with bias and inequality.

Texto completo: Mississippi is on the precipice of banning abortions within six weeks of a pregnancy.
The Senate agreed with changes made by the House Tuesday, paving the way for Gov. Phil Bryant to sign it into law.
The bill does not make exceptions for instances of rape or incest. It does make an exception for cases of medical emergencies.
Bryant tweeted Tuesday afternoon that he would sign the bill, which bans abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected.
"I look forward to signing it very soon," Bryant said.
The bill also includes criminal punishments for doctors who defy the ban.
Upon becoming law, it will almost certainly spend months or years held up in litigation.
Kentucky's governor signed a similar bill into law Friday, the New York Times reported, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it just hours later.
Mississippi Legislators already approved one of the strictest abortion laws last year, banning them after 15 weeks. That law was quickly halted and found to "unequivocally" violate women's constitutional rights by a federal judge last year. Attorney General Jim Hood has vowed to fight the decision.
After the bill's passage, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves issued a statement, saying that Mississippians "value the sanctity of life."
"A beating heart clearly means life has begun and should be protected. I appreciate the work of both senators and representatives for getting this legislation to Gov. Bryant's desk," Reeves said.
The bill provoked heated debate in both chambers.
Some opponents made a financial argument, saying Mississippi will waste taxpayer money fighting an abortion ban that will never be ruled constitutional by the courts.
Sen. Derrick Simmons claimed Mississippi spent $1.2 million litigating the 15-week abortion ban.
According to Margaret Ann Morgan, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, the 15-week abortion ban has not cost the state any additional money because staff attorneys have been working on the case.
Morgan said staff attorneys have spent 916 hours on the case so far. Morgan said that time is valued at $65 hour, meaning the attorney general's office has spent nearly $60,000 on the case.
A Democratic lawmaker accused Republicans last week of grandstanding on a bill that will surely be tied up in court. Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Raymond, said Republicans were not "brave enough" to ban abortion outright.
However, some believe Mississippi will ultimately prevail in court.
During an earlier discussion of the bill, Sen. Joey Fillingane said that with the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court could rule differently on abortion than it traditionally has.
"These decisions may swing in a very different decision now," Fillingane told his fellow lawmakers.
Other states also appear to be taking note of the new Supreme Court — and how it may rule on abortion.
States like Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, Missouri and Tennessee are considering or have passed legislation similar to what could soon be law in Mississippi.
Supporters of these abortion bans foresee the possibility that the high court might either reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion, or uphold specific state laws that would undermine Roe.

Texto completo: Homeless champion
An 8-year-old boy's victory as New York state chess champion will be his family's ticket out of a homeless shelter.
The New York Times reported that Tani Adewumi won the state chess title for his age group this month even though he learned to play only about a year ago.
Tani and his family have lived in a New York City shelter since fleeing Nigeria in 2017. The Christian family feared attacks by the militant group Boko Haram.
Tani's chess coach, Russell Makofsky, set up a GoFundMe account for the family after Tani won the championship.
Makofsky joined Tani on NBC's “Today” show Tuesday and said that thanks to donations, the family is moving into an apartment.

Texto completo: Vincent Zurzolo-one of the world's leading authorities on vintage comic books-will be attending the pop culture extravaganza C2E2, March 22-24 at McCormick Place. He'll be bringing some extremely rare, valuable comic books with him. If you'd like to view these rarities and speak to a knowledgeable insider regarding the high-stakes world of collectible comics, no one tells it better or more colorfully than Vincent.
Vincent will be showcasing a copy of Action Comics #1, the most treasured book in the genre's history. The 1938 comic marked the first appearance of Superman-the world's original superhero-and because there are fewer than 100 known copies, it's extremely valuable. (Vincent's company, Metropolis Collectibles, holds four Guinness World Records related to million-dollar sales of Action #1, also known as "the holy grail of comics.") In addition, Vincent will be displaying a 9.2 CGC-rated Amazing Fantasy #15, the most valuable book of the Silver Age (1956-1970). The book marks Spider-Man's first appearance-and its value continues to climb with the superhero's popularity. Considering Spider-Man's beloved creator, Stan Lee's recent passing, this comic will be timely and interesting to fans of the comics and movies.
Vincent can tell you why that is. He can also tell you what's trending in the comic book world, what makes the best investments right now and more. Vincent is not only an expert on comic book lore and values, he's a fascinating speaker. He has appeared on episodes of Hollywood Treasures, Hidden Treasures and Strange Inheritance and has been interviewed by USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, among others.
Metropolis Collectibles-the world's largest vintage comic book dealership-will be in Booth 1319 at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo (C2E2) at McCormick Place.

Texto completo: Starting at The Denver Post before a decade at The New York Times, Alex Berenson left journalism to launch his fiction career, bursting onto the scene with “The Faithful Spy.” Inspired by his war correspondence, his first mystery thriller was a bestseller.
He continued with a popular series. “Honestly, I was getting paid very well to write those books,” he says from his Hudson Valley, N.Y., home. “It’s funny when people accuse me of doing this for the money. I get paid a lot more to write fiction than to write nonfiction.
“But this is something I feel I need to do. That’s why I’m doing it.”
By “this,” Berenson means his deep dive back into nonfiction. As for accusations, he has faced many since January’s release of “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.”
The Nation and Rolling Stone called the book “fear-mongering” and “trolling,” respectively. Vox wrote it off as “an exercise in cherry-picking data and presenting correlation as causation.” But The Marshall Project, the nonpartisan investigative reporting center, deemed it “an intensively researched and passionate dissent from the now prevailing view that marijuana is relatively harmless.”
Berenson also was blasted in an open letter by 75 scholars and clinicians for “irresponsibly and dangerously claim(ing) a causal link between marijuana use and increases in rates of psychosis and schizophrenia.”
Which is all disappointing to Berenson, who will state his case in Colorado Springs and Denver this week during talks sponsored by The Gazette, Colorado Politics and Children’s Hospital Colorado.
IF YOU GO
Alex Berenson will be in Colorado Springs and Denver this week to talk about his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence."
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at Springs' Warehouse Restaurant, 25 West Cimarron St.
• 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, 2201 East Dry Creek Road, free and open to public
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. Wednesday in Denver at the History Colorado Center at 1200 North Broadway
The opioid epidemic has come in the profiting wake of companies such as Purdue Pharma, “and now a for-profit community has sprung up for the use of” marijuana, Berenson says. Fellow journalists should be asking harder questions, he says. “It’s crazy to me that that hasn’t happened.”
He expected the criticism but not the personal attacks — the suggestions to get his kids high and the harassing calls to his wife, a forensic psychiatrist. It was her repeated mentions of marijuana in violent cases that made Berenson curious in the first place. He previously considered himself “a libertarian” on pot, having smoked “a handful of times in college and after,” he says. “I didn’t particularly care about it one way or another.”
He expected controversy before he even typed the prologue, which establishes the book as an argument and, in his words, “not balanced.” Berenson’s stance is further announced by the title, a nod to “Reefer Madness.” (The early propaganda film originally was called “Tell Your Children.”)
Yes, Berenson knew users wouldn’t appreciate his book.
“People have a really strange attachment to this drug,” he says. “I think most people who use alcohol, if they’re using it every day and certainly if they’re using it all day every day, they’re going to acknowledge, you know what, maybe I have a little problem with this.
“And by the way, if you’re using cocaine or heroine or methamphetamine like that, you’re not even gonna tell people. But cannabis people are proud to tell you they wake and bake.”
Berenson, a 1994 Yale graduate, cites a 2017 study by the National Academy of Medicine that said “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk.” In a New Yorker piece stirred by Berenson’s findings and titled “Is Marijuana as Safe as We Think?”, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that the committee’s statement was “one of its few unequivocal conclusions.”
But committee member Ziva Cooper took to Twitter in January to say “we did NOT conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia.” She wrote that since the report, “we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use” and that cannabidiol “improves outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.”
Berenson has stood by his reporting. After his wife switched the light bulb in 2016, he went to London to meet with concerned psychiatrists at King’s College, among scientists around the world he interviewed. He pulled records from several states and nations. He came to the Colorado prison holding Richard Kirk to talk at length with the man who blamed a marijuana edible for shooting and killing his wife in 2014.
Berenson says he could have reported longer. “But my feeling was, I don’t need to do that, I don’t need to reinvent the wheel here, because science is really clear. And this is a really important issue for public health ... It’s more important that I get it out.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O'Rourke's presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn't accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O'Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O'Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he "brought a great deal of vitality" to his work "preserving our planet and protecting our people." (In fact, O'Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, "What would you say is Beto O'Rourke's top accomplishment that he brings to the table?" Hinojosa could not name a single one. "I'm not even talking about Congress," Henry said. "What has he done in his life?" "Your question is meaningless," Hinojosa replied.
So, if O'Rourke hasn't accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that "unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O'Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country's toxic politics." The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair's Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O'Rourke "can't deny the pull of his own gifts." He tells a reporter, "Man, I'm just born to be in it."
He's not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union — a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. "I think that I am a skilled communicator," she said. "I think I'm a very good thinker. No, I know I'm a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience."
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as "former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations" (a temporary membership for young people) as well as "a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations." That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O'Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That's true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O'Rourke, he had actual accomplishments — including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O'Rourke's chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders's first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, "In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007."
Apparently, Democrats like losers. We'll soon see if one can win the presidency.

That green jacket fits so well, Reed will try hard to keep it

Texto completo: The guest list is exclusive, though entirely predictable. To get in, you have to own a green jacket.
The green jacket.
Defending Masters champion Patrick Reed has always known who will be at the Champions dinner he gets to host next month at Augusta National, from the Golden Bear Jack Nicklaus to the likes of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Sergio Garcia and every other Masters winner before him. But to listen to Reed talk in recent weeks about his imminent return to the beautiful Georgia golf course he tamed so memorably a year ago is to understand that he's also known for a long time what he would put on the menu, having dreamt it up as a young kid pretending every big putt he made was on Augusta's 18th green.
The 28-year-old American officially took the suspense out of his meal months ago, revealing during a tournament at Kapalua that he and fellow former champions will be dining on bone-in ribeye, macaroni and cheese, creamed spinach, and creamed corn. Pretty traditional fare for one of golf's least conventional stars, a menu it seems will please all diners (he promised to include some lighter, healthier options as well) no matter how they might feel about their host.
Yet as much as Reed has established a decidedly iconoclastic profile in a game full of individuals, somehow coming across as more of a loner than nearly everyone else on tour, his reflection on a year as Masters champ had him sounding more like the 13-year-old boy who'd long ago dreamed up that menu than any bad boy of the current game.
“I honestly can't wait for the week to start," he said in a conference call with reporters Monday.
He's been plenty busy across the last 12 months. The biggest headlines came when he took on the golf establishment, an epic post-Ryder Cup rant to the New York Times in which he ripped both teammates and captain Jim Furyk for pairings that were tailored to players' friendship desires over competitive advantage, decisions Reed believes led to the US loss and only further burnished his reputation as an outsider in the game.
But the most fun came in the times he got to travel round the world in that signature green jacket, from his first moments in it back at Butler Cabin this time last year, to a memorable courtside exchange at the world's most famous arena.
Asked his favorite memory in the jacket, Reed told a story about his young daughter.
“It would have had to have been right after we won and right after I got done talking in the press conference, right after we finished," he said. “I went back to Butler Cabin, and my daughter was there, and she just came over and gave me a big hug and told me I did it and told me she loved me. That is by far the best experience I've ever had with the green jacket. That's a memory and a moment that I'll never forget, no matter if I were to win multiple other green jackets, any other tournament I were to win, or anything like that. It's going to be hard to be able to top a moment like that that I was able to cherish with the little one."
Asked for his most interesting memory in the jacket, Reed told a story about attending a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.
“It was on a Monday night, [my wife] Justine and I were at the Knicks game and were sitting courtside for the first time. I had Chris Rock right next to us. A couple seats down is 2 Chainz. He just kind of keeps looking down, and you can tell he's kind of looking down like, 'All right, this isn't the normal guy that sits in these seats; who is that?' And then when they announced me during one of the timeouts, then a couple minutes later there was a timeout and he just kind of reaches over, and he kind of touches the jacket, and he goes, 'So that's the real thing, huh?' I'm like, 'Yes, sir, yes, it is.' It's pretty cool to see just kind of the wide variety of people no matter what their background is, no matter what their age is or anything, how many people recognize the green jacket.
“You have little kids coming up to me whenever I wear it out, and they're just like, 'Oh, it's the green jacket.' Some of them play golf, some of them don't, and I just think it's such a cool thing how many people recognize what the green jacket is and what it actually stands for."
Asked for his least favorite memory in the jacket, Reed deferred.
“It hasn't come yet," he said. “My least favorite moment is going to be when I have to return the jacket and I'm not allowed to have it in my closet and wear it around the house and out at places. It's definitely going to give me motivation to go out and try to repeat as well as try to win multiple, because even the times I'm not actually wearing the green jacket, to be able to see the green jacket sitting in your closet or sitting in an area where you're always kind of walking by and you'll see it, it just gives you motivation and kind of picks me up and tells me that you want to keep it around. You want to keep it around as long as you can. The only way you're going to do that is continue winning at Augusta and continue winning the event so you can have it year in and year out."
No word on if he's already decided on an encore Champions Dinner menu.

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG -- A high-ranking politician in South Africa's governing African National Congress was arrested in connection with the assassination of a party member who had exposed corruption in a public works project, officials said Monday.
Mluleki Ndobe, one of the most influential A.N.C. power brokers in KwaZulu-Natal Province, was arrested early Sunday for suspected involvement in the mafia-style killing of a nationally known party leader, Sindiso Magaqa, according to party and police officials.
Mr. Magaqa, who had loudly condemned the theft of public money in the town of Umzimkhulu, was fatally shot inside his Mercedes-Benz in 2017 by two hit men who sprayed the car with gunfire. A man suspected of being one of the killers was arrested in September.
The assassination -- the most high-profile in a wave of political killings that have swept across South Africa since early 2016 -- came to symbolize the decline of the A.N.C., whose members have increasingly targeted anticorruption whistle-blowers and turned on one another in lethal fights over political posts.
The police also arrested Zweliphansi Skhosana, the municipal manager of Umzimkhulu, according to party officials. Mr. Skhosana was considered the leader in town of an A.N.C. faction that was led by Mr. Ndobe at the district level.
The two men are expected to appear in court on Tuesday. It was not clear on Monday what charges they would face or whether either had a lawyer.
In an interview last year, Mr. Skhosana denied the allegations of corruption in the town and accused Mr. Magaqa of making up stories to further his political ambitions.
Separately, Mr. Ndobe, the district mayor, told The New York Times that infighting inside the A.N.C. was worse than the struggle against apartheid. "It was better before we attained democracy, because we knew the enemy -- that the enemy was the regime, the unjust regime," he said. "Now, you don't know who is the enemy."
Given the political sensitivities of the recent killings inside the A.N.C., few cases have led to arrests, and even fewer to convictions. The government of President Cyril Ramaphosa, criticized by human rights groups and even A.N.C. officials for doing little to crack down on the killings, had come under increasing pressure to make progress on the investigation of Mr. Magaqa's death.
Reflecting the party divisions, allies of each of the men involved reacted with astonishment, relief or dismay according to their allegiances.
"We are surprised," said Mphuthumi Mpabanga, Umzimkhulu's mayor and an ally of Mr. Skhosana, on Monday morning. "This is bad news."
"I'm feeling better now that the law still applies," Jabulile Msiya, a political ally of Mr. Magaqa's who was inside his car during the shooting, said Monday. "We'd like to see justice happening in our town in Umzimkhulu."
Mr. Magaqa began receiving death threats in early 2017 after he accused fellow A.N.C. members of siphoning money in the multimillion-dollar renovation of a community hall. Two of his political allies, who had supported his call for an official investigation, were killed by hit men in their homes.
Then in July 2017, hit men in a red BMW attacked Mr. Magaqa in his car.
Because of the stature Mr. Ndobe and Mr. Skhosana held within the A.N.C., some experts said that the authorities had shown little appetite to pursue an investigation into Mr. Magaqa's killing. His mother and other relatives said that A.N.C. provincial and national leaders -- after initially expressing support and attending Mr. Magaqa's funeral -- had not joined the family in pushing for an inquiry.
Mary de Haas, an expert on political killings who lectured at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said it was unclear why the arrests had occurred so long after the killing.
"Evidence has been sitting there since the attack on Magaqa," Ms. de Haas said.
Thabiso Zulu, an A.N.C. member and whistle-blower who helped Mr. Magaqa expose corruption in Umzimkhulu, said he and others had provided the authorities with evidence in the case long ago.
"All we can say is that the A.N.C. is going into an election soon, and they're running on a ticket of clean government and anticorruption, so something had to give," Mr. Zulu said on Monday, referring to national elections scheduled for May 8.
For nearly a year, Mr. Zulu and Les Stuta, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who helped Mr. Magaqa, have lived in hiding because of constant death threats.
President Ramaphosa's government has resisted a recommendation by the Office of the Public Protector, a government agency that investigates corruption, to provide police protection for Mr. Zulu and Mr. Stuta. Mr. Ramaphosa's police minister has gone to court to challenge the Public Protector's recommendation, and Mr. Ramaphosa is waiting to see the legal outcome, his office has said.
In December, the Public Protector released a report calling on the police to investigate the killings of Mr. Magaqa and others in Umzimkhulu.
And in February, the public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, stepped up the pressure on Mr. Ramaphosa, singling out the president and his police minister for failing to carry out her recommendation as required by law. "You should be respecting the Constitution and the rule of law," Ms. Mkhwebane told the police minister.
Mr. Stuta, one of the two whistle-blowers, said Monday that he still feared for his life despite the arrests. Allies of the two arrested men were still out there, he said.
"Hit men are still all over the show," he said.

FOX News hires Donna Brazile
NEW YORK | Former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile, who was fired by CNN for tipping off the Hillary Clinton campaign about debate topics in 2016, has joined FOX News Channel as a political commentator.
Brazile said Monday she knows fellow liberals will criticize her for joining Fox, but that it’s important for people not to retreat to “safe spaces” where they just talk to people who agree with them.
Library opens archive dedicated to rocker Lou Reed
NEW YORK | The New York Public Library has opened an archive dedicated to pioneering alternative rock musician Lou Reed.
The library acquired the archive after performance artist and musician Laurie Anderson, who was married to Reed, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase the archive. The New York Times reported the archive includes a large collection of personal notes, photographs and more than 600 hours of recordings.
Anderson says Reed never discussed what to do with his belongings before his death in 2013. She says she thought the archive should be accessible to young musicians and anyone interested in his life.
Reed was the lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter for The Velvet Underground, and had a solo career that spanned decades after leaving the band.

Resumen: Federal authorities raided the office of Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy last summer, seeking records related to his dealings with foreign officials and Trump administration associates, according to a sealed search warrant obtained by ProPublica. The search warrant cites three potential crimes that authorities are investigating: conspiracy, money laundering and violations of the law barring covert lobbying on behalf of foreign officials. According to the warrant, federal authorities also sought to seize any records related to China and Guo Wengui, a Chinese businessman and dissident who fled to New York, where he publicly accused the Chinese government of corruption.

Federal authorities raided the office of Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy last summer, seeking records related to his dealings with foreign officials and Trump administration associates, according to a sealed search warrant obtained by ProPublica.
Agents were authorized to use the megadonor’s hands and face to unlock any phones that required fingerprint or facial scans.
The Washington Post reported in August that the Justice Department was investigating Broidy. The sealed warrant offers new details of federal authorities’ investigation of allegations that Broidy had attempted to cash in on his Trump White House connections in dealings with foreign officials. It also shows that the government took a more aggressive approach with the Trump ally than was previously known, entering his office and removing records — just as it did with Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen.
Broidy served as a major Trump campaign fundraiser and was the national deputy finance chair of the Republican National Committee until he resigned in April 2018, when it was revealed he had agreed to secretly pay off a former Playboy model in exchange for her silence about their affair.
The search warrant cites three potential crimes that authorities are investigating: conspiracy, money laundering and violations of the law barring covert lobbying on behalf of foreign officials. To obtain a search warrant, authorities have to convince a judge that there’s a probable cause they will find evidence of those specific crimes.
The search warrant also for the first time links Broidy to a globe-trotting Miami Beach party promoter.
The warrant, filed in July 2018, targeted Broidy’s office in Los Angeles. The scope of what authorities were seeking was broad. They planned to seize any evidence related to a list of dozens of people, countries and corporate entities, according to the warrant. Among the names on the list are Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign official who has pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe; Colfax Law Office, the firm founded by Robin Rosenzweig, Broidy’s wife; and several foreign countries.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment for this story.
Broidy’s attorney as well as a spokesman did not answer a list of detailed questions sent by ProPublica.
Broidy, an investor based in Los Angeles, pleaded guilty in 2009 to charges connected to his role in a major New York state public corruption and bribery case. But after backing Trump for president, he saw his star rise again. After the inauguration, he played a central role in filling administration vacancies, according to reports by ProPublica and others.
However, he once again quickly became mired in controversy, amid allegations of influence peddling and his dealings with the former Playboy model.
The search warrant shows that federal authorities are interested in Broidy’s alleged work for the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who is at the center of a sprawling international scandal known as 1MDB. In November, the Justice Department unveiled a bribery and money laundering case against Low.
In a separate filing in November, the Justice Department alleged that Broidy was paid by Low to lobby Trump administration officials to ease off on U.S. investigations into Low. Broidy is not identified by name in the filings, but he is widely reported to be the person referred to as “Individual No. 1.” Broidy has not been charged with a crime, and it’s unclear what the status of the investigation is.
Pras Michel, a member of the hip-hop group The Fugees and an associate of Low’s, funnelled the money to pay Broidy into the United States, the Justice Department alleged. Asked about the Broidy search warrant, a lawyer for Michel, Barry Pollack, said: “There has been news of this Broidy investigation for many months. Mr. Michel has not been charged with any wrongdoing whatsoever related to Mr. Broidy or anyone else.”
Federal authorities were also seeking records in Broidy’s office related to the United Arab Emirates, UAE adviser George Nader, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and any travel to the Middle East.

Sessions Turned to Convicted Fundraiser for Advice on U.S. Attorneys
Preparing to restock the Department of Justice at the start of the Trump administration, Jeff Sessions sought out Elliott Broidy for recommendations. The Republican donor’s conviction in a political corruption case years earlier didn’t seem to be a problem.
Elliott Broidy’s All-Access Pass — “Trump, Inc.” Podcast
Our podcast investigation is back — and this time we’re looking at more than just the president’s family.
The New York Times reported last year that Broidy worked with Nader to steer the White House toward decisions benefiting the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Documents reviewed by the Times showed that Nader tempted Broidy with the prospect of more than $1 billion in contracts for Broidy’s private security company. Hacked communications showed Nader praised Broidy for “how well you handle Chairman” — a reference to Trump.
Nader became a cooperating witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian influence in the 2016 election, according to multiple news reports.
Broidy’s attorney has in the past responded to the allegations with a statement saying Broidy “has never agreed to work for, been retained by nor been compensated by any foreign government for any interaction with the United States Government, ever. Any implication to the contrary is a lie.”
According to the warrant, federal authorities also sought to seize any records related to China and Guo Wengui, a Chinese businessman and dissident who fled to New York, where he publicly accused the Chinese government of corruption.
The Times reported that Broidy explored plans to use his influence with the White House to force Guo out of the United States, apparently as part of an effort to curry favor with the Chinese and other foreign officials, and ultimately earn a payoff.
The search warrant for Broidy’s office also lists a name and corporation not previously linked to Broidy: “Joel Rouseau” and “Intelligent Resources.” There is a company by that name incorporated in Miami Beach by a Joel Rousseau, who is a friend of Michel’s. The search warrant does not describe Rousseau or Intelligent Resources’ role in the case.
Rousseau’s Instagram account shows him bouncing from Rio to Paris to Ibiza, frequently surrounded by models. “If you want to be successful, you need the beautiful people,” he told Crain’s New York in 2007, which described him as a specialist “in bringing agency models to clubs.” In another series of pictures, he is at an oil site in Haiti with workers he describes as his drilling crew. Rousseau made a foray into politics in 2012 when he donated tens of thousands of dollars to several Democratic Party groups.
Filings in a court case over unpaid taxes describe Rousseau as an “entrepreneur” with income swinging from under $1,000 for 2009 to over $2 million in 2013. He paid a long-standing bill for back taxes and penalties of more than $700,000 in late 2017, the filings show.
The address for Intelligent Resources is a house on Miami Beach’s exclusive Hibiscus Island. The person answering the door at the house last week told a reporter he had rented the house on Airbnb. Rousseau didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Meghan McCain slams Trump on 'The View' after he attacked John McCain on Twitter

Texto completo: The daughter of John McCain fired back at President Trump after he tweeted disparaging comments about the late senator this weekend.
In tweets on Saturday and Sunday, Trump attacked McCain — who died in August 2018 after battling brain cancer — over his role in the Russia investigation, and disparaged the senator for his decisive thumbs-down vote that doomed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He also mocked McCain's academic record (the senator, himself, never shied from noting that he graduated fifth from the bottom at the Naval Academy).
Trump had appeared to be quoting a Fox News interview at the time, referring to the so-called Steele Dossier. (In fact, McCain provided a copy of the dossier to the FBI after Election Day, according to the New York Times.)
The president's comments about McCain, however, did not go unchecked. Meghan McCain stepped up to defend her father, tweeting to Trump: “No one will ever love you the way they loved my father."
Many people tweeted in support of the McCains. Trump, however, responded by retweeting one of his supporters, who hit back at Meghan.
McCain, who is also a co-host on ABC's “The View," elaborated on her tweet during the show on Monday.
“He spends his weekends obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it, he will never be a great man," McCain said of Trump, as the audience clapped. “My father was his kryptonite in life, he's his kryptonite in death."
McCain said her father spent his free time with his family — “cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life" — which led her to think more about Trump.
“I just thought, 'Your life is spent on your weekends not with your family, not with your friends, but obsessing — obsessing — over great men you could never live up to."'
The bad blood between Trump and McCain goes back to when Trump was campaigning in 2015, in which he said McCain was a war hero “because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured." The feud seemed to escalate from there, as McCain withdrew his endorsement of Trump following the "Access Hollywood" tape, and then cast a “no" vote on the Affordable Care Act repeal measure.
RELATED: A look back at the long-running feud between John McCain and Donald Trump
In August, as McCain battled brain cancer, Trump signed a $716 billion defense policy bill named for the Arizona Republican — but included no mention of him in his remarks.
Before he died, McCain made it clear that Trump was not welcome at his memorial service in Washington, even as both President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in the 2008 presidential race, and President George W. Bush, who defeated him in the Republican primaries in 2000, delivered eulogies.

Where Does Government Draw the Line?

Texto completo: Hi. I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news.
You say antitrust. I say: How much?
There is little as fashionable in 2019 as the desire to curb Big Tech's power. But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valley's largest companies isn't straightforward.
At one extreme, there are calls to break up Big Tech. Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, argued that companies shouldn't offer their own products on platforms they controlled (like Apple's selling apps on its App Store -- something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday). She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions, such as Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp.
Her pitch isn't perfect, as The New York Times's Kevin Roose pointed out -- it's too generic, misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues. But it is a bold, inspiring rally cry for Big Tech's biggest critics.
At the other end of the spectrum: tech companies. Ideally, the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly. But even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, acknowledged that it was "inevitable that there will be some regulation" when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in April.
There's plenty of room between those extremes. Take, for example, a report published Wednesday by the British government, which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech. Its main proposal: that a new regulator identify companies with "strategic market status," then block some activities -- such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors (hello, Google!).
That, the report's authors say, is a "more pro-business and pro-consumer solution" than "changing antitrust law to drive breakup" of businesses.
So who's right? Mr. Zuckerberg, at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable. There's strong bipartisan support for such regulation. As for where a line should be drawn, that's harder to say.
Breaking up big companies isn't easy: It's expensive and takes a long time. And it doesn't always go to plan. The last notable attempt to do so, when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law, was overturned on appeal. So Ms. Warren could have her work cut out for her.
But it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need. Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies, or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior? That's something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle with.
Trading off trust for profit to build A.I.
When OpenAI was founded three years ago, it had a huge goal: to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain. Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions -- it had $1 billion in funding from backers to pay its way -- the public could trust it to build that so-called general artificial intelligence.
Only, $1 billion doesn't go far with goals like that. Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash. Actually, it turns out, some profits might be useful.
So, Wired reported, Open AI announced that it was changing its business model. To keep up with Facebook and Google, it created a OpenAI L.P., a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit, like venture funds. That will make it easier to raise funds. Down the line, it might monetize some of the technology it develops. But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see -- to $100 for every dollar invested.
One way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a 100-times return to be an ethical margin on building a general A.I. -- enough to make it a feasible endeavor, but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush. That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley. But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at ease.
What the web could look like in 30 years
On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss, Mike Sendall, called "vague but exciting." It ultimately became the World Wide Web, and 30 years later we're left with much to love -- and hate -- about its existence.
At an event at London's Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the web's passage into its fourth decade, Mr. Berners-Lee was asked what it might look like in another 30 years. Here's what he said:
■ "It's not, I think, for us to try and guess."
■ "Look at what's happened over the last 30 years. The web has changed really dramatically, and a lot of that we couldn't have predicted."
■ "What we can do is we can say what web we want."
■ "We want a web which is open. We want a web which is royalty-free. We want a web which is discrimination-free."
Worthy goals. And in an article he wrote this past week, Mr. Berners-Lee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen:
■ "Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open."
■ "Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety."
■ "Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. "
■ "And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable."
Thirty years on, Mr. Sendall's analysis might apply equally well to this proposal, too.
And some stories you shouldn't miss
Elon Musk really dislikes whistle-blowers. According to Businessweek, Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the company.
How does Google pay off executives accused of misconduct? Handsomely: Two shared a total of $135 million, according to details that emerged from a lawsuit during the week.
Who will fund the next wave of tech start-ups? That'll be the millionaires who are created when companies like Airbnb and Uber go public.
You should care about TikTok. You might never use it, but it could reshape social media as you know it.
Scientists dropped a smartphone into a blender. Because that, apparently, is the best way to work out how much cobalt, gold and other substances are in there.
How to disappear (almost) completely: A Bitcoin evangelist offered 15 steps to going dark while staying online.
Silicon Valley wants to build a monument. To Silicon Valley, obviously.

Texto completo: Floodwater rises in Midwest
Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a deluge of rainwater and snowmelt poured over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers and killing at least one person. James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Neb., was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed. Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwestern Omaha. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota.
Missing toddler's body found in Minnesota - A child's body found wrapped in a blanket along a Minnesota highway is believed to be that of a missing 2-year-old girl whose mother police have said was fatally shot by her former pimp, authorities announced Saturday. The discovery of the child's body came hours after officials had put out a plea asking "the entire nation" to help find Noelani Robinson, whose father, Dariaz Higgins, is charged with killing her mother in Milwaukee on Monday. An off-duty public works employee found the body that's believed to be Noelani's while driving home Friday night, Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said. The body was inside a blanket off the shoulder of Minnesota Highway 218 north of Austin, about 300 miles west of Milwaukee.
Black editor resigns from newspaper that urged KKK revival - An African-American woman who took over the helm of a small-town Alabama newspaper that recently called for the Ku Klux Klan to "ride again" has stepped down after a few weeks, citing interference from the newspaper's owner. Elecia R. Dexter, 46, told The New York Times on Friday that she stepped down because of continuing interference from the newspaper's owner who had published the KKK editorial. Dexter said she wanted to maintain her "integrity and well-being."
Search continues for missing Navajo girl - A search continued Saturday along the San Juan River on the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation for a 3-year-old girl missing since late Thursday after she reportedly wandered away from her home. The Navajo Nation Police Department said in a statement on Facebook that more than 100 volunteers searched for Andanndine Jones on foot along 8 miles of the riverbed west of Aneth while boat crews from county, state and federal agencies covered 24 miles of the river.
No 'active threat' on U. of Michigan campus despite alert - The University of Michigan gave an all-clear after sending out alerts warning of an unconfirmed active shooter at a campus building on Saturday. Alerts about an "active shooter" issued by the school's Department of Public Safety and Security asked students who were near Mason Hall on the Ann Arbor campus to "run, hide, fight." The messages went out just after 5 p.m. local time on Saturday and said officers were responding on the shooting reports. About 40 minutes later, the school sent another alert saying there "does not appear to be an active threat to the community." The department asked students to continue to stay clear of the area and said they were investigating.

Texto completo: For years Pat Zietlow Miller has been writing about strength, courage and friendship through picture books that explain these complex ideas with compassionate characters like butternut squash-loving Sophie and a kindness-spreading student and her friend Tanisha.
Her latest book, "When You Are Brave," released March 5, continues in this vein. It follows Miller's 2018 New York Times bestseller "Be Kind"and is the second book she's had published this year.
Miller lives in Sun Prairie and the illustrator, Eliza Wheeler, is from Solon Springs, Wis., and now lives in Minneapolis. The book was published by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.
Q: Was this story a long time coming?
A: 'When You Are Brave' was one of the quicker picture books I've written. I was feeling a little bummed out about some of the things going on in my life. I just started writing myself a pep talk. (Once finished) I thought, 'you know, this could be a picture book.' Usually with picture books there is writing, rewriting, revisions they can take months to years to get it the way I want it ("When You Are Brave") was much more rapid. I just wasn't as worried about it. I think I was being really honest because of how I was feeling at that moment.
Q: What was your inspiration for this book?
A: When I look at myself as a kid, I was a very shy, timid kid. This is the book I would have needed as a kid (assuring me) I am braver than I think. It's about inner strength and using it to get through challenging situations.
The text of the book is pretty general, but (illustrator) Eliza Wheeler drew the pictures of a child moving from one house across the country to a new location. The book talks about situations when you might have to be brave like getting on a bus going to school jumping into the deep end. As adults, we ask children to be brave a lot but we forget for other kids these are some major things and adults may need to be a little more patient.
Q: Did you intend for Wheeler to interpret the text as a cross-country move?
A: No, that all came from the illustrator, which was great. It's almost like a whole separate story, but they work together so perfectly.
Q: Your books seem to have a wide readership age with themes that speak to adults and children alike. Is there an age that "When You Are Brave" is geared toward or do you strive for a universal appeal?
A: I really try to get the universal feel. The thing that guides me the most the core ... is a universal human emotion. So no matter if you're 4 or 94, you can say 'Oh, I've felt that way.' Hopefully that's what gives the book universal appeal, because I really think picture books really are for everybody.
Q: "Be Kind" can be found in many elementary classrooms. How do you feel about this role your book is taking? Is it your hope "When You Are Brave" will follow a similar path?
A: Almost every school I've been in the past year they have a kindness initiative. It wasn't planned the book came out and I found out how many schools were working on (kindness programs) and it really was a good fit. It's almost hard to explain that something I created with other people is being used that widely. I just find that you can't predict or plan it.
Q: You work full time as an editor for American Family Insurance Co. in Sun Prairie. When do you find time to write and what are you working on now?
A: It is really hard to balance because I'm (at American Family) full time and have one kid still at home. I am working on a sequel to 'Be Kind' called 'Be Strong' in addition to a couple different stories I hope to go out and sell. At night I'm usually at the kitchen counter on the computer. I used to have a much more structured schedule, now it's just when I have time. You just make it happen.
Q: A sequel to "Be Kind" is exciting! How was that to write?
A: Honestly, it's almost harder to write a sequel than a new, fresh thing. There were eight or nine drafts, then a lot of tweaking. It was harder than some other books. "Be Kind" did so well you want the sequel to be good.
Q: Yes, no pressure! When is it slated to be released?
A: It's not coming out until 2021. The girl in "Be Kind" (Tanisha, who in the opening page spills grape juice on her new dress) is the star of 'Be Strong.' In 'Be Strong' she is finding her power.
Q: What about "When You Are Brave" do you want people to know or notice that they might not initially?
A: If you take the dust jacket off .. there is this beautiful embossed art (on the front of the hardcover). I think some people never take the paper jacket off. (Illustrator) Eliza Wheeler came up with the idea. When I saw it I was amazed."

Colorado politico saw classmate Roger Stone as a plotter, but not the 'Prince of Darkness'| Joey Bunch

Texto completo: Chill out, parents. High school, at best, is a fortune cookie for how somebody turns out; it basically predicts a vague direction. A prime example of national proportion runs through Colorado.
My friend and mentor Dean Toda is a former New York Times and Colorado Springs Gazette editor, before he became a campaign member for Andrew Romanoff’s U.S. Senate run in 2010 and then spokesman (and much more) for the state House Democrats. He retired last year.
In high school, they called him Toad. He loved to ski and sail, and his pet peeve was horoscopes. That’s according to the profile in his yearbook for the class of 1970 at John Jay High School in Westchester County, N.Y.
Classmate Carol Tomcyk’s picture and profile separated Toad from Roger J. Stone Jr., the “chronic campaigner.” Today Stone’s the famous political dirty trickster, from Richard Nixon’s Committee to Re-elect the President to Donald Trump’s alleged connection to WikiLeaks. Stone blossomed into a tabloid-quality political star under a constant dark cloud.
In a class of about 250, Toda can really only clearly remember one direct interaction with Stone, when he sought Toda’s vote in a student council race.
“I really didn’t know him well,” Toda told me. “It was obvious back then he was a big fan of Dick Nixon, but back in 1968-’69-’70, that wasn’t unusual. This was before Watergate. Millions of people liked Dick Nixon back then.”
Stone, however, memorialized his loyalty with “NIXON’S THE ONE” in his yearbook profile.
According to a 2008 profile in The New Yorker magazine, Stone had Nixon’s smiling face tattooed on his back, just below his neck. “Women love it,” he told the writer, Jeffrey Toobin.
Style was always a thing for Stone, it appears.
“I think, even back then, he was something of a dandy,” Toda recalled. “He wore ties to school a lot, and, I’m sorry, no one wore ties to school. This was the late ’60s and 1970.”
Toda wore round glasses and participated in student government at John Jay. His hippie phase didn’t kick until he was studying philosophy at Vassar College.
Stone was all about the politics from early on. When he was 13 in 1965, he would take the train into New York City on the weekends to work on William F. Buckley’s unsuccessful mayoral campaign, Stone has told those writing about him. Before he graduated from high school, he was such a Republican activist, Stone already was advising local candidates, he said.
In a lengthy 1986 profile in the Washington Post (“The Rise and Gall of Roger Stone”), John Jay High social studies teacher John Wirchansky said, “Nobody could forget Roger Stone.”
“Politics was his life,” Wirchansky said. “When he ran for student council president, they had bunting, people coming down the aisles in hats. He put on quite a show. We never had another person like him.”
After graduation, Stone moved to Washington to start an unfinished education at George Washington University. He soon was picked to be president of the District of Columbia Young Republicans and took off like a rocket into GOP politics.
He was a player in the Watergate investigation into Dick’s dirty tricks. Stone made a campaign contribution in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance to Pete McCloskey, a California Republican congressman who ran against Nixon in 1972 on an anti-war platform.
Stone tried to leverage the dirty trick to kneecap McCloskey’s bid. Separately, Stone found an operative to spy on the Quakers who were protesting for peace outside the White House.
“Was he a schemer, was he a plotter when it came to student council politics?” Toda recalled. “Yeah, maybe he was a little bit. But let me put it this way: There was no indication that this Richard Nixon fan, out of millions of Richard Nixon fans, would turn out to be the Prince of Darkness.”
That princely nickname, by the way, is one Stone loves.
Stone, however, could be the link that ties President Donald Trump to the Democratic Party emails stolen by Russians that possibly tipped the 2016 election.
Stone faces charges from the special counsel that he was the conduit before the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.
Stone once embraced the boast during the campaign, but now denies it, with his freedom and Trump’s presidency in the balance.
But from what he knew of Stone in high school, Toda has no bad memories of the guy. Their politics certainly took them in opposite directions.
“From what I knew of him, I don’t bear any personal animus toward him,” Toda said. “I sort of loathe him for what I know of his life since we were in high school together, but based on my personal recollection of him, I don’t have anything against him.”
As far as early promise goes, neither Stone nor Toda showed as much as a senior at Fox Lane High School, about 10 miles over from their school. In May 1970, the local paper reported Susan Dey was off to Hollywood to star in a new TV show, “The Partridge Family.”
“We’re all still in a daze,” the mother of the future Laurie Partridge told the local paper, the Patent Trader.
Toad never met Susan Dey.

Don't dismiss life insurance as too pricey. Here's how to pick a plan

Texto completo: Ask someone why they’re investing for retirement, and they’ll usually give two answers: to cover post-retirement living expenses and to help provide for a spouse after they're gone.
But what if "gone" comes far earlier than you expect? Term life insurance is a great – but often misunderstood – safety net.
Term life insurance is a policy with a fixed end date – usually 10, 20 or 30 years out, depending on when you expect the kids to be out of the house and your nest egg to be sufficient. It is meant to ensure your family can cover funeral expenses, debt and other needs after you’re deceased.
I bought a term life insurance policy after my children were born, and think it’s a smart move for most families. Those wanting lifelong coverage may find permanent life insurance more beneficial.
Yet industry observers have found many folks don’t investigate life insurance options. TermLife2Go, which seeks to help consumers navigate this complex industry, found most people assume life insurance costs three times more than it really does.
Why? Insurance companies can’t provide a quote until you answer a slew of questions about your health, habits and lifestyle. It’s the verbal equivalent of a colonoscopy. Many fear filling out reams of paperwork or taking medical exams, only to find out they can’t afford the insurance. It’s a vicious cycle.
Knowing how companies price life insurance helps you cut through that fog. TermLife2Go has a great online resource showing how insurance rates boil down to six factors: age, health, type and term, desired payout, gender and lifestyle.
Age is simple: The younger you are, the cheaper your coverage. Rates start jumping once you hit 40 and rise as you age, with availability more limited the older you get.
Health is the biggest swing factor. Nonsmokers pay less than smokers. Duh! Good family medical histories and healthy body types help, too. The more health issues you have, the more you’ll pay. Major illness in your family history can also raise costs.
The type and term of plan you want is something you can control. Term life is generally cheaper than permanent policies – less risk for the insurer. A whole life policy – good until you die, as long as you pay the premiums – costs more. These permanent policies build cash value – excess premium that accumulates within the policy. Folks say they’re like savings accounts. Some policies even offer investment options for the cash value. But added costs often make these unattractive.
My advice: You’re usually better off buying cheaper term insurance and plugging the savings into your 401(k). But it’s a personal choice.
Payout is also within your control and simple: The bigger the payout, the bigger the premium.
As for gender, ladies have it easier. Because a woman has a longer life expectancy than a man, her premium is typically lower. The gap isn’t huge, but it is noteworthy.
Finally, lifestyle, is a potpourri. It includes occupation, hobbies, how much you drive and travel (and the relative danger of countries you visit frequently). Folks with high-risk jobs like loggers and roofers pay higher premiums than office workers. So will those with risky hobbies, including motorcycle riding, wilderness backpacking, rock climbing and boating. If you spend too much time swimming with sharks – or boating in high-risk places – premiums get pricey. Couch potatoes typically pay higher rates than active and athletic folks.
Again, whether and what type of life insurance is right for you depends on you and your family’s needs. What I hope you do now is investigate.

Texto completo: Vermont state trooper revived after apparent drug exposure
LEICESTER, Vt. -- A Vermont State Police trooper who collapsed after apparently being exposed to an opioid-like drug during a traffic stop was revived by fellow troopers who administered the overdose-reversal drug Narcan, state police said Saturday.
Detectives are launching an investigation into the incident and testing is underway to determine what substance made acting Sgt. Brett Flansburg ill.
"Now there is a new threat that we're seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts," Col. Matthew Birmingham, the head of the state police, said Saturday.
Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country in which police officers overdose after accidentally coming into contact with opioid-based drugs.
Flansburg stopped a vehicle late Friday night for a traffic violation in Leicester, about 40 miles south of Burlington. Flansburg later observed a passenger swallow a small bag he later said contained cocaine.
In searching the car, Flansburg collected as evidence a small quantity of heroin in a baggie, an empty plastic baggie and a syringe. The passenger, who was checked out by doctors, but needed no medical care, was taken into custody by other troopers and later charged with heroin possession.
While transporting evidence, Flansburg collapsed in the parking lot of the barracks. Troopers administered two doses of Narcan. He received a third dose on the way to the hospital.
Flansburg responded and was released from the hospital after receiving additional treatment.

Lawyer: U.S. Navy veteran held in Iran sentenced to 10 years
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A U.S. Navy veteran from California has been sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran, his lawyer said Saturday, becoming the first American known to be imprisoned there since President Donald Trump took office.
Though the case against Michael R. White remains unclear, it comes as Trump has taken a hard-line approach to Iran by pulling the U.S. out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.
Iran, which in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations, has yet to report on White's sentence in state-controlled media.
White's arrest was first reported by IranWire, an online news service run by Iranian expatriates.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. The New York Times first reported White's sentence.

Nearly 150 dead after cyclone hits southern African countries
HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi have been hit by a vicious cyclone that has killed nearly 150 people, left hundreds more missing and stranded tens of thousands who are cut off from roads and telephones in mainly poor, rural areas.
Cyclone Idai has affected over 1.5 million people in the three southern African nations, U.N. officials said.
Hardest hit is Mozambique's central port city of Beira where the airport is closed, electricity is out and many homes have been destroyed. The storm hit Beira late Thursday and moved westward into Zimbabwe and Malawi, affecting thousands more, particularly in eastern areas bordering Mozambique.
U.N. agencies and the Red Cross are helping with rescue efforts.

Protesters clash with police amid continued riots in Paris
PARIS -- French yellow vest protesters set fires, smashed luxury stores in Paris and clashed with police Saturday in the 18th straight weekend of demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron.
Large plumes of smoke rose above the rioting on Paris' landmark Champs-Elysees avenue.
Cobblestones flew in the air and smoke from fires set by protesters mingled with clouds of tear gas sprayed by police, as tensions continued for hours along the Champs-Elysees.
The resurgent violence comes at a watershed moment for a movement, which had been fizzling in recent weeks, and at the end of a two-month-long national debate called by Macron that protesters say failed to answer their demands for economic justice. The protests started Nov. 17.

Families given earth from Ethiopian crash site
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Grieving family members of victims of the Ethiopian air disaster are being given sacks of earth to bury in place of the remains of their loved ones.
Officials have begun delivering bags of earth to family members of the 157 victims of the crash instead of the remains of their loved ones because the identification process is going to take such a long time.
Families are being given a 2.2-pound sack of scorched earth taken from the crash sites, members of two different families told The Associated Press. An Ethiopian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity also confirmed the deliveries of soil.
Forensic DNA work may take six months to identify the victims.
A mass service for the dead is planned Sunday in Addis Ababa. Last Sunday's plane crash killed 157 people.

Man arrested in killing of reputed mob boss in NYC
NEW YORK -- A 24-year-old man was arrested Saturday in the shooting death of the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, New York City police said.
Anthony Comello was arrested in New Jersey in the death of Francesco Cali on Wednesday in front of his Staten Island home, said Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea.
"There are multiple, multiple angles that we are exploring," Shea said at a news conference at police headquarters. "Was the person paid to do it? Were others conspiring to do this crime?"
The 53-year-old Cali, a native of Sicily, was shot to death by a gunman who may have crashed his truck into Cali's car to lure him outside. Shea said Cali was shot 10 times.
Shea said police have recovered the truck but have not recovered the gun used in the murder.

Mysterious death: Newly released documents show that a former adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin had a complete fracture of his neck "at or near the time of his death" in a Washington hotel room in 2015.
The documents from the city's medical examiner were released to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
In a report published Saturday, RFE said the finding offers no clear-cut evidence of foul play in the death of Mikhail Lesin, who was a key adviser to Putin during Putin's rise to power.
The official ruling was that Lesin died of blunt force trauma after falling repeatedly while intoxicated.

Texto completo: Have you heard? Beto O'Rourke , the former Texas congressman, officially tossed his hat into the 2020 presidential race Thursday.
If you have heard the news, there's a good chance you've heard it a few different ways.
Someone may have told you that Bay-doh launched his presidential campaign. Or perhaps a friend informed you that Beat-oh is gearing up for the election.
The name, to some, can be hard to figure out. It was even a talking point during O'Rourke's failed US Senate campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year. (For the record, it's BEH-toh.)
But with a growing number of Democratic hopefuls announcing that they're running for president, O'Rourke's first name is no longer the only one tripping up talking heads and voters.
Many people are not only wondering where the emerging candidates stand on the issues — they're also figuring out how to pronounce their names properly.
Among the contenders seeking to cinch the Democratic nomination are Kamala Harri s , senator from California; Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ; Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar ; Julian Castro , former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg .
Did you get all of those right? Don't worry, you're not alone.
Seemingly trying to get ahead of any potential confusion moving forward, CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday tweeted out a helpful pronunciation guide to his followers: BET-oh, COMMA-lah, BOOT-edge-edge, KEER-sten and who-lee-AHN.
In response to Tapper's tweet, Steve Koczela , president of MassInc Polling Group, a research company that conducts telephone surveys about candidates, said pollsters spend a significant amount of time scouring the Internet for videos of candidates pronouncing their own names.
They do this, he said, so MassINC can “make good pronunciation guides for telephone interviewers" reaching out to potential voters.
“Exactly how to make it the most easy to understand and read out loud, that's what you're looking for when making a pronunciation guide," Koczela told the Globe. “That's why it's best to find the candidate saying their own name if you can."
While MassINC hasn't done any Democratic polling yet for this cycle, Koczela said the company will be having discussions about a pronunciation guide relatively soon.
Because the name confusion is nothing new for many of the candidates hoping to unseat President Trump (they've dealt with it while running for lower office), here's a quick look at how the pronunciations have been explained over the years:
■ Buttigieg penned an essay on Medium in 2016 that addressed the subject head on: “Most people have trouble pronouncing my name, so they just call me 'Mayor Pete,' " he wrote. “My surname, Buttigieg (Boot-edge-edge), is very common in my father's country of origin, the tiny island of Malta, and nowhere else."
Still, Buttigieg was asked again about his name during an interview with reporters a month later. He seemed happy to clarify.
■ Harris addressed any uncertainty about how to pronounce her name back in 2016. She did it by tweeting a campaign video of kids saying it out loud.
It's not “Cam-el-Uh," or “Kuh-Mahl-Uh," or even “Kar-mela," the kids say in the video. It's “Comma-luh."
■ When Gillibrand was appointed New York senator in 2009, one of her first tasks in office, according to The New York Times, was to teach people how to say her name right.
“It's a sibilant G," an aide told the newspaper at the time. “Jill-uh-brand."
No gill, as in the things that help fish breathe.
As for her first name? People seem to struggle with that, too. It's Keer-sten, according to the report.
■ In a campaign video on her website, Klobuchar introduces herself at the very start, making clear that it's pronounced “Klo-bush-ar."
According to Twin­Cities.com, the name Klobuchar is Slovenian, and it's pronounced with a bit of local flair. “That 'ch' is pronounced like an 'sh,"' the website reports. “And in Minnesotan, the 'bush' is really quick."
Say it again: Klo-bush-ar.
■ For Gabbard, is it Tull-see Gah-bard? Or Tool-see Guh-bard?
According to introductions at events and during interviews on national television — including an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" this month — it's fair to surmise that her name is pronounced “Toll-see GAB-urd."
■ And like many other news outlets that have doggedly covered their local politicians, the San Antonio Express-News is well ahead of the pack when it comes to clarifying how to pronounce former secretary of Housing and Urban Development's name.
In 2012, when Castro was mayor of San Antonio and a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention, the newspaper wrote about how to say Castro's first name, after hearing an XM radio DJ apparently botch the pronunciation.
The reporter put together an “easy, cheesy pronunciation guide for CNN and other Yankee-based journalists."
“Think of a baby owl who goes 'Whoooooooooooooo,' " when trying to say Julian, he wrote.
WHO-lee-an Castro — there is no hard “J," like the one in Julian Edelman.

College Admissions: Vulnerable, Exploitable And, to Many, Broken

Texto completo: Standardized test scores are manufactured. Transcripts are made up. High-stakes admissions decisions are issued based on fabricated extracurricular activities, ghostwritten personal essays and the size of the check written by the parents of the applicant.
[The college admissions scandal has raised a lot of questions. We've answered them here.]
American universities are often cast as the envy of the world, august institutions that select the best and the brightest young people after an objective and rigorous selection process.
But the bribery scandal unveiled by the Justice Department this week -- and a number of other high-profile cases that have captured the headlines in recent months -- has shown the admissions system to be something else entirely: exploitable, arbitrary, broken.
At the heart of the scandal is a persistent adulation of highly selective universities. "Elite colleges have become a status symbol with the legitimacy of meritocracy attached to them, because getting in sanctifies you as meritorious," said Jerome Karabel, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a historian of college admissions.
The case, in which dozens of parents are accused of buying spots at elite universities for their teenagers, comes amid already heightened scrutiny of college admissions.
[Learn more about how families who have legally hired college admissions consultants view the ethics of their choices.]
Last summer, a trove of secret files in a lawsuit against Harvard was made public, outlining special admissions preferences and back doors for certain applicants.
Then the news broke last fall that a Louisiana preparatory school had fabricated stories based on racial stereotypes to get its students into selective colleges.
The court papers released this week says that the organizers of the bribery scheme identified and abused weak spots in the admissions process: special accommodations in standardized testing and a system of reserving slots for students favored by athletic coaches. The parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to get higher test scores for their children and to have them fraudulently recruited for boutique sports.
The charges against the parents, who include Hollywood actresses and powerful executives, have exposed how thin the line is between admissions help that most middle-class families consider not just legitimate but de rigueur, like sending a child to a Kaplan class for SAT help, and outright fraud, like paying a ringer to take the test for the student.
[Read the full list of who has been charged here.]
In the days since the scandal broke, college consultants and admissions directors have found themselves in an awkward, sometimes defensive position. They have expressed shock at how the system was manipulated, while being acutely aware that they, as part of the system, may bear some responsibility for an admissions process that has spun out of control.
"It isn't exactly broken, it's breachable," said Theodore O'Neill, who was dean of admissions at the University of Chicago from 1989 to 2009.
Parents accused in the scandal took advantage of extra-time allowances on the ACT or SAT exams, court documents said, and bribed test administrators to allow someone else to take the tests or to correct students' answers.
Cheating on standardized tests has long been seen as an admissions vulnerability. In 2011, prosecutors on Long Island accused students of hiring others to take standardized tests for them. Testing officials have also reported troubles in Asia, where SAT and ACT scores have been delayed and, in some instances, canceled because of allegations of widespread cheating.
[Read how the college admissions scandal further fuels debate on the relevance of the SAT and ACT.]
The tests, which also routinely face attacks that they heavily favor affluent students who can afford coaching, are becoming optional at a growing number of selective schools.
Colleges say they use a "holistic" admissions system -- weighing factors like hardships and service to the community -- in part to account for the edge given to those who can attend better schools or pay for test coaching.
But reports of fraud at the T.M. Landry College Preparatory School in Breaux Bridge, La., in November have shown those measures to be vulnerable, too. A New York Times investigation found that administrators at the school had falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and exploited the worst stereotypes of black America to concoct stories that could be fed to selective schools.
[Read how students of color responded to accusations that they were admitted solely due to racial preferences.]
Some of the revelations this week were reminiscent of the secrets of admission revealed at the trial last October, in which Asian-American students rejected by Harvard accused the university of downgrading their applications based on subjective measures. Documents in the case shed light on, among other things, the little-known Dean's and Director's Interest Lists, closely guarded lists of applicants connected to top donors or other people of interest to the university, and the Z List, a back door for students who were borderline academically.
In essence, the wealthy parents accused in the federal charging documents took similar ways in. William Singer, the college consultant accused of being at the center of the bribery scheme, even called his services a "side door," according to court papers. Compared with the more traditional route of, say, endowing a building, which could cost millions, the door Mr. Singer offered cost only hundreds of thousands of dollars, a relative bargain.
[Read more about William Singer, the founder of a college preparatory business, who's at the center of the case.]
Other documents in the Harvard lawsuit showed the strong advantage that universities give to recruited athletes; at Harvard, their admission rate in recent years was 86 percent.
This week, the bribery investigation illustrated how even those preferences can be gamed.
Prosecutors said that parents funneled millions of dollars through Mr. Singer, sometimes through a charity front, to coaches, administrators and sports programs so they would designate their children as recruited athletes in boutique sports like water polo and sailing. Often the children had no experience playing on a competitive sports team, and were not expected to play once they got in.
[Here are the top college coaches implicated in the admissions scandal.]
The scandal has raised questions about whether such athletic preferences are fair -- or even necessary.
"Ivy League and sports, to me that's an oxymoron," said Christopher Hunt, a college admissions consultant.
Mr. O'Neill said that while an argument might be made for recruiting preferences in major sports like football, it was harder to justify for less popular programs.
"It seems ludicrous that basically upper-middle-class white kids are given advantages because of their capacity to play minor sports that are meaningless to most people," he said.
But other experts said that eliminating those preferences would be counterproductive.
"If you're going to have an athletics program, then you need to recruit athletes," said E. Gordon Gee, the president of West Virginia University. "If you're going to have an orchestra, you need to have orchestra players."
The investigation may spur more schools to reconsider other admission preferences, such as those for legacy students, or the children of alumni. Universities say those preferences encourage community and fund-raising, but impassioned criticism has mounted in the wake of the Harvard lawsuit, and recent news about the influence of wealth on college admissions is likely to keep that fire burning.
[Read how private college consulting, where full-service packages can go for $1.5 million, is completely legal and largely unregulated.]
According to court documents, the admission rate for legacies at Harvard was 33.6 percent. The rate for the Class of 2022 as a whole was under 5 percent.
"It's like going to the movies -- you need a ticket," said Mimi Doe, a founder of Top Tier Admissions, a college counseling service. "Your scores and grades get you in the door. But guess what? Half the seats are roped off with a big red cord."
Mr. Karabel, the sociologist, said that the bribery crisis simply reflected problems in broader society. "I think that as America has become more and more unequal, affluent parents have become desperate to pass on their privileges to their children and avoid downward mobility at all costs," he said.
Fair access to education, the engine of upward mobility, he suggested, is the casualty.

Texto completo: HEJERE, Ethiopia -- Analysis of the flight recorders of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane has begun, the airline said Friday, and The New York Times reported that the pilot requested permission "in a panicky voice" to return to the airport shortly after takeoff as the plane dipped up and down sharply and appeared to gain startling speed.

The report cited "a person who reviewed air traffic communications" from Sunday's flight saying controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.

An airline spokesman has said the pilot was given permission to return. But the plane crashed minutes later outside Addis Ababa, killing all 157 on board.

French authorities now have the plane's flight data and voice recorders for analysis. They have said it was unclear whether data could be retrieved. The data recorder appeared to show damage. Ethiopian Airlines said an Ethiopian delegation led by its chief accident investigator had arrived in Paris.

In Ethiopia, officials started taking DNA samples from victims' family members to assist in identifying remains. The dead came from 35 countries.

Countries including the United States have grounded the Boeing 737 Max 8 as the U.S.-based company faces the challenge of proving the jets are safe to fly amid suspicions that faulty software might have contributed to two crashes that killed 346 people in less than six months.

The decision to send the flight recorders to France was seen as a rebuke to the United States, which held out longer than most other countries in grounding the jets. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent three investigators to help French authorities.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said regulators had new data from the satellite-based tracking that showed the movements of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were similar to those of Lion Air Flight 610. That flight crashed into the Java Sea off Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.

The data show both planes flew with erratic altitude changes that could indicate the pilots struggled to control the aircraft. Both crews tried to return to the airport.

Boeing said it supports the grounding of its planes as a precautionary step, while reiterating its "full confidence" in the safety of the 737 Max. Engineers are making changes to the system designed to prevent an aerodynamic stall if sensors detect that the jet's nose is pointed too high and its speed is too slow.

Boeing also announced it had paused delivery of the Max, although the company planned to continue building the jets.

The Max is the latest upgrade to the Boeing 737s. Because its engines are larger and heavier, they are placed higher and farther forward on the wings. That created concern that the plane might be slightly more prone to an aerodynamic stall if not flown properly, so Boeing developed software to prevent that.

Investigators looking into the Indonesian crash are examining whether the software automatically pushed the plane's nose down repeatedly, and whether the Lion Air pilots knew how to solve that problem. Ethiopian Airlines says its pilots received special training on the software.

At the crash site in Hejere, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Addis Ababa, searchers continued to pick through the debris. Blue plastic sheeting covered the wreckage of the plane. Students from an elementary school walked an hour and a half to the site to pay respects.

Anxious family members began giving DNA samples and waited for news on the identification of remains. Members of Israel's ZAKA emergency response team were granted access to the site for forensic work.

Canada's ambassador to Ethiopia, Antione Chevrier, told The Associated Press that discussions on repatriating remains would begin once the identification process begins to yield results. "The next steps will take some time," he said. Canada lost 18 people.

"We are not told what they have found so far," Ethiopian citizen Faysal Hussein, whose cousin was killed, told the AP. "We are sitting here like forever. We were taken to the crash site on Wednesday but not allowed to get a closer look."

One relative collected soil in a plastic bag, perhaps for lack of anything else .

A Kenyan citizen, Pauline Gathu, lost a brother. Thirty-two Kenyans were killed.

"We were expecting that we will have our body well-kept but we are amazed to hear that there is nothing, totally nothing," she said. "And people are waiting for us to give them reports of what we have found but we don't have words, we don't know what to do."

Texto completo: Alec Soth is back to being afraid of people.
"Early on when I was photographing, the power dynamic was more balanced because of my fear," the renowned portraitist said in his St. Paul studio last week. "Also, I wasn't making money from the pictures. Then over time I accrued more and more power in that dynamic and it became uncomfortable."
Soth wanted to feel like he used to, before he began traveling the world for such clients as the New York Times. Before he became a favorite of the museum and gallery world. Before his images mattered as much.
This month, he returns from an extended hiatus in a big way, starting with a hometown opening Friday at Weinstein Hammons Gallery in Minneapolis for his latest project, "I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating."
The series includes 70 intimate photos, focusing on people and interior spaces in domestic settings around the world. Sixteen will make their public debut in Minneapolis, with three more gallery shows opening in New York, San Francisco and Berlin later this month, alongside a new book from prestigious London publisher Mack Books.
The journey to this series has taken several years, in part because Soth works intuitively and emotionally. His photos roll with his feelings, but they aren't autobiographical.
"I am kind of an 'emo' photographer," he said. "I just hide it a little."
The tension he felt -- between connecting with his subjects, and maintaining a certain distance from them -- has been the beating heart of Soth's art since he first gained international acclaim through his 2004 American photobook "Sleeping by the Mississippi,"
which grew out of an epic series of road trips by the painfully shy young photographer.
It was this project that initially struck Walker Art Center senior visual art curator Siri Engberg, who in 2010 organized the first U.S. survey of his work.
"They were photos that had a real honesty to them and a sense of connection between photographer and subject," she said. "Even if it was a stranger, or an empty room, or a landscape, he seemed to really have a purpose in terms of making that connection."
Soth was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, joined the prestigious Magnum Photos agency, and was compared to such celebrated artists as William Eggleston, Peter Hujar and Walker Evans.
But as his fame grew, so did the power imbalance that he felt in his work.
Meditation realization
In 2016 all these feelings culminated in a spiritual awakening that struck him like a lightning bolt.
Soth had just gotten off a flight to Finland. Jet-lagged, he went for a long walk, then sat by a lake to meditate. It "was like a drug experience, totally life-changing," as he suddenly understood some of the existential questions burdening him.
He realized "I was attracted to photography because of this distance [I could create], and for me that meditation experience was the collapse of that distance -- like 'Oh, that's all my imagination creating that distance.' I could actually see that there is no distance."
Where his earlier work seemed to come from a place of isolation or loneliness at times, he now felt a sense of relief -- happiness even.
He stopped taking editorial photo assignments. He pretty much quit taking pictures. He started making art and sculpture in an abandoned farmhouse he'd purchased an hour from the Twin Cities.
While the monk-like lifestyle was attractive to him, after a year it didn't feel sustainable. He chose to jump back into the world of commerce, and return to photography full time, but with a fresh perspective.
He wanted to tilt the metaphorical power dynamic seesaw to a more equal place, and make it a "little less predatory."
A dance that 'I am leading'
For this series, friends and colleagues referred him to potential subjects. Meetings were set up in advance. The hunt that had fatigued him became a thing of the past.
The new book begins and ends with dancers: Anna Halprin, 97, and her student Simone Forti, 84.
He said Halprin helped him become more accepting of photography's limitations, including the fact that the energy he feels while hanging out with a subject will shift when the photo shoot begins.
"There's in-between, contradictions, and you do the best you can. Just get on with it."
He recalled a conversation:
Alec: "Don't you think photography is the opposite of dance because it is stopping time?"
Anna: "No. In dance, when you stop -- it's the essence of everything you've just done."
(Not coincidentally, Soth prefers older women as therapists, though the downside is that they retire on him.)
There was one exception to his not-hunting-for-subjects rule: Nick, a guy he happened to meet while staying at an Airbnb in the Hollywood Hills.
He photographed Nick through a window, dreamily lounging on a bed, a passage from the Bible tattooed on his chest, radiant L.A. sunshine streaming in. Out-of-focus purple flowers are draped across the window. Soth is faintly visible as a reflection in the glass -- maintaining a distance, but making the viewer conscious of his presence.
"If this [photograph] is a dance, I am leading," he said. "There is an element of collaboration, and I am listening and responding to what the person said and what they want, but we are not constructing the picture together. Also, they have no concept of what the picture looks like through the lens, how the lens treats the subject, which is all in my head."
Trying to recapture a feeling
The new images capture a vulnerability that Soth, now 49, felt as a young photographer.
"Sleeping by the Mississippi" came to him easily. Hardly anyone said no to being photographed. There was a free-flowingness as he wandered south, using the Mississippi River as his guide. He also had nothing to lose -- he was still an unknown artist.
His follow-up, "Niagara" (2006), had a different vibe. He traveled to the epic falls to take pictures of people there, much like the honeymooners and suicide jumpers who go there with specific intent. He experienced a "lot of bad luck," with people thinking he was an intruder and calling the police.
For 2010's "Broken Manual," he sought out people who chose to live in isolation off the grid. His 2014 project "Songbook" offered journalistic photos decontextualized from their original stories.
Social media holds that same sort of connecting-at-a-distance sensation that Soth both enjoys and frets about. He's very active on Instagram at @littlebrownmushroom, where he posts photos from his archive, poems, realizations and promotional materials related to the new work.
He first got into social media back in 2006, when his son, Gus, was born. (He also has a daughter, Carmen.) He figured he'd be at home with the baby, so he took to blogging about photography. Long comment threads kept him company, but these platforms soon died out with the rise of Facebook.
"Facebook I wanted nothing to do with," he said. "It was just like, 'Will you be my friend?' It felt like college."
He didn't get into Instagram until he realized he could use it to experiment with visual storytelling. Although Instagram offers a comfortable distance, the hearts and likes are far from his once-busy blogging life. "I pine for the glory days of the blog," he said.
While "I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating" has a more personable quality than past projects, Soth seemed agitated when we met. He had just returned from Marfa, Texas, where he'd had a few tough social interactions. College was on his mind because of a dream the night before. He was trying to sort through the dream, itching for someone to talk to about it.
He tried to recall the sense of lightness he felt as a young and inexperienced photographer for the Lillie Suburban Newspapers chain. The assignment was to shoot Keanu Reeves, who was in town to make the 1996 film "Feeling Minnesota."
Soth was so terrified, the actor had to tell him to come closer to get the picture. Perhaps he wasn't close enough to hear Reeves' heart beating, but he could surely feel his own.

An Ex-Linebacker Now Follows an Artistic Playbook

Texto completo: "Art gave me something to segue into," said Keith Rivers, a former N.F.L. linebacker, at his art-filled house in Beverly Hills. "I've really gotten serious as far as studying, going to shows, going to all the museums I can."
Mr. Rivers, who is 32, is throwing himself into art and culture in a way few people can. He plans to move to Paris this summer and use it as a base of operations for an immersive year of learning that will include studying French and trying to visit every art museum in Europe. "That will be my art history," he said.
In the meantime, for research, he has a tall stack of old art magazines and catalogs flagged with Post-its that he referred to frequently during a recent conversation about his collection.
During his rookie season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2009, Mr. Rivers bought his first piece -- an Andy Warhol Electric Chair print -- after a trip to the Museum of Modern Art with a woman he had been interested in when he was studying at the University of Southern California. "She was an art history major and explained Oldenburg to me," he said. "I got curious." She married someone else, but the curiosity remained.
Since he retired from football in 2015, after also having played for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills, Mr. Rivers has deepened his pursuit of contemporary art and owns work by Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Kara Walker, Tony Lewis, Sonia Gomes and Arjan Martins, among others.
Works with strong graphic punch dominate his walls. Raised eyebrows and furrowed foreheads peer from a large piece by John Baldessari. A text-based canvas by Barbara Kruger proclaims, "You drive a hard bargain." Glenn Ligon's hot pink and yellow lettering on a red canvas spells out a Richard Pryor joke. In a Cyprien Gaillard piece, the cartoon face of Chief Wahoo -- the logo of the Cleveland Indians -- is superimposed on a pristine American landscape.
"It calls out the paradox of rooting for this mascot, a caricature of a Native American, and how outdated caricatures live on through marketing," Mr. Rivers said.
"So many guys get done with football, and they have nothing; that became their sole identity," he said. Art has "given me a whole new structure."
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Why did you give up football?
I'd been injured a lot. My interest was shifting toward things like art. If you're not fully into football, it's not the sport to play because you can really get hurt.
How did you initially get interested in art?
In high school, a girlfriend of mine was in a photography class. She'd pull me out of class sometimes to go take photos. In 2017, I was walking in Amsterdam with that same friend, who lives there, and she reminded me of that fact. I almost cried. I said, "Oh my God, you planted a seed for this passion."
How would you define the focus of your collection?
At the moment I'm drawn toward art that has political meaning because of the times that we're in. Issues of identity and language are highly important to me. There's an element of race in the collection.
That [canvas spelling out the date "Mar.3.1991"] is by Juan Capistrán, who was raised in South-Central. It is done in pig's blood and is Rodney King day.
John Edmonds does this "Hoods" series, which I just had to have. I grew up about 5 to 10 minutes away from Trayvon Martin's murder. You can't see anybody's face in these photographs. With a hood, you don't know who anyone could be from the back.
Do you do a lot of research before you buy, or do you go with your gut?
A little bit of both, depending on the price. Like the Glenn Ligon, I did extensive research for the best work that I could obtain. This is Lubaina Himid, the first black woman and the oldest person to win the Turner Prize. I had read about her in The New York Times, and then when I was at Basel [the art fair] this year, a friend came up and said, "You've got to come see this artist." I was able to buy it quickly because something clicked.
Are you involved with museums in any formal role?
I'm on the executive committee for the Young Patrons Group at the Hammer Museum. It's an opportunity to get people who are interested in art but may be intimidated. This is a great group to tear down some of those walls.

QUESTIONS RAISED IN DEADLY ETHIOPIAN CRASH

Texto completo: Fifty-three minutes. That was the length of time approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency for pilot training on the upgraded Boeing 737 Max 8 jet that crashed Sunday, March 10, in Ethiopia killing all aboard, according to a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.
Nor was the 53 minutes for face to face training. It was "computer assisted" over a laptop with slides and imagery. Some of the pilots felt shortchanged.
Reports in The New York Times suggest that Boeing was able to convince the FAA that the 737 pilots would not have to undergo costly retraining because the upgraded plane was enough like the older model.
This worried the pilots' group. The tragedy of Lion Air, the Ethiopia predecessor, was a focus of intense debate in aviation circles because of the determination by Boeing and the FAA that pilots did not need to be informed about a change introduced to the 737's flight control system for the MAX.
Two U.S. pilots' unions said the potential risks of a safety feature on Boeing Co.'s 737 Max aircraft that had been linked to a deadly crash in Indonesia weren't sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training.
The Lion Air crash took the lives of 189 people. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation.
Meanwhile, relatives, coworkers and friends of the Ethiopian Air victims remain stunned at the untimely loss of over 149 passengers and eight crew members. Flight 302, known as the "U.N. shuttle" to some, was carrying at least 32 Kenyans, eight Canadians, nine each from Ethiopia and France, eight each from the U.S., China and Italy, seven from Britain and one from Nigeria.
Some were employed at the U.N.'s World Food Program, six were from the U.N. office in Nairobi, and two each for its Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights and the International Telecommunications Union.
The Food and Agriculture Organization, International Organization for Migration in South Sudan, World Bank and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Somalia each lost one staff member. Six staff from the U.N. Office in Nairobi were also tragically killed.
Among the private citizens lost in the crash was Pius Adesanmi, professor and news columnist, "a rare being, ebullient, with a razor-sharp mind," wrote Nigerian author O.C. Osundu. "He was what the Yoruba call an Omoluabi yet when it cams to polemics he could easily morph into a jaguda... good night my brother... we both came a long way. Nigeria has lost one of those who loved her most."
The airline identified the pilot as Yared Getachew and the first officer as Ahmednur Mohammed. Getachew had more than 8,000 flight hours. He was a "confident captain" according to his family.
The flight was carrying a high number of U.N. workers because it was the day before a session of the U.N. Environment Assembly.
Professor Adesanmi, before Sundays flight, posted an eerily prescient photo of himself holding his Canadian passport, along with the text of Psalm 139.9-10.
"If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea," it read, "even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me."

SATURDAY
>> Dance collective L.A. Dance Project spins classic works at Blaisdell
There’s a saying that all of Bach’s music is based on dance. Now you’ll get a chance to see how dance can be inspired by Bach, when the acclaimed L.A. Dance Project makes its debut in Honolulu this weekend, courtesy of Ballet Hawaii.
The dance collective was founded in 2012 by former City Ballet (New York) choreographer/dancer Benjamin Millepied, whose work got its widest exposure in the Academy Award-winning 2010 film “Black Swan.” (Millepied choreographed the moves for its star, Natalie Portman; they would later marry.) L.A.D.P. made a splash in the dance world, attracting top dancers from around the world to Los Angeles.
The company will perform some of its most popular works. “Bach Studies” features Millepied’s take on the composer’s “Violin Partita in D Minor,” including its famous final movement, a lengthy Chaconne. The choreography sends dancers winding, unwinding and leaping across the stage in intertwining patterns reminiscent of Bach’s multi-voiced contrapuntalism.
Also on the program are a set of duets inspired by Martha Graham film “A Dancer’s World.” After a 2016 performance of the duets, the New York Times praised the dance as “brief, economical and intensely varied,” and “unusual views of Graham at her most unpredictable and enduringly contemporary.”
L.A. DANCE PROJECT
>> Where: Blaisdell Concert Hall
>> When: 7:30 p.m. Saturday
>> Cost: $30 to $75
>> Info: 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com
SUNDAY
>> Saint Patrick’s Day Block Party features fun and fundraising
Go Irish for the day and head over to the streets surrounding Murphy’s Bar & Grill for its annual Saint Patrick’s Day Block Party. When you eat as the Irish do, you’ll help raise funds for local charities.
The party/fundraiser has been supporting charitable organizations for more than 30 years through its sales of corned beef. About 3,000 pounds will be prepared for this years’ event, with $2 donated for every pound sold. Corned beef and cabbage plates will go for $14, or get a corned beef sandwich and fries for $10. Bring your appetite.
Throughout the afternoon and evening, entertainment will be provided by Doolin Rakes, a mainstay of the Irish pub scene for 16 years, along with vintage soul band The Elevations. Starting at noon, there will be fun and games for kids. After 4 p.m., the adult revelry is expected to ramp up.
For more Irish-style celebrating, head to Waikiki earlier in the day for the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade, beginning at noon, heading down Kalakaua Avenue from Saratoga Road to Monsarrat Avenue. Roads will be closed to traffic beginning at 11:30 a.m.

>> ‘Bad Feminist,’ great pundit Roxane Gay offers opinions
Roxane Gay, author of the 2014 New York Times bestseller “Bad Feminist,” has emerged as one of the most perceptive observers of America today. She brings her commentary to Hawaii Theatre on March 21.
Gay speaks to readers entranced by her essays examining the tensions between her positions, as both a feminist and admirer of “feminine” behavior. She’s both an advocate for women’s empowerment on issues such as abortion rights, and an admirer of the young adult “Sweet Valley High” romance novels.
Gay also has written about her upbringing as a Haitian-American growing up in Nebraska, coming out, sexual abuse and other cultural and political topics. Recently she’s become a powerful voice against fat-shaming.
Her career path reads like a travelogue and adventure series. She’s been a professor at Eastern Illinois University, Purdue and Yale. She wrote for Marvel Comics’ “World of Wakanda” series, an off-shoot from Marvel’s “Black Panther” franchise, and founded her own publishing house, Tiny Hardcore Press. She is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, where she offers advice to letter writers.
Her appearances have been described as blending stand-up comedy, political commentary and advice, laced with opinion.

Herman: We’re the University of Texas. We’re elite.*

Texto completo: So many people for so many years have worked toward the day when UT would be mentioned among the elite schools of our nation. That day has come. It was Tuesday.
Second only to winning football games, UT strives for national recognition as a top-tier school, worthy of mention in the same breath as elites such as Yale, Stanford and Georgetown universities. OK, so the Tuesday mention came in a
federal indictment, but, hey, mention is mention and elite is elite.
Thanks to the indictment, lots of national publications are saying UT is elite. How cool is that?
The New York Times: “Here’s How the FBI Says Parents Cheated to Get Their Kids Into Elite Colleges.” The Atlantic reported the FBI uncovered “a massive bribery scheme to secure admission into some of the country’s most elite colleges.” A USA Today headline said, “College coaches, celebrities charged in largest-ever bribery case at elite schools.”
UT, thanks to the indictment of now-fired tennis Coach Michael Center, is counted among those elite schools. Hook ’em!
“Authorities say nine coaches at elite universities accepted bribes of ‘enormous sums’ from 33 parents in exchange for admitting students as athletes, regardless of their ability,” USA Today reported.
Even Forbes had UT among the elites, noting the feds allege 50 people, including Center, participated in “in a $25 million bribery and cheating scheme to get the children of wealthy parents into elite colleges.”
In announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling of Boston spoke of big bucks spent by big-bucked parents “to guarantee their children’s admission to elite schools.”
Elite, baby, elite. Eat it, not-on-the-list Texas A&M University.
The feds’ news release about the case spoke of a conspiracy “that facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and the admission of students to elite universities.” One quibble: The feds’ announcement also said, “Athletic coaches from Yale, Stanford, USC, Wake Forest and Georgetown, among others, are implicated.”
C’mon, feds. Would it have killed you to give UT a shout-out as opposed to relegating it to inclusion in the “among others” category?
Sure, if you focus on the wrong thing this whole episode can seem tawdry. But having UT, Yale and Stanford lumped together as elites? It’d be hard to (pardon the expression) bribe your way into that kind of mention. This one’s got it all: scandal, sports, skullduggery, selebrity. (Sorry about that last one. I did not attend an elite college.) It’s a combination that helps this story permeate multiple layers of our national consciousness, equally interesting to ESPN and E!
For many, it’s a learning experience. Who knew there was collegiate sailing? And shouldn’t there be a congressional investigation anytime the U.S. Naval Academy doesn’t win the national sailing title?
Who knew that actress Felicity Huffman’s daughters were into crew? I’m told (by troubling and demonic voices in my head) that this whole scam blew up when a teammate met the Huffman daughters and said, “Funny, you don’t like crewish.”
Bottom line here: Sure, this can be viewed as embarrassing to UT. But optimists must bask in the bright side of the national attention: elite.
Local lawyer Robert Ettinger gets it.
“People here in Austin have completely missed the point regarding the college admissions scandal,” he told me. “UT-Austin is now an elite school mentioned in the same sentence as Stanford and Yale.”
Same sentence. Same sentencing. Mention is mention.
“And to think I graduated from an elite school in 1981 that only cost $250 per semester for a full course load,” Ettinger said.
As we do on so many days, we wish Cronkite was still among us. Perhaps he could modify the tagline on his wonderful promo ads for UT, maybe something like: “What starts here, winds up at the grand jury and gets us elite status.”
Or, maybe this: “We’re Texas. We’re elite.*”

Iran Gives Rights Lawyer 38 Years and 148 Lashes

Texto completo: Iran has faced international condemnation after one of the country's most prominent human rights lawyers, detained for eight months, said she had been sentenced to a total of 38 years in prison and 148 lashes, according to her husband.
Security agents arrested the lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, at her home in June last year. The government offered no explanation, but at the time Ms. Sotoudeh was defending women who had been arrested after removing their hijabs, or head scarves, in public protests.
She received the European Union's most prestigious human rights award, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 2012, while serving a previous prison sentence.
Ms. Sotoudeh, held at Evin Prison in Tehran, told her husband about the latest sentencing during a brief telephone conversation, the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a monitoring group, said in a statement on Monday.
The husband, Reza Khandan, described the sentences in a Facebook post on Monday, saying that she had received a five-year prison term in one case and a sentence of 33 years in another. She was also sentenced to 148 lashes, he said.
A report the same day from a state-funded news outlet, the Iranian Students' News Agency, quoted a hard-line judge, Mohammad Moghiseh, as saying that he had sentenced Ms. Sotoudeh to a total of seven years in prison and mentioning two charges, of taking part in an illegal assembly and collusion against the state.
According to the Center for Human Rights statement, however, the first case in which Ms. Sotoudeh had been sentenced appeared to relate to a 2015 trial conducted in her absence. Her husband told the center that she had faced at least seven charges in the second case, among them propaganda against the state, disturbing public peace and order, appearing in court without a head scarf, and encouraging corruption and prostitution.
"I don't know how many years she got for each of the charges because my conversation with Nasrin only lasted a few minutes and we didn't get to the details," the center quoted Mr. Khandan as saying. "I only know that the biggest sentence was 12 years," he said, for the charge of encouraging corruption and prostitution.
"This verdict shows that making statements in our country comes with such a high price that an attorney can be sentenced to 44 years for it," he told the center.
"I say 44 years because in 2010 she was sentenced to six years in prison for similar charges," he added. "This sentence is unjust, illogical and unusual."
During the most recent sentencing, Judge Moghiseh "applied the maximum statutory sentence" for each of her charges, and added an additional four years to her prison term, Amnesty International said in a news release on Monday.
Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, called the sentence "utterly outrageous" on Tuesday, and said on Twitter that the European Parliament stood with Ms. Sotoudeh.
Jeremy Hunt, Britain's foreign secretary, also condemned the decision on Twitter.
"Shocked to hear reports that dedicated Iranian women's rights campaigner and human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh has been sentenced to years in prison and 148 lashes," he wrote.
"Human rights should be defended, not prosecuted," he added.
Ms. Sotoudeh was not the only member of her family to be sentenced to prison this year.
Mr. Khandan, her husband, was sentenced to six years in January for illicitly posting updates about his wife's case on Facebook, but he has yet to be imprisoned on that charge, Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, which is based in New York, told The New York Times last week.
The couple has two young children.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo que firmará una orden de emergencia para aterrizar todos los vuelos de aviones Boeing 737 Max 8 y 737 Max 9 de las aerolíneas estadounidenses.
De este modo, cualquier avión similar al que se estrelló en Etiopía que actualmente se encuentre en el aire irá a su destino y se mantendrá en tierra hasta nuevo aviso.
“Esos aviones serán aterrizados de inmediato “, dijo Trump en la Casa Blanca. “La seguridad es nuestra principal preocupación” .
Estados Unidos fue la única nación que pilotea aviones Boeing 737, después de que Canadá anunció el miércoles que estaba aterrizando dichas naves. Esta decisión afectaría, aún indeterminadamente, vuelos programados.
La Unión Europea y varios países ya habían tomado la decisión el fin de semana de retirar las aeronaves mencionadas, pero el CEO del fabricante de aviones buscaba evitar que el presidente Trump tomada una decisión similar, luego del siniestro con una aeronave de de Ethiopian Airlines.
Dennis Muilenburg , director ejecutivo de Boeing, con sede en Chicago, habló con el presidente Trump por teléfono el martes por la mañana para evitar que sus aviones fueran retirados, informó The New York Times.
El Times citó a dos personas familiarizadas con la llamada, sobre lo cual Muilenburg afirmó que expresó al mandatario estadounidense que las aeronaves eran seguras.
Desde el fin de semana, el valor de las acciones de Boeing se han desplomado y se espera que bajen más tras el anuncio del presidente Trump.
El martes, el presidente Trump abogó por aviones “más simples”, pero no habló de suspender las operaciones de los Boeing.
“Los aviones se están volviendo demasiado difíciles para volar. Ya no se necesitan pilotos, sino científicos informáticos del MIT”, dijo en su cuenta en Twitter, en referencia al Instituto de Tecnología de Massachusetts. “Lo he visto todo el tiempo con varios productos… siempre buscando pasos innecesarios…”
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
“Las decisiones en décimas de segundo son necesarias y la complejidad crea peligro. Todo esto por un gran costo pero muy pocos beneficios. No sé tú, pero yo no quiero que Albert Einstein sea mi piloto. ¡Quiero excelentes profesionales de vuelo que puedan tomar el control de un avión de forma fácil y rápida!”, afirmó.
….needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
El siniestro en Etiopía murieron 157 personas; se reportó que las víctimas son de al menos 35 nacionalidades, incluyendo al menos un estadounidense y 18 canadienses, algunos de los cuales viajaban a ese país a buscar sus orígenes, ya que sus familiares migraron a Estados Unidos hace varios años.

Is anti-Semitism exceptional?

Texto completo: Like most places, America has always had potent strains of anti-Semitism - crude and polished, KKK and country club. But unlike many places, we have always had important strains of philo-Semitism as well; there is a long American tradition, with both Protestant and Enlightenment roots, of really liking Judaism and the Jews.
And so the story of the Jews in post-World War II America is the story, not just of anti-Semitism's marginalization, but of philo-Semitism's triumph. Jewish Americans weren't just integrated, like other ethnic and religious groups. They also attracted a particular sympathy and admiration, rooted in Holocaust remembrance, affection for Israel, and a distinctive pride in the scope of their success.
For American philo-Semites, the Jewish experience wasn't just one minority experience among many, but a signal and elevated case. The outsize success of Jewish intellectuals and scientists and artists and businessmen and activists was an especially good thing, a unique proof of American exceptionalism - because ours was the one country where a people so long persecuted could not only survive but triumph. And attacks on Jewish success and influence, like attacks on the state of Israel, were treated as particularly dangerous, particularly un-American, because they threatened to undo this great achievement, and return the Jews to their historic state of constant threat and peril.
This history supplies one way to understand the stakes in the controversy over Ilhan Omar, the Muslim congresswoman who keeps using anti-Semitic cliches in her criticisms of the American-Israeli relationship. The part of the American left that's defending her, or at least mitigating her offense and accusing her conservative critics of bad faith, doesn't see itself as defending Jew-hatred, and since many of those defenders are Jewish - including the arguable front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders - it's reasonable to take them at their word.
But the defend-Omar project is a project that seeks to push us away from the age of philo-Semitism, the age in which both American Jews and the American-Israel relationship were considered special cases among the range of minority groups and foreign policy partnerships.
This is what the left seems to want in the Omar controversy, and what I suspect it will eventually get: a left-of-center politics that remembers the Holocaust as one great historical tragedy among many, that judges Israel primarily on its conservative and nationalist political orientation, rather than on its status as a Jewish sanctuary, and that regards the success of American Jews as a reason for them to join white Gentiles in check-your-privilege self-criticism, ceding moral authority to minority groups who are more immediately oppressed. (This last shift was helpfully distilled by James Clyburn, the Democratic House whip, who defended Omar by basically saying that the Holocaust was a long time ago and her personal experience as a refugee and Muslim immigrant was more immediate and relevant.)
The shifts here would not just be, as is sometimes suggested, a reaction to Israeli politics, to the right-wing Netanyahu government or the cruelties of occupation. If the occupation ended tomorrow, Israel would still have a nationalist and religious identity at odds with the left's broadly post-nationalist and post-religious vision. Secularization would still be separating the left from any specifically Christian sense of guilt over the Holocaust - which was an important spur to postwar philo-Semitism. Many American Jews would still enjoy advantages that expose them to the left's intersectional critiques, and the Orthodox Jewish population (growing apace relative to more secular and liberal forms of Judaism) would still have religious beliefs and practices that are the very opposite of woke.
Finally, a great deal of the new anti-Semitism - from the recent wave of hate crimes in New York City to the anti-Jewish violence befouling Europe - would still be coming from minority and immigrant communities that are seen as essential to left-of-center and especially radical-left politics going forward, making them more difficult than right-wing anti-Semitism for the left to full-throatedly condemn.
Of course right-wing anti-Semites haven't gone away either - which is part of why anti-anti-Omar Democrats can tell themselves that by downgrading Jewish exceptionalism, trading a specific philo-Semitism for a general politics of all-bigotry-is-bad, they are asking liberal Jews to make a sacrifice that's essential for the greater good of defeating the greater enemy, which is still the reactionary right.
Whether this argument works depends in part on what the post-Trump right ultimately becomes - whether there's a way to marry nationalism and philo-Semitism, perhaps wooing Jewish voters rightward, or whether any form of right-wing populism inevitably brings anti-Semitism roaring back.
But it also depends on whether the assumptions of Omar's left-wing defenders are justified - whether anti-Semitism can be contained if it's treated as one form of bigotry among many, or whether the perverse resilience of Jew-hatred is such that cultures choose between philo-Semitism and anti-Semitism, with only a swift downward slope lying in between.

Texto completo: Ben Affleck and Oscar Isaac lead the cast of a new heist movie on Netflix. And Helen Mirren plays a famous, troubled widow in "Winchester."
What's Streaming
TRIPLE FRONTIER (2019) Stream on Netflix. Action comes with a side of self-righteousness in this heist movie, directed by J. C. Chandor ("All Is Lost," "A Most Violent Year"). It pits a gang of burly American veterans (played by Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac and a few others) against a drug lord (Rey Gallegos) and his cronies. The vets are after a stash of drug money. The movie -- like a militarized "Ocean's Eleven" -- follows them as they plan and execute an infiltration of the narcotics guys' forest lair. That it doesn't go exactly as planned is about as unsurprising as the fact that most of the macho fighters have facial hair. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film a "slickly enjoyable, bankrupt take on a fail-safe formula."
What's on TV
WINCHESTER (2018) 6:15 p.m. on Showtime 2. Whether the creaky, century-old Northern California mansion that Sarah Winchester, the heiress to the Winchester Repeating Arms fortune, had built is actually haunted by the spirits of those killed by Winchester rifles has been a matter of debate for generations. But the twisting halls of that weird old home have for years been roamed by at least one collection of restless souls: tourists who want to be spooked. The real Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, Calif., was used as a filming location for this fact-bending thriller, based on Winchester's later years. Helen Mirren plays Winchester as a widow whose decades-long home-building project reflects her troubled mental state. Jason Clarke portrays a psychologist hired to help her. Those familiar with the story might appreciate seeing a local legend come to life. Viewers simply looking for a good scary movie, however, may leave unsatiated. In her review for The Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that "despite the typically elevating presence of Helen Mirren, this super-silly feature (the fifth from the Australian brothers Peter and Michael Spierig) stubbornly resists being classed up."
LOVE & BASKETBALL (2000) 5:35 p.m. on BET. A far less gloomy California tale is the focus of this romance movie, which was the directorial debut of Gina Prince-Bythewood. It charts a relationship between two basketball players whose preadolescent Los Angeles friendship eventually blossoms -- along with the potential of their basketball careers -- into more.
EPIC YELLOWSTONE 8 p.m. on Smithsonian Channel. Bill Pullman hosts this nature series about the beautiful and treacherous home that Yellowstone National Park makes for the many species there. "Fire and Ice," the episode showing on Wednesday, focuses on winter. The episode's title should not be confused with George R. R. Martin's fantasy book series "A Song of Ice and Fire," the source material for "Game of Thrones" -- though the calculated ways one bobcat hunts its prey here could give Martin's characters a run for their money.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.

Texto completo: As technology becomes increasingly pervasive in American life, universities across the United States have been devising ways to teach students how to grapple with the consequences on society.
Now, 21 leading universities are banding together to promote their various programs. On Monday, the schools announced that they had formed a new organization called the Public Interest Technology University Network.
Members of the group include Arizona State University, the City University of New York, Harvard University, Howard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. Their goal is to train the next generation of software engineers, policymakers, civic leaders and social justice advocates to develop, regulate and use technology for the public good.
In other words, the group aims to both humanize technologists and technologize humanists.
"We think about two halves of the pipeline," said Alexandra Givens, executive director of the Institute for Technology Law and Policy at Georgetown Law School. "One is helping technologists think about the social, ethical, legal and policy implications of their work."
The other, she said, is helping students interested in law, government and nonprofit careers to learn computational and technology skills to serve the public.
"We spend a ton of time telling students, 'If you care about civil rights in America today, or if you care about criminal justice reform, you have to understand technology and speak up about how technology is being deployed,"' Professor Givens said.
Public interest technology combines existing academic disciplines like computer science, law and sociology. The need for such an interdisciplinary field has recently taken on added urgency after a spate of scandals at Facebook, Google and other tech firms.
Students are now clamoring for new technology courses and degree programs that make the public good a priority over industry agendas -- and universities, along with foundations that support them, are rushing to respond.
"We can't pretend that the technology companies are set up to work in the public interest," said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation. "They are constructed to work on behalf of private interests, the interests of their owners and their shareholders."
Since 2015, the Ford Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation and other nonprofit groups have invested more than $18 million to advance the field of public interest technology.
The idea of interdisciplinary technology studies, however, is not new.
In 1971, Stanford became one of the first universities in the United States to offer an academic program now called Science, Technology and Society, a field that has become a mainstay at many other universities. In 2005, Princeton created the Center for Information Technology Policy, where researchers study the vulnerabilities of technologies like electronic voting machines and teach courses with titles like "Artificial Intelligence and Public Policy."
Arizona State University, another early adopter, has a well-established Ph.D. program in the human and social dimensions of science and technology. It also has a research center devoted to advancing responsible research in innovation.
The new university network is working to rebrand such efforts as "public interest technology."
"Public interest technology is a critically important area for our attention," said Mark Searle, executive vice president of Arizona State. "As technology becomes more ubiquitous, it is essential we consider the impacts on people, whether unintended consequences or designs that exclude certain groups or disadvantage them in some way."
The universities are not simply trying to unite existing and nascent programs under one academic umbrella. Their strategy is to make public interest technology as integral to the technology industry as public interest law is to the legal profession.
In the late 1960s, the Ford Foundation began developing strategies to train law school students to work on behalf of the public, including minorities and immigrants. It also financed new legal advocacy groups like the Native American Rights Fund.
As part of that movement, law schools began to create clinics where students could provide legal services to the public. Law firms made pro bono work part of their mandates. And new areas of legal expertise developed, including environmental and human rights law. Along the way, Skadden Arps and other prominent law firms started fellowship programs that pay graduating law students to work for public interest law firms and advocacy organizations.
Proponents have similar aims for public interest technology. They envision new degree programs, new organizations and new career pathways for both tech company employees and students.
"The idea that a young person could look at a tech career and see that as a path to working in the Justice Department, or any nongovernment organization or local government agency, as much as going to a tech company is something that I think is badly needed," said Anne-Marie Slaughter, the chief executive of New America, a research organization in Washington whose focus includes public interest technology. (New America has received funding from tech companies like Facebook and Google, as well as the Ford Foundation).
This semester, for instance, M.I.T. and Georgetown Law are offering a joint course in privacy law and technology. In the class, small teams of M.I.T. engineering students and Georgetown law students work together to study issues like the use of smartphone geolocation tracking by police departments. Then, the teams are assigned to write privacy legislation regulating the technology.
Rachel Wei, a computer science major at M.I.T. who is taking the course, said she felt that she was "picking up an entire new field" in one semester.
"Everybody who is researching, working at these big companies," Ms. Wei said, "believes that what they're doing is good. But we have to understand the other side of the issue."
In an era when tech giants seem to have unchecked power, Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation said encouraging students to enter public interest tech was all the more important.
"If this new digital world, which is supposed to be so much better and supposed to help us all solve centuries-old challenges, actually compounds those problems, it will be in part because there's not enough people fighting for the public interest," Mr. Walker said.

Texto completo: California may soon follow Pennsylvania's lead in sealing criminal records for nonviolent offenders who did the crime and paid their time.
The New York Times reported` that California lawmakers are weighing a proposal similar to Pennsylvania's law and may take it one step better. While the Pennsylvania law kicks in only after a former inmate has stayed trouble free for 10 years, the California measure now winding its way through the legislature there would seal such records from the public automatically after an individual has completed his or her sentence and paid any outstanding fines.
Like Pennsylvania's Clean Slate Law, the California proposal would permit law enforcement agencies to continue to access to the data. But advocates say limiting public access ensures such records will no longer be a bar to employment and housing that can follow former inmates for decades.
Last summer Pennsylvania became the first state in the nation to pass a so-called Clean Slate law. The Pennsylvania measure that takes effect this year calls for authorities to seal the records of those convicted of misdemeanor and summary crimes, provided they have served their time, paid their fines and have stayed out of trouble for at least a decade. It also provides for arrest records that did not result in a conviction to be sealed.
Court officials in Pennsylvania are preparing to launch a computer program that would scrub hundreds of thousands of old records that meet that criteria.
Authorities in California could have an even bigger job on their hands if that state's version of a Clean Slate bill becomes law.
The New York Times reported that about eight million Californians have criminal records. Like the Pennsylvania law, the California measure would apply retroactively to those with old records who meet the criteria of the law.

Texto completo: Priscilla Villarreal es una reportera sobre cuatro ruedas: hace lo que ella llama “noticias en movimiento” desde su “demonio azul” , la camioneta con la que recorre las calles de la fronteriza ciudad de Laredo, Texas . Su forma de hacer periodismo es novedosa ya que combina todas las posibilidades que brinda Facebook y, a la vez, cuenta en espanglish historias que pueden ser de utilidad para sus más de 120 000 seguidores (y sumando).
Hija de migrantes mexicanos, Lagordiloca , como se hace llamar en la red social, nació en Estados Unidos hace 34 años. Después de dejar la escuela a temprana edad, tuvo varios trabajos, el último de ellos en un desguace para el que recogía chatarra de tráileres inservibles. Desde 2015, su trabajo como reportera de exclusivas locales ha dado un giro a su vida ya que, según dijo al diario New York Times, le ha ayudado a superar los problemas de depresión y estrés postraumático que venía sufriendo tras la pérdida prematura de su bebé hace alrededor de diez años.
Con una forma desenfadada y directa de contar las noticias, Villarreal informa sobre accidentes de tráfico, redadas policiales o crímenes locales . También ha contadado en primicia temas relacionados con corruptelas en el seno de las autoridades policiales de su ciudad, que han supuesto incluso su detención en un debate sobre los límites de la libertad de expresión del que salió airosa .
Junto con la información, comparte también su opinión sobre el caso y envuelve todo en un ya característico tono de “chisme” . “Yo hablo el lenguaje de las calles y por eso la gente me sigue” – reconoció en una entrevista. En su página de Facebook también se ven artículos de otros medios y recomendaciones de sus lugares favoritos . La pequeña cantidad de ingresos que recibe de los restaurantes que frecuenta le permite continuar con su carrera como reportera.
Los videos en directo por Facebook son su canal estrella de comunicación. Los empieza con un recurrente “¡Qué rollo!” y, a través de ellos, revela las exclusivas, cuenta en pantalla lo que está sucediendo e, incluso, habla de su vida personal y responde al momento a los comentarios de sus seguidores . Por todo ello, no ha tardado en hacerse popular y ha cosechado un gran número de fans -que la paran por la calle para pedirle fotos y autógrafos- pero tambien algunos haters -que critican su aspecto físico o su forma de hacer comunicación.

Texto completo: Headnote Can't decide where to go? Leave it to a 'surprise travel' planner
To treat her husband - and herself - Britni Virgil signed up for a three-day trip later this month. They have no idea where they are going, or how they will get there, but that's all part of the fun.
She handed over these important details to a "surprise travel" tour operator, a travel agency that plans trips to varying degrees of detail, but only discloses the flight itineraries, lodging and other information at the last minute.
"I love planning vacations, but with life so busy right now - we're moving, trying to sell a house and I'm pregnant - I thought this style of trip would eliminate all of the time and energy that goes into planning," Virgil, a 33-year-old blogger from Keller, Texas, said.
These companies are gambling that travelers like Virgil will like the idea of a vacation that hinges on suspense, and that they will want to ditch predictability (and a slog themselves through vacation options) for mystery, something often lacking in today's travel landscape.
Affordable experiences for everyone
Virgil booked her trip with Pack Up and Go, a domestic travel company offering budget-friendly, three-day getaways by plane, train or car. The price tag includes airfare and lodging (usually boutique hotels that showcase the local character), but the daily itinerary is determined by travelers themselves.
With Pack Up and Go and most other surprise planners, travelers take an initial survey online that establishes their budget, gauges their interests and determines the style of their trip (choices include adventure trips, cultural excursions or relaxing retreats).
A week before departure, Pack Up and Go Clients receive an email with a weather forecast and packing recommendations. A physical envelope, to be opened at the airport, arrives a day or two before departure and contains flight and hotel information.
The Vacation Hunt also offers flat-fee trips, which range from three to 14 days with stays at budget-conscious lodging in city centers. Its trips have the added thrill of emailed clues ("Hope you enjoy indulging! Your surprise destination had over 1,000 beers to try!") sent to travelers before their departure. Along with a survey, the firm searches and sifts through clients' social media accounts to assess their interests and pair them with a destination.
Packages like "All-American Adventures" and "International Intrigue" include flights, accommodations and at least two activities such as a food tour or entry to a museum. Anniversaries and other special occasions are the company's specialty, with five- or six-day international trips to destinations like Portugal, Spain, Aruba or Panama.
Brooks Jimenez, 37, and his girlfriend, Nicole Dudash, 35, have taken two trips with The Vacation Hunt, saying that the convenience, the fixed price and the element of surprise were main draws.
"Our first trip to Paris - based on the interests of culture and food - included a three-day museum pass and a food tour in Montmartre," he said. "The next year, we wanted more of an active adventure and ended up in Costa Rica doing white water rafting, zip lining and horseback riding."
(Prices per person for Pack and Go trips that include flights are about $850, while road trips are approximately $400. For The Vacation Hut, prices per person for domestic trips start at $750 for four days, while international trips start at $950 per person.)
Go off the beaten path
Catering to younger travelers, Anywhr specializes on lesser-known spots within Asia and Europe. Yilan, a town in northeast Taiwan with natural hot springs, whale-watching and night markets, is one of its destinations. Another is Darwin, Australia's northernmost city known for coves of crocodiles, aboriginal culture and hikes through Kakadu National Park.
The company creates an online client profile according to the type of vacation a traveler is seeking, with options including adventure, relaxation or "wildcard." Traveler interests and accommodation preferences are also recorded. After signing on, clients receive a teaser email to help with packing and then, a week before departure, a physical "travelogue" arrives with flight information, lodging details, local recommendations and $30 worth, of the country's currency.
(Prices per person start at $330 for three-day trips, and can go up to $10,000 per person for a 15-day honeymoon option.)
A luxury getaway - at a luxury price
More intricately designed trips are available if you're willing to spend. Black Tomato's Get Lost program can involve up to six months of planning, and features luxury elements like helicopter transfers and luxury camps in remote corners of the globe.
Travelers customize the level of "escapism" they want, using filters for their maximum flight time, a preferred environment (polar, jungle, desert, mountain or coastal), and other factors. "Roll the dice" is one choice: Travelers may land in Mongolia, Svalbard or Guyana.
Pricier options involve a private flight with blacked-out windows, and upon arrival, a survival "kit" with a satellite phone, preprogrammed checkpoints and clothes based on the environment.
(Prices per person vary depending on destination and level of support. A recent three-day trek in Morocco was priced at $5,800 per person, and a seven-day private trip to a more remote location starts at $20,000 per person and includes 24-hour on-the-ground support and supplies.)

Texto completo: Headnote Power of the Pen
Three of arguably the most important and prolific writers of our time sat down on March 5 at Howard University's Cramton Auditorium for the "Power of the Pen" panel discussion to chat about writing, research, work and loving our Blackness. But the evening quickly morphed into a master class on pushing yourself towards excellence no matter what your field.
SPOILER ALERT - The answer to most every question in life is read more.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Jelani Cobb took the stage at Howard Cramton Auditorium in front of an intimate but enthusiastic crowd. The event was hosted by Anthony Brown, a Howard alum and communications specialist for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of the Inspector General.
The trio, who are friends in real life, have a list of credits and honors most people never achieve. Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist covering Civil Rights and Racial injustice for the {New York Times}. She is the recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, The National Magazine Award and the National Association of Black Journalists Salute to Excellence Award.
Coates is a writer of residence at NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He wrote the bestselling books, "The Beautiful Struggle," "We Were Eight Years in Power" and "Between the World and Me," which won the National Book Award. Coates is also the author of Marvel comics such as "The Black Panther" and "Captain America," and a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship.
Dr. Cobb is an Ira A. Lipman Professor of Journalism at Columbia University. Cobb has been staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015. He is a recipient of fellowships from the Fulbright and Ford Foundations. He is also the author of "The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress" as well as "To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic." He is also a Howard alum.
Brown asked Coates why it was important for him to be on at the panel discussion and the author was quick to point out the school's contribution to his life.
"It's quite impossible for me to imagine any success or my life at all personal or professional without Howard," Coates, who attended the university, said. "I met my wife here. I met Jelani here. My first articles were published in the Community News and Hilltop."
He went on to say, "I will owe Howard until the day I die."
Brown asked Cobb to unpack what he does as a writer.
"I think I am a Black man trying to be responsible to his community and times," Cobb said.
"I'm a historian and a journalist. But my mission has always been to use the tools that I gained at this institution in a way that was befitting the people who invested in me."
Hannah-Jones was able to unpack her process and debunk the myth of objectivity in journalism, all in one answer.
"I don't believe in objectivity. I've made that very clear," Hannah-Jones said.
She went on to say: "I don't pretend to be objective and I think objectivity has been the shield that mainstream White media and journalists hide behind when they make decisions that clearly many of us think are biased, when they decide who they're going to cover, what goes on the front page. These are all subjective decisions on what they think are important."
"I don't choose to hide behind that at all. But for me what is important is to be accurate and fair. Can you dispute the reporting? Is there anything in the reporting that is not true and was I fair to the parties involved?"
Hannah-Jones said her journalism is more aligned with the tradition of Black journalists and Black media.
"How did someone like Ida B. Wells be objective when reporting in a country where Black people didn't have citizenship rights?" she asked. "In a country that is in opposition to their existence. In a country that is in opposition to their humanity. You can't pretend you have no stakes in the game."
But developing good work is the most important part of the job. "You have to be excellent, you can't just be good," Hannah-Jones said.
Dr. Cobbs echoed the sentiment that the next generation of writers have to focus on the output not the outlet.
"People come to me and say, 'I want you to get me into The New Yorker.' as opposed to saying, 'I want you to help me to get my work to be good enough that it belongs in The New Yorker," Cobbs said. "It's the aspiration and the ambition without the idea of the caliber of the work going first."
Coates broke down the essential responsibility of being a Black journalist.
"It's really not enough for you to just go out and be a relatively successful journalist," Coates said. "It's not enough for you to go get a job at the New York Times, or get a job at The New Yorker or The Atlantic, where I was. You have to use the work that you create once you get there as a sword. You're at war."
"You're not just a journalist. You are a journalist in cause of something."
Coates continued saying: "Your job is to be excellent but excellent in the course of something. When you think about what this long struggle is about, it's actually about the future of humanity. Your job is to use your power you have as a journalist, as a writer to not be amongst that group of people who are trying to push the world over the cliff."
But Coates said understanding your responsibility does not have to be burden on you. It can empower you.
"If you do it right, once you leave and become a journalist it can be an accelerant," Coates said to the crowd. "If you're writing like, 'no I'm trying to change the world,' it's a different type of fire."
The crowd cheered and encouraged the panel throughout the night. Many people who attended the event were there for different reasons.
Mikala Williams, 28, who lives in D.C., said she follows Hannah-Jones and Cobb online.
"I just admire their work," Williams said. "I'm a freelance writer and I wanted to hear what they have to say about being a new writer and always having the audacity to really employ an authentic voice as a Black writer in predominantly White publications and how we can connect that bridge."
When asked about the importance seeing Black representation in the field of journalism, especially at the caliber of the panelists, Williams said, "It's huge. It's almost imperative for young writers or just aspiring writers, especially Black young women and men who are trying to find their footing, where they are in a world where they are reminded that their voice doesn't matter, to continue to fight that, to fight against that. It's just encouraging."
Nichelle Hernandez, 19, a sophomore studying journalism at Howard said, "I want to further the conversation and see what else they have to say about current issues in journalism and issues across the board."
As for pursuing journalism in this climate of layoffs and uncertainty, Hernandez said, "even though journalism may not be the direct avenue I might take, I feel it's still something I should study, and at least as a foundation. Even if I go into production, TV, i feel knowing news, current event writing, that's a good background."

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

Mainers are old, but still doing things 'most people half their age don't do'

Autor: Bennett, Troy R.

Texto completo: Maine people are the oldest folks in the country. There's more oldsters here, relatively speaking, than any other state in the union. That fact is usually seen as an economic and health care conundrum to be solved. But for one Maine man, it's a photographic opportunity and something to celebrate.
About a year ago, Orono photographer Jason Paige Smith started his "The Oldest State" project. Since then, he has made more than a dozen monumental portraits of seniors around the state. Each intricately crafted photograph is coupled with a paragraph or two about the subject. Most of his subjects are still active. All look happy with who -- and where -- they are.
All the photos can be seen on Smith's website, and a few are hanging at the Gracie Theatre at Husson University in Bangor.
[image id="2777744" size="full" pos="center" /]
Smith hasn't had any trouble finding subjects for his pictures. According to the U.S. Census Bureau and its 2017 American Community Survey, the median Maine age is 44.6. The country's national median age is 38. That standing is not new; Maine has been named the oldest state many years in a row.
Smith, 41, grew up in Florida. He's a journalist by schooling and spent time living Colorado. Smith and his family moved to Orono a decade ago. His photo clients include The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Walmart, Down East magazine, WEX Inc., and Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center.
[image id="2777748" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: Why photograph old people?
A: When I moved up here and I didn't think much about the median age being older than the rest of the country. But the longer you live here, the more you hear people talk about it. Every time I'd go out on an assignment -- you know, traveling around the state -- I'd get to [meet and] appreciate the older people who are here. I think they really say a lot about the state, they kind of make up what the state is, as a whole.
Q: Are they more interesting than younger people?
A: I wouldn't say that, but they certainly have a much longer life's story to tell. They've got some decades of experience under their belts. I'm sure there are a lot of really interesting younger people here as well, and I've met several of them. But there's something about the fact that these people are still doing these things. Some of the things they're doing, most people half their age don't do them. I guess it motivates me to get out there and do more.
[image id="2777745" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: How do you find these folks? How do you choose them?
A: That's been interesting. When I started the project, I had a short list of people from different walks of life. I wanted to include as much diversity as I could and approach it from different angles. The first person I photographed was a lobsterman. When I posted it on Facebook, a lot of people reacted to it and I started getting all these messages about other people [who would be good subjects]. So it turned into this cool, kind of organic process, where I would post a picture and then I'd get all these interesting referrals -- and it's people I never would have thought of, real surprises.
Q: Is it hard to convince people to get in front of your camera?
A: There's been a few people who weren't interested, but, for the most part, people have a lot of fun with it. And it's nice to work with them. They usually have a little more time on their hands to do something like this. It's an interesting process to show up with all my gear and talk through things. I just photographed a guy in Newcastle and I set up in his living room. It's a great opportunity to talk to them while I'm setting everything up. It's fun to see them go back and talk about [old times]. I think it does bring back a lot of memories.
[image id="2777746" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: I love the captions on these photos. I appreciate a photographer who isn't afraid to write a little. I think photos say a lot, all at once, but they often don't say anything definitive, or specific. You need words for the fine details.
A: Yeah, that's the journalist in me coming out. I feel like it would be doing my subjects a disservice not to include [the captions]. I think there's more going on than you can put in the pictures.
[image id="2777747" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: Where are you going with this project?
A: That's the million-dollar question. Everyone wants it to be a book, which I think would be fantastic. But, of course, I'd have to figure out a way to fund a thing like that. I don't know how, exactly, it will play out. It's been pretty interesting on its own, online, but I'd love to see a printed edition of it somehow, somewhere -- and a lot of the people I've photographed don't use the internet. So, I always send them a print just to show them how it all turned out.
Q: For now, you're going to just keep on shooting?
A: There's enough stories to tell out there that I could do one of these a week, forever.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING - Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut this week with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle.
Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well.
Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

Texto completo: ROBYN AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (Friday, 7 p.m.) "I was like, I'm not going to write one single sad love song," this Swedish pop singer (below) told The New York Times of her latest album, "Honey." "And then when I started writing, it was sad love song, sad love song, sad love song. But it's in a different way." Robyn has spent over two decades turning those sad love songs into nightclub gold, in iterations that have made her not only a Billboard hit maker, with "Show Me Love" and "Do You Know (What It Takes)," but also a cult favorite ("Call Your Girlfriend" and "Dancing on My Own").

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
AMOUR OR LESS: A BLIER BUFFET at the Quad Cinema (through March 21). Imagine "A Clockwork Orange" as a screwball comedy, and you would be pretty close to Bertrand Blier's "Going Places" (on Friday, Tuesday, Thursday and March 16), which stars Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere as thugs who drift across France stealing money and cars and assaulting women, usually without consequence. Was Blier celebrating their behavior? Critics disagreed. Pauline Kael called the film an "explosively funny erotic farce," while Roger Ebert said it was "the most misogynistic movie I can remember." In the Quad's career-reviving Blier series, "Buffet Froid" (on Friday, Sunday, Tuesday and March 21), first shown in 1979, holds up better. A pitch-black comedy that borrows heavily from Luis Buñuel and Albert Camus and perhaps looks forward to "After Hours," the movie casts Depardieu as an unemployed man who may or may not have knifed an accountant in the subway, a murder that -- like all the others in this movie -- is treated as no big deal by his neighbor, a police inspector (the director's father, Bernard Blier). "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs," which won Blier an Oscar in 1979, will get a full run beginning on March 15.

CANADA NOW 2019 at IFC Center (through March 10). This annual sampling of movies from our neighbor to the north always reflects the diversity of Canadian cinema. "Edge of the Knife," screening on Saturday, is set in 19th-century British Columbia and is said to be Canada's first Haida-language feature, with an all-Haida cast reviving two near-lost indigenous dialects for the film. Other titles such as the documentary "Hugh Hefner's After Dark: Speaking Out in America" (on Friday), about two TV shows the Chicago-born Playboy magnate spearheaded, are Canadian productions in disguise.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'EMPIRE' at the Whitney Museum (March 9, 1 p.m.). In a cinematic career known for offscreen intimations of oral sex ("Blow Job") and movies with Edie Sedgwick in her undergarments ("Poor Little Rich Girl," "Beauty #2"), Andy Warhol made what is perhaps his most notorious film in "Empire" -- which simply captured Empire State Building from shortly after 8 p.m. until nearly 3 a.m. one night in July 1964. (Jonas Mekas, who died in January, was part of the small crew who helped film the movie from the 41st floor of the Time & Life Building.) "Empire" treats time itself as a variable: According to the Museum of Modern Art, when projected, the film is meant to be slowed down so that it runs slightly more than eight hours. The Whitney is screening "Empire" this Saturday as part of its exhibition "Andy Warhol -- From A to B and Back Again," which includes a large sampling of Warhol's moving-image output.

'GIRL 6' at Alamo Drafthouse (March 11, 7 p.m.). This 1996 feature from Spike Lee, with a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows a struggling actress (Theresa Randle) who takes work as a phone sex operator. Currently unavailable to stream, the film was not one of the director's biggest hits critically or commercially, but even mixed reviews suggest it has its upsides. "Bold colors, a dance track of Prince songs, a parade of wild costumes, good-humored sexual teasing and warmly inviting cinematography by Malik Sayeed all contribute to this comedy's high-energy party mood," Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.

SEE IT BIG! COSTUMES BY EDITH HEAD at the Museum of the Moving Image (through March 10). The museum's retrospective on the legendary costume designer closes with a weekend of Hitchcock. Grace Kelly and Cary Grant don their best (and Grant, his cat-burglar suit) on the French Riviera for "To Catch a Thief" (on Friday), while Tippi Hedren is impeccably well dressed for both the avian attacks in "The Birds" (on Saturday and Sunday) and for safecracking in "Marnie" (on Saturday and Sunday), in which Head's tailoring is just one element of the sophisticated color scheme in Hitchcock's depiction of repressed trauma.

THAT FREE GAME APP WANTS YOUR KIDS TO BUY ITS WAY INTO YOUR WALLET

Texto completo: When TechMan was just a TechBoy, he was lured by Saturday morning TV kids' shows to want Roy Rogers lunchboxes and magic decoder rings and tempted by the back pages of comic books to buy cheap plastic toys or bags of worthless canceled stamps.
Targeting children goes way back and has not gone away. It has just changed with technology. Now there are in-app purchases, bait games, data collection and social media. The aim is the same - to get to your wallet or your data through your children.
The Federal Trade Commission a week ago announced a record $5.7 million settlement with musical.ly, a video social network now known as TikTok, over accusations that the app illegally collected personal information about children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires online services to get parents' permission before collecting personal data of users under 13.
The FTC said the app did not do that and, when asked by some parents to delete videos and other data, the site refused, reported The New York Times.
More than a dozen children's advocacy groups called on the FTC to investigate Facebook after reports that the company deceived children into racking up fees from games on its social network using their parents' credit cards.
According to a recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, a teenager spent $6,500 on Facebook games over two weeks and Facebook refused to refund the money. Some Facebook employees internally referred to these children as "whales," a term typically used by casinos to describe high rollers.
Children could spend hundreds of dollars a day on in-game features - arming their characters with flaming swords or new magic spells to defeat an enemy -even if they didn't realize they were spending money until the credit card bill arrived, reported Reveal.com, the reporting center's site.
The report follows actions by the FTC five years ago that required Apple and Google to issue millions of dollars in refunds to parents whose children made unauthorized in-app charges, using so-called "bait apps" downloaded from the companies' app stores. In 2017, the FTC made a similar arrangement with Amazon.
If you explore an app store, you will see most free apps have the designation "in-app purchases," or iap, for things you can buy from within the app for use in the app.
In some apps, the free version is virtually useless unless you buy add-ons. Others require you to buy an auto-renewing subscription to continue viewing video or to subscribe to a more advanced level to add needed functions.
Most app stores have ways to prevent your kids from making iaps, but you'll need to research them.
On the net, not only do you have to protect your own private data and resist expensive come-ons, you have to look out for your kids, too.

Texto completo: En una entrevista con ABC News, Ivanka Trump afirmó que su padre, el presidente Donald Trump , no tuvo nada que ver con la autorización de seguridad y la de su esposo, Jared Kushner .
“Hay información anónima de que mi padre presionó, pero el presidente no ha estado involucrado sobre mi autorización de seguridad” , afirmó a la televisora la llamada Primera Hija.
Sin embargo, reportes de CNN señalan que el presidente Trump presionó a su entonces jefe de personal, John Kelly, y al abogado de la Casa Blanca, Don McGahn , para que concediera a su hija la autorización, según tres personas familiarizadas con el asunto.
Aunque el mandatario tiene la autoridad legal para otorgar las autorizaciones, la mayoría de los casos se dejan en manos de la oficina de seguridad del personal de la Casa Blanca.
El proceso tiene que pasar primero por el FBI, que deberá verificar los antecedentes de los funcionarios de distintos niveles.
Segrún el reporte de CNN, el presidente Trump presionó a Kelly y McGahn para que dieran la autorización correspondiente, pero eso no ocurrió y él las autorizó.
La historia de la televisora da seguimiento a lo revelado por New York Times sobre la presión del presidente Trump a Kelly, para conceder a Kushner una autorización de seguridad de alto secreto, a pesar de las preocupaciones planteadas por los funcionarios de inteligencia.

F.D.A. Warns of Asbestos in Cosmetics Sold by Claire's

Texto completo: The Food and Drug Administration warned on Tuesday that it had found asbestos in cosmetics sold by Claire's, a retailer that markets jewelry and makeup to teenagers, and urged consumers not to use the products.
Consumer claims of asbestos, a known carcinogen, in some Claire's cosmetics were reported in 2017. The company withdrew products from store shelves but did not recall them.
The F.D.A., which received its test results in February, said Claire's refused to recall the products. The agency issued a safety alert urging consumers not to use certain eye shadows, compact powders and contour palettes.
The regulator's test results "show significant errors," Claire's said in a statement, adding that the items identified by the F.D.A. had been "extensively tested by multiple independent accredited laboratories" in early 2018 and were found to follow safety regulations.
"Out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the three products identified by the F.D.A. from our stores, and are also removing any remaining talc-based cosmetic products," said Melanie Berry, a spokeswoman for the company. "There is no evidence that any products sold by Claire's are unsafe."
The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last March and emerged in October after shedding $1.9 billion of debt.
On Tuesday, the F.D.A.'s departing commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, criticized the "outdated" way the agency regulated cosmetics safety. The regulator is hemmed in by "limitations on our cosmetic oversight authority," Dr. Gottlieb said in a joint statement with Susan Mayne, the director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
The agency is not, for example, allowed to force Claire's to recall the contaminated products.
The legislation that determines the extent of the F.D.A.'s authority, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, has not been updated since it was enacted in 1938, Dr. Gottlieb said. The agency relies on the cosmetics industry to police itself.
The F.D.A. called on the industry to be more forthcoming about its safety procedures, especially in relation to how it sources and tests talc. The agency said it had used the most sensitive methods available to test 34 cosmetic products from four talc suppliers in 2010 and found no traces of asbestos.
Asbestos can contaminate talc because the minerals are often intermingled in mines. It is "one of the deadliest substances in existence," Scott Faber, the senior vice president for government affairs for the Environmental Working Group advocacy group, said in a statement.
The New York Times and Reuters reported late last year that Johnson & Johnson had known for decades about the risk of asbestos contamination in its popular baby powder and other talc-based body powders, but tried to keep negative information from reaching the public. The company received subpoenas for more information last month from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
Last month, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said they hoped to overhaul cosmetics legislation this year.
"To modernize our overall approach, we need to expand the scope of what we're able to do commensurate with the scope of the cosmetics industry, and we're going to seek a broader dialogue on how we can make the overall system more robust," Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Mayne said in their statement.

Texto completo: Michael J. Fox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991, underwent spinal surgery last year to correct a recent health scare that led to his falling down "a lot."
Fox, speaking to The New York Times Magazine, addressed his new health issues. He admitted that after the surgery, he tried to rush the recovery process and ended up falling again and breaking his arm.
"I was having this recurring problem with my spinal cord," the 57-year-old actor told the publication. "I was told it was benign but if it stayed static, I would have diminished feeling in my legs and difficulty moving. Then all of a sudden I started falling a lot. It was getting ridiculous. I was trying to parse what was the Parkinson's and what was the spinal thing. But it came to the point where it was probably necessary to have surgery."
The surgery in April was followed by "an intense amount of physical therapy."
"I did it all," he said, "and eventually people asked me to do some acting. Last August I was supposed to go to work. I woke up, walked into the kitchen to get breakfast, misstepped and I went down. I fractured the hell out of my arm. I ended up getting 19 pins and a plate. It was such a blow."
Fox said he might have pushed himself too hard. "In my case, what was it that made me skip down the hallway to the kitchen thinking I was fine when I'd been in a wheelchair six months earlier? It's because I had certain optimistic expectations of myself, and I'd had results to bear out those expectations, but I'd had failures, too. And I hadn't given the failures equal weight," he said.
Fox didn't reveal he had Parkinson's until 1998, seven years after the initial diagnosis. The "Back to the Future" and "Family Ties" star continued to act during that time. In 2000, he founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has since raised $800 million to fund its work.
"I still believe in a cure," he said.

Bigger, Saltier, Heavier: Fast Food Since 1986

Texto completo: Fast-food chains have tried for years to woo health-conscious diners by mixing lighter fare like salads and yogurt with the usual burgers, fried chicken and shakes.
But as menus swelled over the past three decades with grilled chicken wraps (McDonald’s) and “fresco” burritos (Taco Bell), many options grew in size and the calories and sodium in them surged, according to new study from researchers at Boston University and Tufts.
The researchers studied 1,787 entrees, sides and desserts at 10 chains - Arby’s, Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Dairy Queen, Hardee’s, Jack in the Box, KFC, Long John Silver’s, McDonald’s and Wendy’s - from 1986 to 2016. In that time, the number of items in those three categories rose 226 percent.
According to the study - published last week in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics - even with lighter items in the mix, fast-food menus are less healthy than they were 30 years ago.
Entrees: Bulging portions
at the heart of the meal
The fat and salt content and the sheer size of fast food meals have long been a public health concern. They are often blamed for pushing up the obesity rate among adults in the United States, which rose to 40 percent in 2016 from 13 percent in the early 1960s.
The new study suggests the problem is getting worse.
Across the 10 chains, the researchers found, the average entree weighed 39 grams more in 2016 than in 1986 and had 90 more calories. It also had 41.6 percent of the recommended daily allotment of sodium, up from 27.8 percent.
Customers could be forgiven for not knowing. Local governments have adopted menu-labeling initiatives that require fast-food restaurants to list calorie counts for the items they sell, but such measures have faced substantial opposition, including from the Food and Drug Administration.
“The restaurants really haven’t done enough,” Megan A. McCrory, the lead researcher, said. “The big picture is that there have been some positive changes, but they’re small, and overall, the changes have gotten worse.”
Desserts: More than just
a little something sweet
In 2016, the average fast-food dessert weighed an extra 71 grams and had 186 more calories than the average dessert 30 years earlier, the researchers found.
One possible reason is that restaurants are counting on bigger sundaes and cookies as a way of increasing the amount spent on each order and attracting more customers, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD.
“The majority of fast-food traffic is around lunchtime, when people aren’t typically getting dessert,” he said. “But offering larger portion sizes is one way restaurants can promise more value.”
Just last month, McDonald’s introduced “doughnut sticks” dusted with cinnamon sugar. Six sticks have 280 calories. But you can also order a serving twice the size for less than the cost of two single orders.
Sides: Pass the pepper,
but maybe hold onto the salt
The researchers found that there were 42 more calories on average in items like chips, soups and French fries in 2016 than there were in 1986. Sodium content rose to 23.2 percent of the recommended daily allotment from 11.6 percent, even though portion size did not grow substantially.
Consumed together as a single meal, the study found, the average entree and side account for nearly 40 percent of a 2,000-calorie daily diet.
The study mentions several proposals meant to help consumers scale back their fast-food intake, including a system that would let them order smaller portions at lower prices.
Whether the industry will embrace such ideas is unclear. In the meantime, menus continue to grow, sometimes blurring the line between entree and side. Jack in the Box is testing Burger Dippers, which the company describes as “the burger you eat like a fry.”
As with those that preceded them, some of the new offerings appear to be geared toward people who want to eat healthy foods. Carl’s Jr. recently added a plant-based burger to its lineup.
Ordered with cheese, it has more than 700 calories.

Texto completo: IndyStar was again recognized as one of the nation's top Sports sections, earning 10 honors in the Associated Press Sports Editors contest.
IndyStar earned its third consecutive triple crown, placing in the top 10 in the second-largest classification for daily section, Sunday section and website. IndyStar is one of eight publications to accomplish that feat each of the past three years, joining the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Seattle Times, Washington Post, Oklahoman, Boston Globe and Tuscaloosa News.
Zak Keefer, Matt Kryger and Mykal McEldowney each earned two top 10s. Keefer was honored in features for He's nearly blind. He's flat broke. But he carries Olympic gold in his pocket; a feature on Sugar Ray Seales, who now teaches boxing in Indianapolis, and beat writing, for a collection of stories on the Colts. Kryger was honored in action and feature photos. McEldowney earned two top 10s in videos.
Marisa Kwiatkowski and Zach Osterman shared a breaking news top 10 for their reporting on the suspension of Indiana University running back Morgan Ellison.
Kwiatkowski and Tim Evans also contributed to a Detroit Free Press story, How Larry Nassar abused hundreds of gymnasts and eluded justice for decades, which won an explanatory award in the largest classification.
Nathan Baird, who covers Purdue for the Lafayette Journal & Courier and IndyStar, won a national-best seven Top 10s: beat writing, breaking news (twice, once with Ron Wilkins), columns, explanatory, features and game story.

Texto completo: LOUMBILA, Burkina Faso - President Donald Trump has ordered most American troops to withdraw from Syria. He wants to bring home thousands more from Afghanistan. Now hundreds of U.S. commandos and other forces are leaving West Africa - despite an onslaught of attacks from an increasingly deadly matrix of Islamist fighters.
The shift has unnerved African commanders in Burkina Faso and neighboring nations in the Sahel, a vast sub-Saharan scrubland increasingly racked by bombings, massacres, kidnappings and attacks on hotels frequented by Westerners. It is a region in which most Americans were unaware of U.S. military involvement until four Army solders were killed in a deadly 2017 Embush in Niger by Islamic State fighters.
What is emerging, critics said, is a glimpse of what happens when U.S. troops, especially Special Operations forces, pull back before insurgents are effectively subdued, leaving local or allied forces to fend off the Islamic State, al-Qaida or their offshoots.
"It's a real problem," Col. Maj. Moussa Salaou Barmou, commander of Niger's Special Operations forces, said of the drawdown and the closing of seven of eight U.S. elite counterter-torism units operating in Africa.
Under the Trump administration's military strategy, the Pentagon has pivoted from focusing on counterter-torism operations to potential threats irom China and Russia.
The U.S. military is scaling back its commandos in Africa by about 25 percent, mainly in the continent's west. At the same time, insurgents are attacking northern Burkina Faso and pushing south along the border with Niger toward areas previously untouched by extremist violence, including the Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and Ghana, where the Pentagon has a logistics hub.
In one sign of the growing fear, a school in the Burkina Faso village of Bargo recently built a concrete wall around its buildings for greater protection. Just last month, two boys were kidnapped by extremists while they prayed at the nearby mosque, said Bonane Honore, the school's headmaster.
"We are very scared," said Christine Kabore Ouedraogo, a political leader in the village, a short drive from the training camp in Loumbila.
"The threat is gaining ground," Foreign Minister Alpha Barry of Burkina Faso told a security conference in Munich in February. "It's no longer just the Sahel, it's coastal West Africa and the risk of spreading regionally."
France, the former colonial power in West Africa, maintains 4,500 troops in the region to help battle insurgents in Niger, Chad and Mali, where it routed al-Qaida's affiliate from the north in 2013. French officials said the Pentagon had assured them it would keep providing intelligence, logistics and aerial refueling in what Prime Minister édouard Philippe called "a hard fight," while visiting troops in Mali last week.
The U.S. military has a relatively light footprint across Africa relying on European and African partners to carry out most countertenorlsm missions from the Sahel to Somalia, with the Pentagon providing air power when needed. The United States has already conducted 23 air-strikes this year against al-Shabab targets in Somalia, compared with 47 all of 2018.
About 6,000 US. troops and 1,000 Defense Department civilians or contractors work throughout Africa, mainly training and conducting exercises with local forces.
The military's Africa Command plans to cut 10 percent of those personnel by January 2022, including about 300 Special Operations forces from the roughly 1,200 commandos who were deployed across the continent last year.

Texto completo: Kathleen Peddicord frequently hears from such skeptics as founder of Live and Invest Overseas, a site for people curious about living abroad. Actual expats like her, however, tell of good-quality care at a fraction of the U.S. price. Treatment for a motorbike accident in Panama cost her $20. Emergency dental surgery that might cost $10,000 or more in the U.S. was $4,500 in Paris. In many countries, medications that would require a prescription in the States are available directly from licensed pharmacies at low prices, thanks to government subsidies or regulation.
“The health care in a lot of places around the world is very good, as good as in the United States,” says Peddicord, who currently divides her time between Paris and Panama. “Some places, it is better.”
Low-cost, quality health care usually isn’t the main reason people move abroad, says expat and Mexico resident Don Murray, who writes for rival site International Living. But reduced medical expenses are part of the lower living costs that prompt many Americans to relocate, he says.
Expat numbers on the rise
About 9 million Americans who aren’t in the military live outside the U.S., according to State Department estimates. That’s increased considerably from its 1999 estimate of 3 million to 6 million. The number could rise in coming years as millions more Americans barrel toward retirement without enough income to maintain their standard of living at home.
Health care is a particular concern for Americans who want to retire before age 65, when Medicare, the government health program for seniors, kicks in. Currently, early retirees can buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but it’s not always truly affordable and its future is uncertain.
Some who would otherwise retire plan to keep working, rather than risk being uninsured. But a move abroad could be an option for those intrepid enough to try it.
Cheaper health care also may appeal to gig economy workers who aren’t tied to stateside jobs. Freelance science writer Erica Rex, for example, recently wrote an opinion column for The New York Times about moving to the United Kingdom and then France after her 2009 cancer diagnosis. “Moving to Europe was a choice weighed against other, grimmer options for health care, which included the strong possibility of being bankrupted by cancer treatment and winding up at the mercy of New York State’s welfare system,” she wrote.
Quality varies by destination
Not all expat havens have great health care systems. Belize, for example, encourages immigration by exempting retirees from most income taxes — but many expats there cross the border to Mexico for health care, Peddicord says.
France, on the other hand, is known for its excellent health care system. International Living and Live and Invest Overseas give the country top marks, along with Mexico, Ecuador and Malaysia. International Living praises Thailand and Costa Rica as well, while Live and Invest Overseas says Portugal, Italy and Malta have admirable health care.
With any country, quality can vary — especially in sparsely populated areas. Murray and his wife, Diane, left their first retirement destination, a small town in Ecuador, after encountering broken equipment and few doctors. They’re much happier with the care near their Yucatan Peninsula home, where next-day appointments are the norm and doctors are typically trained in the U.S. or Europe, he says.
“It’s like in the U.S. — if you live in Possum Belly, Alabama, and they don’t have a hospital and the nearest one is an hour and a half away, the health care isn’t going to be the same” as in a major city, Murray says.
Options for health care access
Expats may be able to qualify for a country’s public health care system if they become residents. Otherwise, there’s typically a private system in which people can pay out of pocket and get reimbursed if they have private health insurance.
Peddicord and her husband, Lief Simon, who are in their 50s, have an international health insurance policy that covers them whether they’re traveling or at home in France or Panama. The annual cost is about $3,000 for both of them, she says. Murray, 69, says he and his wife pay about $80 each month for Mexico’s public health system, but use private doctors and pay out of pocket for most care (including $8 for a recent hospital visit to treat an eye infection).
“My personal budget no longer contains a line for health care expenses,” Murray says. “They are so inconsequential there is no need.”

Texto completo: Nationally recognized creative director Chris Birt has written a book about generating brand awareness without much advertising.
The CEO of ABdBUZZ, with offices in Minneapolis and Denver, has been in advertising 20 years, during which time he has courted controversy and helped brands expand. A Sharper Image ad of his that ran in Paper magazine landed a New York Times story. In that ad, Amanda Lepore stands seductively near a New York City subway entrance, next to an air purifier. "Clean up the air but don't touch the freaks," reads the tagline. Birt's very proud of how forward-thinking that ad was: "I was friggin' featuring transgender people in ads before it was trendy!"
Another of his faves was the "This Is Your Wake-up Call" print and TV campaign for caffeinated Wide-Eye Schnapps. One spot captured parents waking up their kid with the sound of a chain saw. "Lynne Rossetto Kasper, retired host of NPR's 'The Splendid Table,' called it the most demented product of 2014!" Birt said, laughing with delight. See more ads at abdbuzz.com.
Q: What inspired you to write a book?
A: I've long believed that advertising is about talk value, yet brands don't really get that. If you create advertising that has talk value, you don't have to pay the media companies to run it for you. My brand of work, my whole career, is based on creating advertising that people talk about. You've covered ... a campaign I had [for a local brewery] with a fake Italian model, Lorenzo Lucid. Women made marriage proposals to him. I finally had to blow his cover.
I had another ad you covered when the Minnesota Lynx were getting going. This is back when they had about 1,000 people in the stands. Oops, wait, I suppose I shouldn't say that ... My whole idea was that women can play a fierce game of basketball. So I created an ad where I compared Seimone Augustus to Michael Jordan by saying, "Think Michael Jordan post-op." I did get in trouble for that, but the ticket sells went up, the walk-up traffic went up 41 percent. It's whatever you can do to get the message out.
Q: A piece of advice for someone who wants more media attention?
A: Instead of thinking about what makes your product different, think in terms of how you can fit your message into a conversation already being had out there. This Gillette ad, with the toxic masculinity, now every time I shave I'm saving a woman's bottom from being patted ... When brand has buzz that's advertising that's free ... When you strike a nerve with something like that, people talk about it.
Q: That was a good message Gillette decide to piggyback on, so I was surprised there was any criticism of it.
A: [Laugh] People think advertising is about products and whatnot. No, no, no. Advertising is about the zeitgeist. It's literally about social issues, the conversation that's happening out there. Politics are a quintessential example of what I'm talking about. There are people on the right, on the left, people who are closed-minded, people who are open-minded. I'm sure they [Gillette] anticipated blowback.
Q: Blowback creates buzz?
A: It does ... I was at a Silicon Valley conference a few months ago where [someone said] the internet is nothing but a giant conversation. Your goal as a brand or company is to become part of that conversation. That's where I get the idea for my campaigns. That validated everything I have been saying for the past 15 years, and that's, I think, when people in Minnesota started listening to me.
Sometimes brands here locally have been a little reticent to push the envelope of doing buzzy work because they are afraid there might be blowback. My thinking is the risk is that nobody talks about you. There is a new trend in the media now they are calling "brand bravery." It doesn't always have to be a social position. I did a campaign for the Minneapolis Public Library which helped them raise like tons of money. I said, "You've got to tap into the fact that librarians are actually kind of sexy." That's probably kind of sexist to say that.
Q: It's not sexist if you say both the men and the women are sexy.
A: They both are ... I talked about all the people who were librarians and that they were change-makers.
Q: What do you think of the concept of "influencers"?
A: Influencers are a fad. Everyone knows the deal is quid pro quo. If everyone can be an influencer, then no one has real influence.

Could Amazon reconsider NYC plans?

Texto completo: ALBANY – Gov. Andrew Cuomo and supporters of bringing an Amazon headquarters to New York City have bolstered their efforts in recent days to try to get the online retail giant to reconsider the decision to drop its plans for the city.
Cuomo has talked with Amazon officials to try to get the Seattle-based company to come back to Long Island City in Queens after it pulled out of the deal Feb. 14 amid local opposition.
But he said the company has not suggested it has been swayed.
"They have given no indication that they would reconsider," Cuomo said Friday on WNYC, a public-radio station in Manhattan
"So I think the point was more not that Amazon is going to change it's mind. I don't think that they do. But the truth should be known. Because this was a national story, and it had damning consequences for New York."
Cuomo's pursuit of Amazon was coupled Thursday with an open letter to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos from more than 70 business groups, politicians and unions imploring him to reconsider the decision to dump its plans for a headquarters in the city that promised at least 25,000 jobs.
"New York attracts the best, most diverse talent from across the globe," the letter said.
"We are a dynamic new center of the country's most inclusive tech economy. We all hope you reconsider and join us in building the exciting future of New York."
Can it work? Cuomo has been working behind the scenes with Amazon officials, including Bezos, to try to salvage the deal, the New York Times reported Thursday.
So far, though, it appears Amazon hasn't budged. The company declined comment Friday.
While some unions signed onto the letter, other unions and some local political leaders still remain opposed to the Amazon deal.
They have criticized the $3 billion that New York City and the state pledged to the company and worrying about the impact on local housing prices and services if Amazon were to move in.
And some state senators took exemption to Cuomo's pledge to Amazon that he would make sure that if Amazon returns, he would personally shepherd the deal with the state bureaucracy.
"'The Governor will take over the process.'" Smh, what a tyrant," Sen. Julia Salazar, D-Queens, wrote on Twitter.
But Cuomo said Friday he's trying to salvage the deal and also let businesses know that New York is welcoming.
"We want all businesses nationwide to know that this was an oddity," he said.
"Don't think that if you come to New York, the same thing is going to happen that happened to Amazon. That was a small, vocal minority that was local, petty politics that governed the day. And we don't operate that way."
Cuomo's pledge The letter and a statement from Cuomo's spokeswoman indicated he would be more directly involved if Amazon were to revive its plans for the city.
"Governor Cuomo will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval and Mayor de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development process," the letter said.
Cuomo's spokeswoman Dani Lever put the blame on Senate Democrats for their opposition to Amazon, particularly Queens Sen. Mike Gianaris.
"The State Senate made a terrible blunder — everyone, including their members, knows it — and 70% of New Yorkers affirmed it," Lever said.
"The governor will take over the process and can comfortably assure Amazon the approval will get done."
Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, indicated Thursday night the Senate would be receptive to talking again with Amazon.
""I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision and hoped they would reconsider," she said in a statement.
"I have also repeatedly indicated my willingness to work with Amazon in the best interests of our state and affected communities. It is clear that this process exposed serious flaws in our economic development programs that need to be reformed for future projects."

Evidence Found of Attack With Chemicals in Syria

Texto completo: The authority that polices the treaty banning chemical arms said Friday it had found "reasonable grounds" that chlorine weapons were deployed in a fatal assault on a rebel Syrian town last year.
A report by inspectors from the authority, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, is the most definitive finding yet to corroborate allegations that chemical weapons were dropped on the town, Douma, a suburb of Damascus, killing 43 people on April 7, 2018.
The United States and its allies have blamed President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Mr. al-Assad and his principal ally, Russia, rejected the accusations and suggested the attack had been carried out by the rebels themselves or may have even been a hoax.
Chemical weapons use, a war crime, has become a recurrent theme in the eight-year-old conflict in Syria.
The Douma attack came a year after a chemical arms assault on the northern rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun killed around 100 people, a strike that the West also attributed to Mr. al-Assad, who denied the accusations.
President Trump ordered a missile assault on a Syrian military airfield after the Khan Sheikhoun attack in what he described as a punishment and a warning to Mr. Assad. After the Douma attack, the United States, Britain and France all launched punitive airstrikes against Syrian government targets.
The Syrian authorities initially barred inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons from the Douma site, fueling Western suspicions of a cover-up.
The inspectors were eventually able to visit, interview witnesses, examine a warehouse and collect and analyze samples. They were not able to examine any bodies of victims, who had been buried by the time they were able to enter Douma.
Nonetheless, the cumulative evidence, presented in the report released by the organization, provided "reasonable grounds that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon took place. This toxic chemical contained reactive chlorine. The toxic chemical was likely molecular chlorine."
[Watch The New York Times's visual investigation into the Douma chemical attack.]
The organization, based in The Hague, is responsible for adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, a treaty that bans the use of any toxins to kill or injure, including chlorine, a common industrial chemical that can be fatally toxic. Chlorine's first use as a weapon dates to World War I.
Mr. al-Assad's government signed the treaty in 2013 and agreed to eliminate the chemical arms stockpiles it had declared, under the supervision of the organization and the United Nations.
But dozens of cases have been confirmed in the years since, raising suspicions among Mr. al-Assad's adversaries that he did not destroy his entire arsenal.
In 2016, a joint team of the organization and United Nations found that the Syrian government had repeatedly dropped chlorine bombs on civilians, and that the Islamic State had used sulfur mustard.
In 2017, the team documented the Syrian government's use of the nerve agent sarin in the Khan Sheikhoun assault. Syria and Russia called the conclusions fabricated.
At the time of the attack on Douma, it was held by rebels fighting Mr. Assad's forces, which controlled the airspace over the town. Damage on a bomb casing found in Douma showed evidence it had been dropped from an aircraft, and black residue suggested a chemical reaction of chlorine.
The Douma report does not assign blame, which was outside the mandate of the team sent to investigate. Last June, however, the organization's members decided to begin investigating and attributing responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria.
Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director for Human Rights Watch, said the finding on Douma "adds one more case to the scores of illegal chemical weapons attacks" that have recurred in Syria.
"It's clear that the O.P.C.W.'s new unit for attributing blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria has its work cut out," Mr. Charbonneau said in a statement.

Bow Wow Film Fest at the Parkway; ‘Cuba’ at the Science Museum

Texto completo: The Bow Wow Film Festival , now in its fourth year, is a mixed doggie bag of 25 shorts. None will win an Oscar, but together they do their job: make you laugh, cry, and say aww, touch your heart and inspire you to adopt a rescue dog, or think about it.
This year’s fest has one showing Saturday at the Parkway, where the first Bow Wow screened in 2015. If you haven’t been to the Parkway in a while, you’re in for a tail-wagging treat. The theater has been tastefully renovated. There’s leg room and a bar serving craft cocktails.
You’ll see dogs on surfboards, dogs in snow, dogs in mountains and dogs in paradise – a lush green sanctuary in Puerto Rico called Territorio de Zaguates, or Land of the Strays. It’s a 1,000-foot enclosure where 900 former street dogs are safe, fed and cared for, thanks to volunteers, donors, and founder Lya Battle.
In Taiwan, engineer Pa Chieh makes affordable wheelchairs for disabled dogs and cats. Most of the animals were hit by cars and left at shelters, where their chances of being adopted were zero. When this film was made, Pa had made 400 wheelchairs. Dogs are seen zooming around in the contraptions, tongues hanging out, happy to be alive.
In Alaska, a young woman named Stacey took in a starving dog that was found by the side of a road. She named it Oberon and posted pictures and videos on the Internet. Swedish filmmaker Carl Fristedt saw them and flew to Alaska to meet her. As in many stories about people rescuing dogs, Oberon also rescued Stacey. She described the experience as “one of those events that happen in your life where you kind of figure out who you are.”
In Tanzania, dogs are being trained to help stop poaching and wildlife trafficking. In Italy, they’re being certified as lifeguard dogs. A dog stays calm in a crisis, can pull several people through water at the same time and instinctively knows the best directions to swim, avoiding dangerous currents.
A few of the films are amateurish, and a few are just strange. But there are lovely surprises in this year’s reel. Like the story of ultramarathon runner Dion Leonard and his dog, Gobi, named for the desert in China where she came out of nowhere and ran beside him for 25 miles. Then, when he wanted to bring her back to Scotland, the Chinese said she had to be quarantined for four months first. And then she was stolen by dog meat thieves! No worries – happy ending. A sweet, skillful animation by 14-year-old Ava Phillips, set to Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” wordlessly shows a friendship between two dogs. Maybe we’ll see her name in the Oscars someday.
The 4th Annual Bow Wow Film Festival will be at the Parkway on Saturday. Doors at 6 p.m., film at 7. FMI and tickets ($13/8 advance, $16/9 door). The festival will benefit Wags and Whiskers Animal Rescue of Minnesota.
The picks
There’s a whole lot of music on Sunday afternoon.
Opens tonight (Friday, March 1) in the Science Museum’s Omnitheater: “Cuba.” See Cuba through the eyes of a historian, a ballerina and a team of scientists. Historic photography and modern-day footage combine in this giant-screen visit to our neighbor to the south. Opening weekend will feature live music, tropical décor, Cuban-themed food and a visit from a 1956 Buick Special. With the closing in January of the IMAX at the Minnesota Zoo, the Omnitheater is now the largest movie screen in Minnesota. FMI including trailer, times and tickets; 651-221-9444.
Today through Sunday: Christian Zacharias Plays Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 27. Zacharias’ recordings of the complete Mozart piano concertos won several prestigious awards, including France’s Diaposon d’Or. The former SPCO artistic partner will play Mozart’s final piano concerto, conducting from the piano, and lead works by Bruckner, Widmann and Beethoven. 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. today at the Ordway Concert Hall, 8 p.m. Saturday at Carleton College in Northfield (in the new Kracum Performance Hall) and 2 p.m. Sunday at the Ted Mann. FMI and tickets (start at $11 for adults, kids and students free; all free at Carleton). The four concerts are lead-ups to a performance by Zaharias and the SPCO next Tuesday, March 5, at the 2019 Casals Festival in Puerto Rico. Those who wish to do so may contribute to hurricane relief on the island through El Fondo Boricua, a donor-advised fund of the Saint Paul Foundation.
Sunday at the Cathedral of St. Paul: Music for a Grand Space. From the University of Minnesota School of Music, a choral concert made for the Cathedral’s grand acoustic, featuring works by Mathias, Monteverdi, Brahms, Abbie Betinis and more. With the University Singers, Chamber Singers, and U of M Men’s and Women’s Choruses. 2:30 p.m. Free and open to the public.
Sunday at Christ Church Lutheran: Mardi Gras: Hot Jazz in a Cool Sacred Space. The Eliel Saarinen-designed church in Longfellow has a brand-new Dobson pipe organ, a mighty instrument and a major investment – nearly three quarters of a million dollars. Obviously, it will be used during services and for solo recitals, but what else can it do? Anyone who heard John Zorn play the organ at St. Mark’s Episcopal in 2013 knows at least one answer to that. Christ Church wants the instrument to be part of the wider Twin Cities musical community. On Sunday, they’ll dip a toe in those waters. With organist Bill Chouinard (brother to Dan, if you’re wondering), trumpeter Bill Simonsen and his Longfellow Jazz All-stars will play an afternoon concert of New Orleans jazz. 3 p.m. Free. Christ Church Lutheran formerly hosted Accordo’s concerts. It’s a beautiful space and this should be fun. A free-will offering will benefit Our Saviour’s community services.
Sunday at Mindekirken: Wilhelmina Smith, Cello. A late-afternoon concert of solo cello by the McKnight Artist Fellow and prizewinner in the Leonard Rose International Cello Competition. Smith will play a program of Finnish and Danish works including Esa-Pekka Salonen’s “knock, breathe, shine,” to be released the following week on her new album on the Ondine label. 4 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20; students free with ID).
Sunday at Adath Jeshurun Congregation in Minnetonka: Ernest Bloch’s “Sacred Service.” Three local choirs, over 90 combined voices, one Minnesota premiere. Bloch’s five-part cantata “Avodat HaKodesh (Sacred Service),” sung entirely in Hebrew, is one of the great choral works of the 20th century – the Hebraic equivalent to the Christian Masses and prayers of Bach, Haydn, Mozart and others. This performance will feature MacPhail’s adult choir Sonomento, the Adath Jeshurun Congregation’s synagogue choir, the Twin Cities’ Jewish Chorale, a 45-piece professional orchestra and Detroit cantor Daniel Gross, with Sonomento director Craig Fields conducting. 4:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($18-54).
Tuesday at the Walker: Insights Design Lecture Series: Forest Young. The 2019 edition of the popular series co-presented by the Walker and AIGA Minnesota kicks off with the head of design at Wolff Olins, the global brand consultancy whose clients include Uber, Google and Microsoft. The series continues March 12 with illustrator Bráulio Amado of BAD Studio, March 19 with fashion and culture guru Mirko Borsche of Bureau Borsche and March 26 with Gail Bichler, deputy art director/design director of the New York Times Magazine. FMI and tickets ($24, $19 Walker and AIGA members, $10 students; series packages available). Each talk is followed by an after-lecture reception with the speaker.

Texto completo: Gov. Cuomo isn't giving up on bringing Amazon to New York.
The governor - while left flat-footed after Jeff Bezos abruptly reversed on his plan to build a new headquarters in Queens - is still determined to lure the multibillion dollar retail giant back to the Big Apple.
Cuomo confirmed at a press conference in Long Island Thursday that he has reached out to Bezos to make the pitch to come back the city.
"I've had many conversations with Amazon. I hope that they reconsider. Up until now, we haven't seen any change in their position. It would be helpful if the state Senate said that they would approve it. That would be helpful, but in the meantime I haven't heard anything new," the governor said.
The efforts included personal calls between the governor and Amazon founder Bezos, according to The New York Times.
An open letter to Bezos posted by the Partnership for New York urged him to change his mind and embrace the nation's largest city.
"A clear majority of New Yorkers support this project and were disappointed by your decision not to proceed," the letter reads.
"As representatives of a wide range of government, business, labor and community interests, we urge you to reconsider so that we can move forward together."
The letter was signed by former Mayor David Dinkins and an assortment of pro-Amazon unions, local businesses and elected officials.
"New York attracts the best, most diverse talent from across the globe," the letter concluded. "We all hope you reconsider and join us in building the exciting future of New York."
Cuomo held several phone conversations with Bezos, who gave no warning before announcing his decision to abandon the Long Island City location for the new Amazon outpost, The Times reported.
Supporters of the proposal note the plan would bring $28 billion in new tax revenues along with 25,000 permanent jobs to the city.
Cuomo's conversations didn't mention a specific new site for the Amazon headquarters, but the letter made it clear that the governor would make sure a second attempt was not torpedoed by critics.
The governor "will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval," read the letter.
State Senate Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins stacked the deck against the deal in February when she nominated Queens Sen. Michael Gianaris, an outspoken opponent, to an obscure board with sign-off authority over a $500 million construction grant for the project.
The online retail giant broke the governor's heart after it pulled the plug on Valentine's Day, after getting resistance from local leaders.
Stewart-Cousins said on Thursday, that she is willing to welcome Bezos back to the city.
"I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision," she said.
Gianaris did not respond to a request for comment.

Pentagon plan could have US troops out of Afghanistan in 3 to 5 years

Texto completo: All U.S. troops could exit Afghanistan within the next half-decade, according to a new report.

A plan under consideration as part of Afghanistan peace negotiations would pull all of the roughly 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan within three to five years, along with other international troops in the region, the New York Times reports. Portions of the plan was shared with the outlet by current and former U.S. and European officials.

The plan would halve the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan in the next few months. With European and Australian troops taking charge of training Afghan forces, remaining U.S. forces would be freed up to focus more attention on counterterrorism strikes.

The plan has been embraced in some circles in Washington and at NATO headquarters, but American officials caution that President Trump could go down a different path. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan recently said allies would be consulted before the U.S. withdraws any troops from Afghanistan.

“There will be no unilateral troop reductions,” Shanahan told reporters earlier this month in Brussels after meeting with NATO defense chiefs. “That was one of the messages: It will be coordinated. We’re together.”

Pentagon representative Lt. Col. Kone Faulkner said nothing is finalized, and the Pentagon is “considering all options of force numbers and disposition.”

U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad is working to secure a peace agreement in Afghanistan and will participate in negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar on Saturday, following up on discussions from earlier in the week. The plan is intended to aid him during these discussions.

A withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan is a top priority for the Taliban, and a possible withdrawal was addressed in a draft framework agreed upon by the United States and the Taliban last month. The draft framework also required the Taliban to bar al Qaeda and the Islamic State from entering Afghanistan and plotting terrorist attacks from the country.

Despite progress in the negotiations, the Afghan government has yet to be included in the discussions due to resistance from the Taliban. Khalilzad and other U.S. officials have stressed the need for the Afghan government to be added to the talks as soon as possible.

In the meantime, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani advised his forces to be prepared for attacks from the Taliban while a peace plan is worked out.

“Peace is not easy; it need courage and bilateral honor,” Ghani said in a speech Thursday.

MADE FOR POLITICS BETO THRIVES IN THE MAKE-BELIEVE

Texto completo: Furious Democrats demand that I stop complaining and learn to love The Beto.
My criticism of a Texas-sized cultural enigma who changes his schtick like other people change cell phone companies has enraged both white liberals and Latino lefties. Beware the Beto Bots.
The white liberals prefer that Mexican-Americans serve up chips and not opinions. And they're miffed that I rejected their choice for the preferred "Latino" 2020 presidential hopeful, after they went to the trouble of choosing him for me.
The Latino lefties have such low self-esteem and deep insecurities that they're flattered that a handsome Irish-American who grew up on the soft side of town and studied in the Ivy League wants to be one of them.
Robert Francis O'Rourke is likely to announce soon that he is joining the 2020 Democratic presidential field.
After leaving Congress and losing a Senate race, Mr. O'Rourke hit the open road in search of America. What he found was that Beto really loves Beto. Which makes him the perfect foil for Donald Trump, who really loves Donald Trump.
I don't feel the love. I think the Texas Democrat is a phony, an opportunist and an underachiever whose thought process is stuck in the shallow end. And what really bothers me is how the media, liberals and the rest of the Beto Bots deify him and demonize critics.
As a Mexican-American who fell in love with the Irish when I went to college and graduate school across the Charles River from Boston, the fact that this Irishman is hellbent on impersonating a Mexican-American -or at least doesn't mind if you think he's one -drives me loco.
Here are 10 reasons why "Beto-mania" bugs me.
* It has always bothered me when Hollywood casts non-Latinos as Latinos. In the film "West Side Story," few of the actors -besides Rita Moreno -were Latino. In a planned remake, producers are making the effort to cast Latinos.
* Mr. O'Rourke talks about the importance of taking courageous stances. But, as The Washington Post pointed out recently after interviewing him, he avoids taking firm positions on controversial issues. That's not courage.
* As a Mexican-American, I've learned not to fluster white people who often get squeamish easily because of demographics. But Mr. O'Rourke can go all radical and talk about knocking down walls on the U.S.-Mexico border.
* When The Post asked about immigration and what to do about visa overstayers, Mr. O'Rourke said: "I don't know." He lives in El Paso, not Des Moines. He can't say: "I don't know." An actual Mexican-American would be toast if he said that.
* Mr. O'Rourke doesn't do homework. He is the Democratic Party's version of Sarah Palin, telegenic and charismatic but afraid to open a book because he thinks it might explode in his face.
* The son of a county commissioner and county judge, the Democrat is now the husband of Amy O'Rourke and the son-in-law of William D. Sanders, a real estate tycoon who has been called a billionaire but who Forbes insists is worth a measly $500 million. With an estimated net worth of $5 to $10 million, Beto never learned accountability. Not even after getting arrested in his 20s for drunk driving and breaking into the University of Texas in El Paso.
* Mr. O'Rourke's father, Pat, was the one who gave him the nickname "Beto." Pat told reporters he thought it would help his son if he entered politics in El Paso. But first, Beto went to Columbia University in New York, where he conveniently reverted to "Robert."
* Beto may be a serious candidate but he does not seem to be a serious person. Everything is a show, a joke, a missed test he didn't study for anyway. What do you expect when you come up short and still fall backward into an interview with Oprah Winfrey?
* Mr. O'Rourke may be the only "Latino" in the country who missed out on racism, so he probably lacks empathy for those who endured it.
* Everyone says Mr. O'Rourke is vying for the Latino vote against Julian Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development who is running for president. But Mr. O'Rourke isn't Latino. They might as well pit him against Sen. Elizabeth Warren for the female vote. I bet Mr. O'Rourke can really rock a pantsuit.
It's not just me. Every day, I hear from other Latinos who -for their own reasons -are not feeling The Beto.
Just in case you're interested. Or do we not get a say in who represents us? If that's true, then, well, good to know.

Texto completo: “Si Maduro no podía aguantar una entrevista de Jorge Ramos, no se debió sentar con él”, afirmó tras llegar a Miami, deportada desde Venezuela, la productora María Martínez-Guzmán, vicepresidenta de Univision Noticias , miembro del grupo retenido el lunes durante una entrevista fallida con Nicolás Maduro en el Palacio de Miraflores.
“Pensábamos que (Maduro) se podría parar” de la entrevista, “pero nunca pensábamos que nos iban a confiscar los equipos. Confiscar no es la palabra. Nos robaron nuestros equipos “, dijo Martínez-Guzmán. “Los que más bruscos estaban, los más toscos, eran cubanos”, afirmó convencida sobre el entorno de Maduro, por ser ella cubano estadounidense.
Maduro interrumpió la entrevista luego de 17 minutos, dijo el mexicano Ramos. “Para frustración de los agentes de seguridad, María (Martínez-Guzmán) se las arregló para hacer una llamada fugaz al presidente de Univisión News, Daniel Coronell, quien a su vez le advirtió al Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos y anunció a muchos medios de comunicación lo que estaba pasando”.
“Si le hacen esto a Jorge Ramos, imagínate lo que les pasa a otros periodistas en Venezuela”, comentó Elyangélica González, corresponsal venezolana de Univision, asilada en Florida.
“Nos apuntaron con una pistola en la cabeza por 30 segundos”, declaró el también periodista mexicano Pedro Ultreras en referencia a otro episodio durante su estadía el fin de semana en la zona fronteriza con Colombia. “Pensamos que nos iban a matar”.
“El gobierno de Maduro se aferra a que el mundo no conozca lo que pasa en ese país”, sentenció Ultreras en referencia a la difícil labor de los periodistas locales y extranjeros en esa nación. “Los colectivos son sicarios del gobierno”, agregó.
Ultreras viajó a Venezuela para cubrir la crisis que atraviesa el país suramericano y allá comenzó a ser perseguido por unos sujetos con perdigones. Según el canal, él no sabía si eran miembros de la Guardia Nacional o colectivos paramilitares fieles a Maduro.
Logró escapar, pero luego enfrentó otro momento de pánico cuando le apuntaron con una pistola. “Era (una situación) muy difícil, para luego llegar a Caracas”, relató en referencia al episodio que vivió el equipo de Ramos el lunes.
Según el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Prensa (SNTP) de Venezuela, en lo que va de año suman “al menos 30 detenciones de periodistas y trabajadores de los medios” en ese país.
El martes, mientras el equipo de Univision era deportado, el corresponsal Daniel Garrido de Telemundo News también fue detenido por agentes de Maduro.
Ramos resumió su experiencia en una columna en español que publicó hoy The New York Times , titulada “El dictador de Venezuela se gana su título”.
“Fui deportado de Venezuela el martes 26 de febrero después de una entrevista tirante con Nicolás Maduro, el mandatario del país. En medio de nuestra conversación se levantó y se fue, y sus agentes de seguridad confiscaron nuestras cámaras, las tarjetas de memoria con la grabación y nuestros celulares. Sí, Maduro se robó la entrevista para que nadie pudiera verla”, es parte del artículo.
Aquí va mi columna para The New York Times en español sobre lo que nos pasó en Venezuela.

Texto completo: FARGO - A bill to ban gun buyback programs funded by tax dollars cruised through the North Dakota House but has drawn flak from national gun-control advocates.
House Bill 1381, which passed the House 66-26 Feb. 19 and now is being considered by the Senate, would ban gun buyback programs conducted by state agencies or local governments, as well as buybacks funded by taxpayer dollars.
The penalty for violating a prohibited buyback: a misdemeanor punishable by up to 360 days in jail and a fine of up to $3,000.
Rep. Luke Simons, R-Dickinson, is the bill's prime sponsor. A rancher and former reserve deputy sheriff, Simons said he is unaware of any gun buyback programs in North Dakota, but sees them elsewhere in the country.
"I see what's happening nationwide," he said, adding that he wants to send a message that the programs are not welcome in North Dakota.
"First of all, we know the program just doesn't work," Simons said. He cites a study in Buffalo, N.Y., where buyback programs got 3,000 guns off the street over a five-year period but did not reduce rates of gun homicides, gun assaults or gun robberies.
"It just doesn't work," Simons said.
An advocate of gun buyback programs, Mike Weisser, the author of "Mike The Gun Guy," which describes itself as a magazine with news and notes from both sides about guns, called the bill "the single dumbest piece of legislation enacted anywhere in the United States."
The study is flawed, Weisser argued in a Feb. 21 blog post, because the success of gun buyback programs should be measured by the number of guns they take off the street. He touts a gun buyback program that started in Worcester, Mass., and has spread to five states that he credits with taking many guns off the street over the past 18 years.
Nicholas Kristof, a columnist for The New York Times, also criticized the proposed North Dakota ban of state and local government-sponsored gun buybacks, which he called possibly the "dumbest bit of legislation so far this year."
Kristof acknowledged that the effectiveness of gun buyback programs is controversial. "In fact," he wrote, "we don't really know whether gun buybacks are a cost-effective way to reduce gun crimes, but there is some logic to the idea that if fewer unwanted guns are lying around, there will be fewer murders, accidents and suicides."
Gun buyback programs exceed government's proper role, Simons said. They are a deliberate attempt to make gun possession seem sinister by having the government involved in confiscating guns, he said.
"If a private organization wants to do that, they are free to do that," he said of privately sponsored gun buybacks. "They have every right to do that."
Efforts to reach a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, which Simons said supports the bill, were unsuccessful on Monday.

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee may have caught former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker in a lie.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the committee believes it has proof showing President Trump asked Whitaker about having the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman, a Trump ally, take back command of the investigation into Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen.

According to one person familiar with the matter, the House Judiciary Committee is evaluating whether Whitaker perjured himself when he told the panel the White House never asked about any ongoing investigations.

“At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,” Whitaker told the House Judiciary Committee this month.

Whitaker declined to comment for the report, as did Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec who simply pointed back to Whitaker's testimony.

Last week, the New York Times reported Trump asked Whitaker about the possibility of Berman taking over the probe into Cohen, even though Berman had recused himself from the investigation examining hush money payments Cohen made to women alleging they had affairs with Trump. Whitaker reportedly told Trump that Berman couldn’t take over the investigation and there is no known evidence suggesting Whitaker took action on any request from Trump related to the matter.

Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, condemned the Times report last week and said he didn’t ask Whitaker about the recusal.

"That’s more fake news,” Trump told reporters last week. “There is a lot of fake news out there."

Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May after he pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including campaign finance violations and lying to Congress.

Texto completo: Michael Cohen , exabogado personal del presidente Donald Trump , planea decir todo sobre los trabajos que realizó para su jefe, especialmente aquellos relacionados con demandas e investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
En la sesión a puerta cerrada ante el Comité de la Cámara de Representantes se espera que Cohen detalle aspectos negativos de su exjefe, como sus expresiones racistas, la forma en que acumuló su riqueza y su posible conducta delictiva, reportó New York Times.
El Times habló con una fuente familiarizada con el testimonio, quien adelantó que Cohen llevará documentos para probar sus dichos, pero también detallará experiencias personales de los alrededor de 15 años de colaboración.
Se agrega que uno de los aspectos potencialmente dañinos del testimonio de Cohen será la evidencia de una posible conducta criminal desde que Trump asumió la presidencia .
El presidente Trump y sus aliados se han estado preparando durante varios días para los impactos del testimonio de Cohen, que tendrá lugar durante varias horas mientras el presidente se encuentra en Vietnam para una cumbre con el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un .
Se espera que los republicanos que forman parte del Comité de Supervisión y Reforma de la Cámara cuestionen agresivamente la credibilidad de Cohen, a fin de hacerlo ver como un mentiroso.
La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , calificó a Cohen de mentiroso y lo señaló como “un criminal”.
“El criminal deshonrado Michael Cohen irá a la cárcel por mentir al Congreso y hacer otras declaraciones falsas”, dijo. “Lamentablemente, irá al Congreso esta semana y podemos esperar más de lo mismo. Es risible que alguien le crea a un mentiroso condenado como Cohen”.

Standing Firm, Virginia Lt. Governor Likens Himself to Victims of Lynching

Texto completo: Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax of Virginia, who has been accused of sexual assault by two women and is facing calls to resign, compared himself to lynching victims in an unplanned speech before the State Senate on Sunday and said he was "standing firm in the truth."
Mr. Fairfax, who is black, spoke for about five minutes from the dais on the last day of the session, and referred to bills previously passed by state legislators that expressed regret over past lynchings in Virginia.
"I have heard much about anti-lynching on the floor of this very Senate, where people are not given any due process whatsoever, and we rue that," said Mr. Fairfax, a Democrat. "And yet we stand here in a rush to judgment in nothing but accusations and no facts, and we are deciding we are willing to do the same thing."
The impromptu speech came days after Mr. Fairfax's accusers indicated they were willing to testify publicly. Virginia's Republican-controlled House of Delegates announced Friday that it would hold hearings on the accusations, a move that promised to bring the spotlight back to a scandal that had started to quiet.
Meredith Watson has accused Mr. Fairfax of raping her in 2000, while they were students at Duke University. Vanessa C. Tyson, a political-science professor from California, said she was assaulted by Mr. Fairfax during the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.
Mr. Fairfax, who has repeatedly denied the allegations, declined to comment further through a spokeswoman.
Both women declined to comment on Mr. Fairfax's Sunday speech through their legal teams.
"I will not dignify that statement with a response," Ms. Watson said in a statement.
Debra Katz, a lawyer for Dr. Tyson, said Dr. Tyson stands by a statement issued Friday indicating she was prepared to testify publicly. Referring to the Republican announcement of the hearings -- and the Democratic critique of the announcement -- Dr. Tyson said she did not want to be "embroiled in a highly charged political environment."
The scandal has complicated a tenuous situation for high-ranking Democrats in Virginia politics. Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, who are white, have refused to resign after admitting they wore blackface in their youth. That has Democrats facing the difficult proposition of whether to move against Mr. Fairfax.
Lamont Bagby, a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, said Sunday that he did not "want to feed into a point that's not mine" when asked if he agreed with Mr. Fairfax's comments.
"I always sort of take a step back when individuals compare lynching or slavery to anything that happens in modern time," he said. "I will say, there are individuals on both sides of the aisle and both chambers that will stand and not allow this to be a political lynching."
He said he would like to see a law enforcement investigation into the allegations.
Todd Gilbert, the Republican House majority leader, took a harsher tone.
"That is the worst, most disgusting type of rhetoric he could have invoked," Mr. Gilbert said. "It's entirely appropriate for him to talk about due process, and we would intend to offer him every ounce of it, and he's welcome to take advantage of that anytime he would like."
Mr. Fairfax's speech Sunday came just after Thomas K. Norment Jr., the Republican Senate majority leader, praised Mr. Fairfax's professionalism during a time that was "stressful for you and your family," a point that was met with applause in the Senate chambers.
Mr. Fairfax then began speaking, admitting he had not planned to. He made several allusions to race.
"If we go backward and we rush to judgment and we allow for political lynchings without any due process, any facts, any evidence being heard, then I think we do a disservice to this very body in which we all serve," Mr. Fairfax said.
He added that he wanted a "full investigation."
"I turned 40 last Sunday; I have lived 40 years accusation-free," he said. "Fifty years ago had fingers been pointed at me in the exact same way, it would be a very different outcome. I would not be standing up here on the dais. A very different outcome would have happened with no facts, no due process, no evidence, no nothing."
Lynching has been broached after sexual misconduct allegations against other high-profile black men.
Bill Cosby's wife and representatives of R. Kelly referred to lynching when describing allegations against the two men, wrote Salamishah Tillet, now a professor of African-American and African studies at Rutgers University-Newark, in a New York Times Op-Ed last year. She also noted that Justice Clarence Thomas said his 1991 confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court had become "a high-tech lynching" because of Anita Hill's sexual harassment accusations.
False accusations of rape have been used to justify the lynching of black men. But that has typically only been when white women claim to be victims, Dr. Tillet said in an interview.
She said Mr. Fairfax's analogy "rings hollow" because it is not always true that women are believed -- black women have often had their claims dismissed. Both Dr. Tyson and Ms. Watson are black.
Dr. Tillet said Mr. Fairfax's speech was also a "smoke screen" intended to cover up sexism.
"This is kind of a subtle way of making people choose between being anti-racist and being anti-sexist," she said. "Black women are being cast as white lynch mobs. That should be a cause of deep alarm."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump spoke to the Venezuelan community in Miami on Feb. 18, highlighting the catastrophe of misgovernment in Venezuela due to its experiment with socialism. He called attention to similar situations in Cuba and Nicaragua, framing what amounted to a policy of freedom-centered government in our hemisphere.
The New York Times-sourced article, “Trump’s speech on Venezuela seen to contain veiled warning” (Star-Advertiser, Feb. 19), cast the speech as a 2020 election ploy by Trump, using terms such as “seen as a bid to win over … a critical block of voters” and “adoption of ‘socialist’ as an all-purpose epithet.”
Missing in the article is mention of the Trump-led international response to the Venezuelan nightmare with more than 20 countries (including 12 in Latin America) calling for a change in Venezuelan government.
The Star-Advertiser would better serve its readers by using news sources that provide the real impact of events without distorting interpretations that suggest a political bias.

How bad is Disney's 'Aladdin' blue Genie problem after the Will Smith reveal tanked?

Resumen: Disney unveiled Will Smith's very blue Genie from 'Aladdin' at the Grammy Awards. Now that the howling has subsided, how bad is the situation?

Texto completo: If Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action "Aladdin" would find a little love.
So far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.
It was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated "Aladdin. "
Fans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. "I fangirled so hard . . . It looks so good!" one tweeted. "I'm legit over here sobbing," another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast "special look" was skewered on social media.
The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, "They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???"
We could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on "Last Week Tonight," comparing it to the looming "disaster" when Britain leaves the European Union.
"You know how Twitter is. There’s a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith’s blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way," says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie. "
First photo: The Internet is fixated on Will Smith's Genie, and not in a good way
The backlash: Twitter rips Will Smith's 'too blue' Genie after 'Aladdin' trailer airs
Disney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action "The Jungle Book" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: “We have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May. ”
Bringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers – as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.
In December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, "I’m gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form. "
They didn't know how blue.
However awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action "The Smurfs. "
"We didn’t have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community," says Gosnell. "There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin. ' "
"The Smurfs" went on to find its audience, make $563. 7 million in the worldwide box office, and Gosnell brought the live-action creations brought back for a 2013 sequel, "The Smurfs 2. "
But there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.
Paul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's "Kazaam" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.
Glaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't "a smart thing to do. "
"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?" says Glaser.
He would have preferred seeing more of what the superstar leading man could bring. "They missed the boat in terms of trying to really explore what it would be like to rub a bottle and have Will Smith come out of it," says Glaser.
Smith has made clear he will make the part his own in the final film, which EW described in the first look story as “part Fresh Prince, part Hitch. " Smith, who acknowledged he was "terrified" to go up against Williams' "iconic" role, said in the piece his character was "different enough and unique enough that it would be in a different lane. "
There's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.
"Disney has its own magic lamps," says Bock. "And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there. "
Part of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider. com, suggests "scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen. "
The emphasis could focus on other "Aladdin" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.
Then Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.
"I just want to see Will Smith own that look and make that role his own," says Nemiroff. "I'm hoping my optimism will not be misplaced. "
Randall Jaynes, who has made a career as a deep-hued member of Blue Man Group and is now its artistic director, believes people will come to love this Genie and his vibrant coloring.
"You could already hear this Genie is Will Smith. It had his jingle and pizzazz, but the color is so evocative, it changed the look. Of course, people are going to get used to it," says Jaynes. "Welcome, Will Smith: Blue is a wonderful world to be in. "

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ call to kick libel law back to the states is baffling and dangerous. In an era where the president of the United States routinely attacks the press, our landmark libel case, New York Times v. Sullivan, must remain a cornerstone of First Amendment law.
Thomas seems to be supporting President Donald Trump’s call to “open up” libel laws to make it easier to successfully sue media companies.
“We are going to have people sue you like you’ve never got sued before,” Trump said at a Fort Worth rally during the frenzied 2016 presidential primary season. His lawyers may have convinced him that this would be tough to do under Sullivan, hence his “enemy of the people” diatribes on Twitter.
The press is under attack from our highest political office and the far right, and in this contentious political climate, journalists must remain protected against a vindictive government bearing down on us via our legal system.

All Americans have a constitutional right to criticize President Donald Trump
Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.
Mr. Trump, DOJ is not your personal justice department
In the landmark Sullivan ruling, the Supreme Court set a standard for actual malice that had to be met for press reports about public officials could be considered libel. Sullivan was birthed 55 years ago from civil rights-era conflicts as African-American leaders criticized police brutality against protesters in Alabama.
Without Sullivan, coverage of the protests in the South would have been squelched as southern public officials sought to use libel law as a cudgel to silence civil rights leaders and the reporters who covered them. Indeed, Sullivan was as much a civil rights case as it was a libel case.
Civil rights, Vietnam and Watergate reporting
How ironic then that Justice Thomas, the only African-American on the Supreme Court, is calling for a retreat on these civil rights-era protections. He made this remark in a concurring opinion released Tuesday when the court turned down an appeal from Kathrine McKee, who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. She sued Cosby for libel after his lawyers called her dishonest.
Thomas often treads his own path in the area of First Amendment law. He is a noted defender of advertising, also called commercial speech, questioning why it should be more heavily regulated than other types of speech, even political speech. He has questioned laws that regulate political contributions, and strongly supported less government regulation of street and lawn signs. However, he has opposed free speech protections for high school students and prisoners.
During the middle of the last century, the media and civil rights protesters often faced financially crippling libel suits filed by public officials and even police officers such as L. B. Sullivan of Montgomery, Alabama. The Supreme Court’s 1964 ruling in Sullivan cleared the way for more robust coverage of the Vietnam war and Watergate. The free press is compromised if it is not free to cover issues of public concern without fear of being hauled into court.
Journalists don't always win libel suits
To be clear, journalists are not totally protected from libel suits, nor are we owed blanket immunity from reckless practice. For instance, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, prevailed in his libel suit against Fact magazine over “The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater,” which was published before the election.
The magazine contended that Goldwater had a severely paranoid personality and was psychologically unfit to be president. Under Sullivan, Fact editor Ralph Ginzburg was found to have acted with actual malice: knowledge that the content was false before he published it or with reckless disregard of whether the information was false.
Provable truth is the ultimate defense in a libel suit. According to our federal law via Sullivan, if reporters get it wrong, they can certainly lose a libel case. And that’s how it should be.

Tune in to see how season of drama, missteps comes to an end

Texto completo: This year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets. But for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.
?
This Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.
All of that and Lady Gaga crooning "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.
If Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on "MacGyver."
It's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.
Adweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2.6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.
Pulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.
In 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.
Hart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.
The internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where "The View's" Whoopi Goldberg is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?
The last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head on a wall about this.
Just seeing how the show's producers handle the opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth making sure you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.
Queen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one "We Will Rock You" stomp.
Then there's the other drama that's erupted this year around major re-tooling of the show – revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the "popular film" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in "Star Wars."
There have been other stands and hasty retreats by the Academy leadership. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed – "Shallow" and Kendrick Lamar's "All the Stars" – led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.
In another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained – from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.
Just two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live. These changes are tough.
"It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown," Gigliotti told The New York Times.
Watching live awards shows, and live TV productions such as "Grease Live," multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.
And who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time.
Awards audiences already are tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show – with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.
Not to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.
All of this is on top of the vivid plot lines that have emerged this awards season. Popular hits "Black Panther," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "A Star Is Born," and "Green Book" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.
History of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.

Woody Allen Starts A New Film in Spain

Texto completo: Just weeks after suing Amazon for canceling a four-movie deal, Woody Allen is working on a new film in Spain.
The project is being backed by Mediapro, a Barcelona-based conglomerate that has financed several films by Allen, including the romantic dramas "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" and "Midnight in Paris." A spokeswoman for the company confirmed Allen was already working on the film, but said she could not confirm any other details such as local media reports that he had already scouted locations.
Allen has been under scrutiny over longstanding abuse allegations that he molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.
In August 2017, Amazon reached a $68 million deal with Allen's production company to fund and distribute at least four movies, including "A Rainy Day in New York." Later that year, Farrow wrote an op-ed piece in The Los Angeles Times, arguing that the #MeToo movement has "spared" the once-revered director.
According to a lawsuit, Amazon executives met with members of Allen's team to discuss postponing the release of "A Rainy Day in New York," which Allen had completed, to 2019. The studio said it had already been facing "negative publicity and reputational harm" for its past association with Harvey Weinstein.
Last June, Amazon Studios sent an email to Allen's representatives saying that the deal was terminated, citing the renewed allegations, the director's "own comments, and the increasing refusal of top talent to work with or be associated with him in any way, all of which have frustrated the purpose of the agreement."
"A Rainy Day in New York" has yet to be released; the last of Allen's films to hit theaters in the United States was the 2017 drama "Wonder Wheel," which was distributed by Amazon Studios.
Amazon has partnered with Mediapro in the past, but it is not involved with Allen's new project. And Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, said in a New York Times report this week that the company does not have plans to release any movies by the director.
When asked why it was working with Allen given that Amazon had stopped doing so, Mediapro said in a statement, "We have a 10-year relationship with Mr. Allen and, like all projects we produce, we judge the creator by its work."
"All of our projects have a unique personality, and we support all types of artistic voices and ideas and remain committed to producing well-defined and creative projects for audiences worldwide," the statement continued.
Allen's work has long found more success abroad, particularly in Europe. In an interview with The Times in 1998, Allen said his movies rarely break even in the United States. He added: "I've always depended on Europe to supplement my grosses."
"Wonder Wheel" brought in only $1.4 million in North America. It collected nearly $14.5 million overseas, with its highest revenues in France, Italy and Spain, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks ticket sales.
Allen's reputation may have cost him the Amazon deal and alienated a number of A-list actors, but some have come to his defense. In October, Javier Bardem, who starred in "Vicky Cristina Barcelona," called the upheaval surrounding the abuse allegations a "public lynching" and said he would work with Allen again. In an interview in The Times published in November, Jude Law, who worked with Allen on "A Rainy Day in New York," said the shelving of the film by Amazon was a "terrible shame."
"I'd love to see it," Law said. "People worked really hard and put a lot in, obviously himself included."
Even as the filmmaker was wrapping up production on "A Rainy Day in New York" last year, he had already secured financing for a script he was working on outside the Amazon agreement, Letty Aronson, Allen's sister and longtime producer, told The Times.
"I have no doubt," she said, "that he'll be able to find new talent."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Pinterest Is Said to Quietly File for I.P.O., Joining a Stampede

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Pinterest confidentially filed paperwork to go public, according to two people familiar with the decision, joining a stampede of high-profile start-ups heading toward the public markets.
The company, which has an app and a website that allow people to save images and links to virtual pin boards, filed its paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early February, the people said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the filing publicly.
Private market investors have valued Pinterest at $12 billion. In September, it was expected to top $700 million in revenue last year, a 50 percent increase from 2017. At the time, it had 250 million monthly active users.
Mike Mayzel, a Pinterest spokesman, declined to comment.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Pinterest had filed the paperwork with regulators.
The stampede of initial public offerings by highly valued Silicon Valley companies has intensified in recent weeks. Lyft is preparing to begin trading its shares in late April. Its ride-hailing rival, Uber, which filed its initial paperwork with the S.E.C. last year, is expected to follow. Investment bankers have estimated that Uber could be worth $120 billion on the public market.
Slack, an office messaging app company, has also filed to go public. The company was last valued at $7.1 billion by private investors. Postmates, a food delivery app worth nearly $2 billion, has also filed confidential paperwork to go public.
Pinterest has plenty of cash: It raised around $1.5 billion in venture capital funding and has come close to profitability in the past. But it is unclear how investors will view the company, which makes money from online advertising and competes against Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter and Snap for market share.
The company is unusual in Silicon Valley for its avoidance of hype and media coverage. That reluctance has frustrated some investors and executives, leading to executive turnover in recent years.
But others view Pinterest's reserved, slow and steady approach as the reason for its success. In contrast to its social media peers like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest has taken bold steps to eradicate potentially harmful disinformation from its platform. The company recently removed search results for content related to vaccines to prevent false anti-vaccination memes and information from spreading.
Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra founded Pinterest in 2010. The company's growth took off soon after, particularly among Midwestern women.
In recent years, user growth had slowed, but Mr. Silbermann, the chief executive, resisted Silicon Valley's typical tricks for juicing the numbers in the short term, favoring what he called "quality growth."
"There's a natural rate at which you can scale a company that's healthy," he told The New York Times last year.
A year ago, the company hired Francoise Brougher as its chief operating officer, a move that many people in the industry saw as a sign that Pinterest would soon tap the public markets. Ms. Brougher helped take Square, the payments company, public in 2015.
In November, in a sign that it wanted to promote itself more than it had in the past, the company hired Andréa Mallard, formerly a marketer at Gap Inc.'s Athleta brand, as its chief marketing officer.
Some of the companies from this generation of start-ups plan to do nontraditional public offerings called direct listings.
In a direct listing, companies do not go on I.P.O. "road shows" to pitch their stock to potential investors, nor do they issue new shares or arrange stock sales in advance of the listing. This avoids lockup periods when a stock first goes on the market. During that period, insiders cannot sell their stock.
The option is attractive for companies that have no need to tap the public markets for more money. It has piqued the interest of highly valued start-ups that have raised billions from private market investors.
Spotify, the music streaming company, had a successful direct listing last year. Slack plans to follow in its footsteps with a similar transaction in the coming months.
But Pinterest plans to pursue a traditional I.P.O., one of the people familiar with the situation said.

Texto completo: "President Trump has proved himself adroit at creating villains to serve as his political foils," states The New York Times. "In his State of the Union address, he introduced a new one: socialists ... . Mr. Trump chose to introduce the socialist menace in perhaps the highest-profile setting available."
"Yet," sniffs The Times in protest, "there is no evidence of any growing public angst about socialism sweeping the United States."
Memo to the Times: Actually, there's plenty of evidence, not only throughout the United States but within the Democratic Party. And where there isn't angst there's troubling acceptance, thus creating further angst within the Democratic Party. The Times piece, ironically, proceeded to show just that, even quoting a source who rightly noted of Democratic Party socialists Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-N.Y. and others: "They want to take the country toward socialism and their party is divided on that and there is a major fight in their party over whether to be a socialist party."
For such reasons, Trump said that he was "alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
It was a revealing, signature moment for Trump, but also for the Democratic Party.
To their credit, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer applauded Trump's line, as did a decent number of Democrats, including no less than Elizabeth Warren, who stood and applauded vigorously. It was a striking sight.
It was also a striking dichotomy among Democrats.
Every camera in that chamber during the State of the Union caught an agitated Sanders visibly uncomfortable with Trump's rebuke of socialism. Likewise uneasy, sitting there stone-faced, was Ocasio-Cortez, who's one of many members of the Democratic Socialists of America, the self-described "largest socialist organization in the United States," elected in November. These DSA members ran not on a DSA ticket but the Democratic Party ticket. Seated not far from Ocasio-Cortez was a fellow DSA socialist-turned-Democrat, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who shortly after her swearing-in ceremony vowed of Trump, "we're gonna impeach the (blankety blank)!"
They're hardly the only Democrats with socialist sympathies recently elected. Here in Western Pennsylvania, voters elected two DSA members to the state house, Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato.
How popular is socialism among modern Democrats?
In the 2016 Democratic Party primary, lifetime socialist Sanders received
13 million votes, or 40 percent of Democrat votes. Finishing as runner-up in 2106 presumably makes Bernie the frontrunner for 2020. This week, he announced his candidacy, vowing nothing short of "transforming the country" to complete "the political revolution" begun in 2016.
And beyond that, Democrats are already hooked on running Ocasio-Cortez for president the day she turns age-eligible. DNC chair Tom Perez enthuses that the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez "represents the future of our party."
Really, Chairman Perez? A socialist is the future of your party? What would Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy think about that?
The answer is they'd be stunned.
I was pleased to see Pelosi, Schumer and Warren apparently approve of our president's insistence that America not become socialist. I applaud that. Now it's time they do something about their own party becoming socialist. This is less a battle between Trump and Democrats than Democrats and democratic socialists.

Texto completo: URBANA -- Fifteen years makes a huge gap in a family's life.
For those who've seen Henrik Ibsen's masterpiece "A Doll's House," that's when the clock started ticking, with Nora Helmer leaving her family and entire life behind.
The Celebration Company's newest production at the Station Theatre is "A Doll's House, Part 2." The play is written by Lucas Hnath and directed by Celebration Company Artistic Director Rick Orr.
In "A Doll's House, Part 2," Nora Helmer is returning home after closing the door on her life with her husband, Torvald, and their three children 15 years earlier.
Written by Tony Award nominee Lucas Hnath, "A Doll's House, Part 2" explores gender roles and societal expectations through the eyes of a woman mired in an era for which she is simply too exceptional.
Orr's cast features Gary Ambler, Cara Maurizi, Barbara Ridenour and Lindsey Gates-Markel. The play is moving. But it also has humor, producer Kay Holley said.
In his review of the New York production, the New York Times critic Ben Brantley called the play "smart, funny and utterly engrossing."
"One interesting thing is that, although the play's action ostensibly takes place in the 1890s (and the characters will be costumed to reflect that) the language of the play has a very modern feel and sound," Holley said.
Playwright Hnath subtly blurs the lines between then and now, which enriches the themes nicely, she added.
And, as Brantley also points out, "The contemporary speech of his characters puts their conversation more completely in our heads. As it should. It's our conversation, too, and it's been going on since Nora gave back her wedding ring more than a century ago."
In the play, the housekeeper, Anne Marie, asks the significant question: What has she been doing all these years?
"Keep guessing," says Nora, "this is fun."
Holley said the play will make audiences question some of their assumptions.
"Hnath's play gives renewed life to the ideas that were introduced in ïA Doll's House,' and, I think, it invites us to join in the discussion," Holley said.

Suing to protect the right to just be left alone

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: Two American women are trying to return home to North America after realizing they don't want to be a part of the Islamic State anymore.

More than four years ago, Hoda Muthana, then a college student in Alabama, bought a plane ticket to Turkey with her tuition money and was smuggled into the caliphate in Syria. She’s been married to three ISIS fighters over the years and gave birth to a son, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

Last month, she surrendered to American troops and is being held in a detainee camp in northeastern Syria.

“I realized how I didn’t appreciate or maybe even really understand how important the freedoms that we have in America are. I do now,” she wrote to a lawyer trying to help her return to the United States. “To say that I regret my past words, any pain that I caused my family and any concerns I would cause my country would be hard for me to really express properly.”

After joining ISIS, Muthana witnessed executions and urged others to join the group in social media posts.

“Americans wake up!” she wrote on Twitter on March 15, 2015. “You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them.”

Muthana now says she “can’t believe” what she’s done.

“I ruined my life. I ruined my future,” she said.

Another woman, Kimberly Gwen Polman, who lived in Canada before joining ISIS but has dual citizenship in the U.S., also expressed regret about joining the terrorist group and wants to return to North America.

“I don’t have words for how much regret I have,” the 46-year-old said. “How do you go from burning a passport to crying yourself to sleep because you have so much deep regret? How do you do that? How do you show people that?”

It’s unclear if both women will brought back to their home countries. The women said they have not been visited by American officials since they were captured in January.

Trump attacks New York Times as ‘true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE’

Texto completo: President Trump directed his ire at the New York Times on Wednesday morning, declaring the publication the “true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”

The New York Times published a lengthy piece a day prior, describing how the president had waged a public, though sometimes secret, assault on the investigations surrounding him. His tactics, the report said, had made him susceptible to accusations that he has obstructed justice in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and the Southern District of New York investigations.

Trump singled out the Times for its reporting, veering from his usual schtick of referring to the “fake news” media as the enemy of the people.

“The New York Times reporting is false. They are a TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” he wrote, not referring to any specific example from the newspaper.


Trump denied part of the Times report Tuesday, which said Trump asked then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker late last year to put the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, a Trump loyalist, in charge of the investigation into Michael Cohen after the attorney had already recused himself from the probe.

“No, I don’t know who gave you that,” Trump said of asking Whitaker about the recusal.

Which Republicans will follow example set by Labour's exit?

Texto completo: By Jennifer Rubin

The Washington Post

One party has become more ideologically extreme, embracing bigotry and erratic, self-defeating positions on foreign policy. As a result, seven members leave the party, citing their moral objections to their party's descent into craziness. Don't get your hopes up; that was all about Britain's Labour Party, which has fallen under the spell of Jeremy Corbyn, who, along with many in his party, don't hesitate to embrace anti-Semitism and all sorts of conspiracy theories.

The New York Times reports that the seven defectors rejected Corbyn's radicalism:

"Labour and the governing Conservatives both appear to be buckling as they grapple with the ramifications of Britain's imminent departure from the European Union, or Brexit. ...

"'Both of the main parties are pulling away from the center ground, where traditionally British elections are won,' said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. 'Many members of Parliament in both parties think that the current situation can't go on, they don't think it can remain stable.'

"'The question,' he added, 'is whether there is a potential correcting mechanism with British politics that means that the broad mass of moderate voters can find a way of voting for moderate members of Parliament, to bring politics back from the extreme left and the Brexit hard right.'"

We feel Britain's pain.

For now, those seven sit as independents in Parliament, but perhaps they can revive the moribund Liberal Party or force Labour to reevaluate its descent into quackery.

The most impressive of the defectors may have been Luciana Berger, just 37 years old and "a vocal critic of Mr. Corbyn's handling of anti-Semitism allegations, and [who] was threatened with a vote of no-confidence by local party activists, a motion that was eventually withdrawn." She drew a line in the sand:

"Last year, Ms. Berger protested when it emerged that, in 2012, Mr. Corbyn had endorsed a mural on a wall in east London that appeared to depict a group of caricatured Jewish bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of the poor. Since that episode, for which he apologized, Mr. Corbyn, who is a vehement and unapologetic critic of the current Israeli government, has failed to shake off claims that he has tolerated anti-Semitism within Labour's ranks.

"'I cannot remain in a party that I have come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic,' said Ms. Berger, who is Jewish."

Now imagine if even a handful of Republicans recognized that the Republican Party has become institutionally racist, xenophobic and hostile to the rule of law.

Imagine if, say, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has challenged her party for turning off women voters, or Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who has deplored the phony national emergency declaration, were to march out of the GOP, inviting colleagues to follow. Maybe Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, could formally check out of the party as well. (She has already drawn the party's ire with votes against repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.)

The rebels could sit as independents for now, but perhaps they'd encourage like-minded center-right candidates to run under a single umbrella. A few defections here and there might light a fire under some in the GOP lawmakers who have done little or nothing but enable President Donald Trump, rubber-stamp his extreme and/or unqualified nominees, smear the FBI and intelligence community, condone Trump's unsavory embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as look the other way as the president gives comfort to neo-Nazis, rails about "s hole countries" and carries out a campaign of lies designed to stir up fear and hatred of immigrants.

The Republican Party will not be saved unless and until men and women of good conscience and patriotic fervor withdraw their support from the Trumpized GOP. In 2018, that took the form of some Republican voters casting ballots for Democrats in House races. In 2020, those voters horrified by the state of the GOP could support primary challengers to Trump and Trump enablers or, alternatively, find independent conservative candidates. If need be, they could vote for a moderate Democratic nominee against Trump.

In the meantime, one would like to think there are a handful of men and women in the Republican Party on this side of the Atlantic willing to say, "Enough."

I tend to doubt it, but I'd love to be proved wrong.

Vatican secret out: There are rules for priests who father children

Texto completo: The Catholic Church has required celibacy from its priests for centuries, yet those vows were broken so frequently that the Vatican established a secret set of guidelines for dealing with clerics who fathered children.
This latest revelation, first reported by The New York Times, comes amid a new wave of developments tied to the burgeoning sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church for close to two decades.
On Monday, the Diocese of Oakland, California, released a list of 45 clergymen and religious brothers it said have had “credible accusations’’ of child sexual abuse made against them, going as far back as the 1960s. Several other dioceses have taken similar steps in recent months.
On Saturday, Pope Francis defrocked former Washington archbishop Theodore McCarrick after he was found guilty of a series of sexual crimes, making him the first American cardinal to be expelled from the priesthood.
Two weeks ago, Francis acknowledged the long-known but rarely addressed problem of nuns being sexually assaulted by priests.

Now, just ahead of Thursday’s unprecedented meeting of more than 100 bishops summoned to the Vatican to address the sexual misconduct crisis, the Catholic Church faces yet another sexually related controversy.
Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti acknowledged to the Times and other news outlets the existence of the guidelines, although he would not reveal specifically what they are.

Gisotti said the instructions seek to protect the child and require – others contend they only encourage – the priest to request a leave from his clerical duties and “as a layman, assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively’’ to the child.
Vincent Doyle, an Irish psychotherapist who learned in his late 20s his father was a priest, told the Times that church leaders initially misled him to believe his was a rare instance.
Though there’s no exact count of how many children have been fathered by clergymen, he eventually learned that wasn’t true when an archbishop showed him the Vatican instructions for cases like his.
“It’s the next scandal,’’ Doyle said. “There are kids everywhere. ’’

Doyle formed a global support group, Coping International, that provides counseling and resources to “children of the ordained,’’ as the church calls them. He said the organization’s website has 50,000 users in 175 countries.
Doyle told CBS News he wants to see them codified so the offspring of clergymen don’t have to live in the shadows. The Irish Catholic Church did as much two years ago, establishing a set of rules that prioritize the child’s well-being and mandate that the priest own up to his parental duties in every way.
“The first problem with children of priests is they're not recognized," Doyle said. “When you're hidden … you are characterized by secrecy. ’’

Interest in St. Marks Flash race surpasses test

Texto completo: What makes a race a success is difficult to determine and certainly varies from one event to another. Reasons for putting on a race vary from raising awareness of a disease, protecting the memory or legacy of someone, fundraising, and of course an opportunity to race.
There are for-profit events and nonprofit. As a result, the variations in events range from the very simple 5K with less than 100 participants to the marathons with tens of thousands of participants traveling over the streets of major cities such as Boston and New York (and of course Tallahassee).
With the recent completion of the Flash 12K and 6K races at St. Marks it's interesting to review the numbers.
RunSignUp, a race registration company, just released a report titled "Race Trends – Annual Statistical Report." The company reports it registered 6,228,326 participants during 2018, a 26% increase over 2017.
However, in order to try and measure whether the endurance events covered by RunSignUp are increasing in size (as opposed to whether the company is growing because it is picking up new business), RunSignUp compared just the races it provided registration services to in both 2017 and 2019. In that comparison, the numbers suggest a slight decrease of .01 percent fewer people registering (4,336,935 in 2017 and 4,331,563 in 2018).
RunSignUp noted "This reinforces general reports of flat to declining number of race finishers from Running USA and the New York Times."
I recommend the report for race directors looking to improve attendance at their races. The data is not complete – as the authors point out the data is built only from races where RunSignUp is the registration software. But it is still informative to review and analyze.
One of the conclusions of the report was:
"[T]hat runners are seeking diversity in their participation - trying new events each year, and prioritizing events with unique, fun elements (and often, those that are untimed)."
This advice was followed by a recommendation:
"Cultivate a distinctive brand for your race and use email marketing, social media, and referral programs to reinforce the message that your race is unique."
An ecstatic Keith Rowe had finally reached a point on Saturday, Feb. 16, where he could stop worrying about the details of the Flash 12K and 6K races and instead enjoy the setting for the post-race celebration at Cooter Stew Café in St. Marks. The big smile on his face told everyone how he thought the morning had gone. The turnout, just short of 300, was good. Keith's second time at directing these races was, in fact, a resounding success.
Mark Priddy, Keith's predecessor, was there to help assure continuity in an event that was first run in 1989. Joe Dexter, the first race director and creator of the event says the idea of putting on a 12K race came to him while reading about two of the largest races in the United States — Bay to Breakers in San Francisco and the Bloomsday Run in Spokane. Shocked that a 12K could be such a large race, Joe decided to introduce Tallahassee to the idea.
Mark's seven years as race director ended in 2017 but he left a strong foundation for his successor. It was, in fact, Mark who moved the race from J Lewis Hall Park in Woodville to the confluence of the St. Marks and Wakulla Rivers near the San Marcos de Apalache State Park.
The courses run through a St. Marks neighborhood for about 2 miles before jumping on the St. Marks Rails to Trails path and heading north. Each race turns around on the trail at their respective turn around points and retrace the same routes to return to the start (and finish) line.
The distances of 12K and 6K are unique as far as the local race scene goes. (Not entirely unique of course as the December race at the ARP, the Tannenbaum, is a 6K cross country race.) Add to that the opportunity for a fun postrace social in the small town of St. Marks (this year at Cooter Stew Cafe) and you have a fun event that hopefully will keep growing.
Looks pretty good in light of the recommendations from the RunSignUp report.
David Yon is addicted to running. In his spare time, he is an attorney with the Radey Law Firm.

Bloodshot Records says it 'failed' Lydia Loveless

Texto completo: Lydia Loveless, an acclaimed singer and songwriter, became the latest musician to join the rising tide of #MeToo voices in the music business over the weekend when she took to social media to speak out against a surprising culprit: her Chicago-based record label, Bloodshot Records.
For a quarter century, Bloodshot has been revered for its artists-first approach to music-making, and has accrued a reputation for community involvement and integrity.
But in the last few days, Loveless made a series of statements on social media that paints the label in a less flattering light amid allegations that she was emotionally and sexually harassed for several years by musician Mark Panick, the life partner of label co-owner Nan Warshaw. She asserted that she felt betrayed by Warshaw after one incident was brought to the label co-owner's attention without any immediate action being taken, and blamed the label "for allowing a man to grope, paw at and mentally disturb me for over five years."
Warshaw apologized in a statement Sunday "for any hell or even awkwardness I put Lydia or anyone through, due to my actions or inactions" and announced that "for the moment I'm going to step away from Bloodshot."
She clarified in a follow-up email Monday to the Tribune that "the length of time that I am 'stepping away' will depend on what is best for the artists and the staff" and that she "will be involved in the label going forward, as co-owner, unless at some point I decide it is no longer best for the artists." She declined to comment on the allegations about Panick beyond stating that "I did not witness them."
Label co-owner Rob Miller added in a separate email to the Tribune that "it was the consensus that her (Warshaw's) presence, while she works on her personal life, would be a distraction to the staff and to the artists."
Panick, who is not a label employee, had been banned from all label events and prevented from contacting Loveless. On Monday, he issued a written statement to the Tribune: "Anyone accused of something like this that doesn't immediately do some kind of internal audit is just not paying attention. I am no saint and behaviors learned in the past can be unlearned. I do not remember the events Lydia describes in the same way. But I truly regret making her feel like that and really wish I'd have understood that at the moment."
Miller initially responded Sunday to the Loveless accusations with a statement acknowledging they are "essentially, and sadly, true."
Though he said that once he found out that Panick was allegedly harassing Loveless he acted immediately to ban him from all Bloodshot events, "I realized I had failed in not recognizing that one of our artists was made to feel uncomfortable by someone. ... Not seeing the behavior disrespected her immensely."
Miller added that he encouraged Loveless over the last 2 1/2 years to make a "frank and forthcoming" statement about the alleged harassment. Warshaw said she didn't make the issue public out of respect for Loveless' privacy. "I am relieved Lydia is talking about it now," she said.
Loveless spoke out after a New York Times report connected singer-songwriter Ryan Adams to a long string of emotionally and sexually abusive relationships involving a number of female musicians, including one reported to be 14 years old at the time of the alleged abuse. Adams released his first solo album on Bloodshot in 2000 but has since been affiliated with major labels.
In responding to the Adams allegations on Twitter, Loveless wrote that she was "gutted and hurt by an industry that claims to be creative and here for us and that only proves more and more every day to be just like everything ... else."
As an example, Loveless singled out Bloodshot, which has released three of her studio albums, a compilation and an EP since signing her out of Ohio when she was 19 in 2011. The next day, she elaborated on the allegation on Instagram, where she named Panick as the person "who has long been a source of strife for me" and detailed a number of incidents involving groping and sexually explicit comments. Though Panick did not have an official role at Bloodshot, Loveless wrote, "He was, for years, as much a face of the label as anyone." She said she came to dread label events because of his presence.
"I don't think Bloodshot has maliciously encouraged this behavior but instead quieted it to protect their brand," she wrote, "and it has indeed been covered up in my eyes, as the behavior only ceased when I was informed they wanted to begin signing more women."
Earlier, Bloodshot posted a statement on its Facebook page that described its relationship with Adams when he was signed to the label in the late '90s: "The Ryan Adams we have been hearing about over the past few days bears no resemblance to the one we knew back then. To be emphatically clear, we never saw or heard a hint of the appalling behavior now coming to light. We are as shocked and disappointed as everyone else."
The Adams allegations in the New York Times report have brought immediate consequences. The FBI said it would investigate Adams' alleged sexts with an underage girl, three musical equipment makers have severed business deals with the artist, and Universal Music Group has reportedly canceled release of Adams' next album, originally scheduled for April.
The Adams and Loveless revelations suggested that the moral and ethical differences between the independent music scene and the corporate music behemoths were not as significant as they once might have appeared.
Miller said as much in his Bloodshot statement on Sunday: "To our fans and supporters who will find this whole matter surprising and disappointing at the very least, and sickening at worst: this behavior is a violation of our nearly quarter century relationship with you that we hold so dear. It runs contrary to the label we've tried to be and to the spirit of the music and artists we've been associated with."
The comments echoed those of Phoebe Bridgers, one of the artists interviewed about her relationship with Adams in the New York Times. She issued a statement Sunday in which she indicted a "network" of enablers: "Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn't, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn't have done this without them."

Texto completo: About a month ago, the top of a power pole broke and three transformers came down in the middle of Route 85, near Van, and blocked the road about six hours. Do you think we should warn the tourists? And to all you hotdog Republicans, get those taxes in, Trump needs the money to build that wall.
Its amazing what the right-wingers are saying and trying to blame it on Democrats. Democracy has suffered like it never had in years controlled by them. Sending children to internment camps is at top of the list. Passing laws to poison streams.
Just a question: If the schools in West Virginia (no WV, you notice) are so deplorable, failing on several levels, no future for our kids, why on earth has someone not fired Steve Paine???
I compared my last year's income tax using 2017 instructions and again using 2018 instructions. The result was using this year's instructions, I paid $1,758 less in taxes. Thanks to Trump!
To the Venter asking about the disappearance of furniture from Kanawha Country Club (now Little Creek Country Club), the cheap stuff there now needs replaced.
What was Mitch Carmichael thinking of when he introduced the omnibus education bill to protect us from union thugs and underachieving teachers? The New York Times had it right when they wrote, "But the troubling reality is this: West Virginia Senate Bill 451 is a subtle and manipulative attempt by state legislators to disenfranchise the voices of the community they were elected to amplify. And just like West Virginia teachers set a strong precedent for organizers seeking equity in other states, legislation like this could set a dangerous precedent for politicians interested in using bullying tactics to silence the voices of their constituents, even at the expense of the state's school children." Please keep Carmichael, Rucker and Blair in your memory come next campaign and election.
West Virginia roads are in the worst shape they've been in in years. We couldn't pay a big company to move their business, to move operations to West Virginia. The big story from legislature: somebody said something that hurt somebody's feelings.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vowed on Sunday to investigate whether the top officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. plotted an "attempted bureaucratic coup" to remove President Trump from office, and said he would subpoena the former F.B.I. director and the deputy attorney general if necessary.
Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was reacting to an interview in which the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe, confirmed an earlier New York Times report that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, had suggested wearing a wire in meetings with Mr. Trump and that Justice Department officials had discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.
Mr. Rosenstein has disputed the account.
"I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened," Mr. Graham said on the CBS program "Face the Nation," calling Mr. McCabe's assertion "beyond stunning." He added: "I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of Department of Justice, F.B.I. behavior toward President Trump and his campaign."
Asked by the program's host, Margaret Brennan, if he would subpoena Mr. McCabe and Mr. Rosenstein to testify, Mr. Graham said, "How can I not if that's what it takes?" He promised to have a hearing to find out "who's telling the truth."
A Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, agreed with Mr. Graham that Mr. McCabe's remarks "deserve scrutiny." But he took issue with Mr. Graham's characterization of the situation.
"I don't think that this frankly rises to the level of some deep state conspiracy or a serious attempt at what Senator Graham called an administrative coup," said Mr. Coons, also speaking on "Face the Nation." "I suspect that once this is fully discussed, it'll be clearer that this was a brief or passing conversation that's been taken out of context."
Mr. McCabe made the explosive remarks in an interview with the CBS program "60 Minutes," released in part on Thursday, in advance of its full airing Sunday evening. He said Justice Department officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump's decision in May 2017 to fire James B. Comey, the bureau's director, that they discussed whether to recruit cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment, which outlines the succession plan should the president become incapacitated, resign or die in office.
In a second clip of the interview aired Sunday on "Face the Nation," Mr. McCabe said he spoke to the president just after Mr. Comey was fired, and subsequently ordered the bureau's team investigating Russia's election interference to look into whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey. The F.B.I. also began examining whether Mr. Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
Mr. McCabe said that he and others were "concerned about a national security threat."
He continued: "And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the F.B.I. to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, 'Why would a president of the United States do that?"'
He added, "So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder, is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?"
Mr. McCabe was fired by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, on the eve of his retirement in March 2018, after being accused of a lack of candor. The "60 Minutes" interview was part of a book tour to promote his memoir, "The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," which will be released this week.

THE TWO CODES YOUR KIDS NEED TO KNOW THE COLLEGE BOARD CAME UP WITH A SURPRISING CONCLUSION ABOUT KEYS TO SUCCESS FOR COLLEGE AND LIFE, WRITES NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

Texto completo: A few years ago, the leaders of the College Board, the folks who administer the SAT college entrance exam, asked themselves a radical question: Of all the skills and knowledge that we test young people for that we know are correlated with success in college and in life, which is the most important? Their answer: the ability to master "two codes" - computer science and the U.S. Constitution.
Since then they've been adapting the SATs and the College Board's Advanced Placement program to inspire and measure knowledge of both. Since the two people who led this move - David Coleman, president of the College Board, and Stefanie Sanford, its chief of global policy - happen to be people I've long enjoyed batting around ideas with, and since I thought a lot of students, parents and employers would be interested in their answer, I asked them to please show their work: "Why these two codes?"
Their short answer was that if you want to be an empowered citizen in our democracy - able not only to navigate society and its institutions but also to improve and shape them, and not just be shaped by them - you need to know how the code of the U.S. Constitution works. And if you want to be an empowered and adaptive worker or artist or writer or scientist or teacher - and be able to shape the world around you, and not just be shaped by it - you need to know how computers work and how to shape them.
Building blocks
With computing, the internet, big data and artificial intelligence now the essential building blocks of almost every industry, any young person who can master the principles and basic coding techniques that drive computers and other devices "will be more prepared for nearly every job," Mr. Coleman and Ms. Sanford said in a joint statement explaining their initiative. "At the same time, the Constitution forms the foundational code that gives shape to America and defines our essential liberties - it is the indispensable guide to our lives as productive citizens."
So rather than have SAT exams and Advanced Placement courses based on things that you cram for and forget, they are shifting them, where they can, to promote the "two codes."
In 2016, the College Board completely revamped its approach to AP computer science courses and exams. In the original Computer Science course, which focused heavily on programming in Java, nearly 80 percent of students were men. And a large majority were white and Asian, said Mr. Coleman. What that said to women and underrepresented minorities was, "How would you like to learn the advanced grammar of a language that you aren't interested in?"
Turned out that was not very welcoming. So, explained Mr. Coleman, they decided to "change the invitation" to their new Computer Science Principles course by starting with the question: What is it that you'd like to do in the world? Music? Art? Science? Business? Great! Then come build an app in the furtherance of that interest and learn the principles of computer science, not just coding, Mr. Coleman said. "Learn to be a shaper of your environment, not just a victim of it."
Entice with a question
The new course debuted in 2016. Enrollment was the largest for a new course in the history of Advanced Placement, with just over 44,000 students nationwide.
Two years later The Christian Science Monitor reported, "More high school students than ever are taking the College Board's Advanced Placement computer science exams, and those taking them are increasingly female and people of color."
Indeed, the story added, "the College Board reports that from 2017 to 2018 female, African-American and Hispanic students were among the fastest growing demographics of AP computer science test-takers, with increases in exam participation of 39 percent, 44 percent and 41 percent, respectively. . For context, in 2007, fewer than 3,000 high school girls took the AP Computer Science A exam; in 2018, more than 15,000 completed it."
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course also was reworked. At a time when we have a president who doesn't act as if he's read the Constitution - and we have a growing perception and reality that college campuses are no longer venues for the free exchange of ideas and real debate of consequential issues - Mr. Coleman and Ms. Sanford concluded that it was essential that every student entering college actually have command of the First Amendment, which enshrines five freedoms, not just freedom of speech.
Every student needs to understand that, as Mr. Coleman put it, "our country was argued into existence - and that is the first thing that binds us - but also has some of the tensions that divide us. So we thought, 'What can we do to help replace the jeering with productive conversation?'"
The five freedoms
It had to start in high school, said Ms. Sanford, who is leading the "two codes" initiative. "Think of how much more ready you are to participate in college and society with an understanding of the five freedoms that the First Amendment protects - of speech, assembly, petition, press and religion. The First Amendment lays the foundation for a mature community of conversation and ideas - built on the right and even obligation to speak up and, when needed, to protest, but not to interrupt and prevent others from speaking."
This becomes particularly important, she noted, "when technology and democracy are thought of as in conflict, but are actually both essential" and need to work in tandem.
One must observe only how Facebook was abused in the 2016 election to see that two of the greatest strengths of America - innovation and free speech - have been weaponized. If they are not harmonized, well, Houston, we have a problem.
So the new AP government course is built on an in-depth look at 15 Supreme Court cases as well as nine foundational documents that every young American should know. It shows how the words of the Constitution give rise to the structures of our government.
Content of lasting merit
Besides revamping the government course and the exam on that subject, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Sanford in 2014 made a staple of the regular SAT a long reading comprehension passage from one of the founding documents, such as the Constitution, or another important piece of democracy, like a great presidential speech. That said to students and teachers something the SAT had never dared say before: Some content is disproportionately more powerful and important, and if you prepare for it you will be rewarded on the SAT.
Ms. Sanford grew up in Texas and was deeply affected as a kid watching video of the African-American congresswoman Barbara Jordan arguing the case against Richard Nixon in Watergate. What she remembered most, said Ms. Sanford, was how Jordan's power "emanated from her command of the Constitution.
"Understanding how government works is the essence of power. To be a strong citizen, you need to know how the structures of our government work and how to operate within them."
Kids are getting it: An AP U.S. Government and Politics class at Hightstown High School in New Jersey was credited in a Senate committee report with contributing content to a bill, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act, which was signed into law last month.
Ms. Sanford cites it as a great example of her mantra: "'Knowledge, skills and agency' - kids learn things, learn how to do things and then discover that they can use all that to make a difference in the world."

Texto completo: On Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency at the border to get access to billions of dollars to build a wall, after Congress granted far less money than he'd wanted. It's the latest twist in a theme that has been central to Mr. Trump's candidacy and presidency.
As a candidate, his language about the southern border was remarkably simple: He would build a great wall, and Mexico would pay for it. He repeated this promise hundreds of times. But his language shifted after he won the election, particularly since the government shutdown.
The words at right represent nearly all Mr. Trump's public remarks about who would pay for the border wall since he declared his candidacy for president.
Before becoming the Republican nominee, Mr. Trump rarely got into specifics when saying Mexico would pay for a wall; he simply assured his supporters that it would. No issue was more associated with his candidacy than immigration, and the border wall was the centerpiece of that issue.
After the election, Mr. Trump continued to insist that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began to qualify that it would do so "in the end," "ultimately," "indirectly" or through "reimbursement."
Leading up to and during the 34-day government shutdown, Mr. Trump was more specific still, suggesting that Mexico would effectively be paying for the wall because of the money saved by the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. (The New York Times found no evidence to support this claim.)
In recent days, Mr. Trump has talked less about "building" a wall and more about "finishing" a wall. At a recent rally in El Paso, Mr. Trump struck an unyielding note: "We need the wall, and it has to be built."
As a candidate, Mr. Trump rarely strayed from calling his proposed physical barrier anything other than a "wall" or a "great wall." When he mentioned other names, like "fence," it was usually to highlight what he viewed as the weaker plans of skeptics or opponents.
That changed leading up to and during the shutdown. The wall is not popular among Americans, and it is especially unpopular among Democrats. Mr. Trump started using words like "fence" and "barrier," which he had avoided as a candidate. Later, he began telling Democrats he didn't care what it was called.
Still, Mr. Trump's preferred term for the border barrier remains, simply, "the wall."
The Times identified very few instances in which Mr. Trump was specific about the wall's physical characteristics. Even its potential height -- occasionally said to be somewhere between 35 feet and 50 feet -- was mentioned rarely.
Some of the earliest details that Mr. Trump did mention: The wall would have a "beautiful door," to make sure people crossing the border did so legally. To the extent that he did discuss its composition as a candidate, he usually said his wall would be made of concrete or "precast."
Later, he began describing transparency -- the ability to see through the wall -- as a design requirement, using terms like "see-through" and "slats." About a year later, amid the shutdown and negotiations about how to end it, Mr. Trump described the wall as made of American steel:
"Only a wall, or steel barrier, will keep us safe!"

Plagiarist Jill Abramson used Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal to rise to power at New York Times

Texto completo: Jill Abramson, reeling from revelations she pilfered material for her journalism book, climbed the ladder at the New York Times with help from the paper’s worst plagiarism scandal.

When Jayson Blair, then 27, admitted he invented comments and scenes in 2003, Abramson, then Washington bureau chief, was named to a 20-person panel to determine what went wrong. Three months later, she was named managing editor as the scandal shook the paper.

But now facing a scandal of her own, Abramson, who went on to be the Times’ first female executive editor from 2011 to 2014, hasn’t been banished from polite society, unlike Blair, whose recent career moves include freelancing as a life coach in suburban Virginia.

Abramson was flummoxed by the notion she was being treated differently from Blair. “I don’t have an answer to your double standard argument,” Abramson said in an email to the Washington Examiner . “I’ve apologized for serious sourcing errors and promptly corrected them.”

Vigorously defending Abramson, Bill Keller, her former boss and predecessor as executive editor, said that "the gleeful piling on is getting to be a little creepy." He added: “I would hardly describe what Jill's going through as being ‘given a pass.' Her reputation, deservedly stellar, is under fierce attack, and, after her family, her reputation is her most prized possession. “

“As I recall, Jason was not accused of failing to attribute information, he flat-out made stuff up. Fabrication is a capital crime in journalism,” he said. “As far as I know, nobody has suggested that Jill made things up.”

Blair was accused of "widespread plagiarism and fabrication" including failing to attribute material - according to a New York Times article published two months before Keller ascended from columnist on the newspaper to executive editor.

Abramson remains listed online as a Harvard University senior lecturer. She is still a member of the elite American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the organization confirmed. Blair, on the other hand, lost his job and reputation.

Mark Feldstein, a University of Maryland journalism professor who is working on a book about journalistic malpractice, suggested that Blair's lowly status as a junior reporter and Abramson's hallowed reputation as a former New York Times executive editor, accounts for her being treated with much greater indulgence.

“There is a double standard in all of society in every endeavor, where those with more power and wealth are often held to lower standards,” he said. "There's one standard for the powerful, the wealthy, and the famous, and there's one for the rest of us."

Abramson spoke at two of Washington’s most respectable media forums this week: the Newseum on Wedneday and the National Press Club on Thursday — despite evidence that she appropriated from other sources in at least six sections of her book, Merchants of Truth: Inside the News Revolution.

The book remains on store shelves and available online, with publisher Simon & Schuster refusing to pulp copies. Abramson vowed to correct errors, but it’s unclear if there will be a second book printing and the publisher did not respond to multiple requests for information.

Abramson, ultimately fired by the Times, became the paper's No. 2 editor under Keller in the wake of the Blair scandal. She was listed as a “winner” of the scandal by the New York Post, even before her promotion.

But Feldstein, the University of Maryland professor and a former on-air reporter for CNN and ABC News, said that even fabrication gets a pass for media elites, pointing to NBC News anchor Brian Williams’ rehabilitation after the revelation he told many lies, including about being in an aircraft under attack.

“If I had done that when I was in television, I would have been gone in 24 hours, and so would almost anybody else. And I think we're seeing some of the same things with Jill Abramson,” Feldstein said.

The media’s double standard for plagiarism and related ethical misconduct, Feldstein believes, can be explained by the chumminess of society's elite, who "fraternize with each other" and feel sympathy for friends. "With some lowly person, it's easier for someone at the top who doesn't even know them to say, 'Give them the death penalty,'" he said.

University of Florida journalism professor Mindy McAdams said people are usually swiftly dismissed from reporting careers over plagiarism and related offenses because "you need to get rid of them — they can't be trusted. “

McAdams said plagiarism in a book is even more egregious than in a news article, though “in the case of a book, there's no firing to be done." She added that she was not sure Abramson would survive the scandal unscathed. I don't think we will forget this, and so far, I don't think she has offered a full and complete explanation of how those paragraphs got into her book."

Women on Money &amp; Mindset: Who’s in your personal brain trust?

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

Texto completo: [Video: "We the Animals" Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
A powerful yet tender movie about an unstable family is available on Netflix. And a reimagining of Olivia Newton-John's life airs on Lifetime.
What's Streaming
WE THE ANIMALS (2018) stream on Netflix. The documentarian Jeremiah Zagar adapts the 2011 novel by Justin Torres for his debut fiction feature, a dreamy, visceral coming-of-age story starring young nonprofessional actors. The tale is mostly seen through the eyes of Jonah (Evan Rosado), the youngest of three brothers who, as he inches toward 10, is growing up to be the more sensitive of the bunch. While his siblings start to take to their unpredictable father, Jonah breaks away into a fantasy world of his own and watches his parents' volatile relationship with caution. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis named the movie a Critic's Pick and called it "fragile yet resilient."
THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) stream on Netflix; rent on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. In hindsight, this buddy comedy can come off as crass, outdated or juvenile. But it's worth revisiting for its cast of rising stars and an endearing lead performance by a wide-eyed Steve Carell.
What's on TV
OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. When rumors surfaced that Olivia Newton-John was on her deathbed last month after her third bout of breast cancer, the 70-year-old Australian singer took to social media to cheerfully disprove the hearsay. This new biopic celebrates her decades-long career and delves into her health battles and other personal dramas. A fitting Delta Goodrem, a fellow Aussie who has recorded duets with the "Grease" star, takes the lead role. The movie comes a month before the release of Newton-John's memoir, "Don't Stop Believin."'
SUPERSOUL CONVERSATIONS 8 p.m. on OWN. Oprah Winfrey heads to Times Square for tough conversations with Beto O'Rourke, Michael B. Jordan, Bradley Cooper and others in this new special.
DEADPOOL 2 (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as a sardonic antihero in this Marvel sequel. The title character, whose real name is Wade Wilson, assembles a motley team of mutant heroes to save a young mutant (Julian Dennison) from the wrath of the half-bionic Cable (Josh Brolin). The jokes are witty -- they will go over your head if you aren't a DC or Marvel whiz -- and the fight scenes are what superhero movies are made of. But the film "takes no real creative risks," A. O. Scott wrote in his Times review. He adds: "What drives this franchise is the same force that drives so much culture and politics right now: the self-pity of a white man with a relentless need to be the center of attention."
DYNASTIES 9 p.m. on BBC America. This impressive nature documentary series wraps up with what may be its cutest episode: a look at a colony of emperor penguins preparing to raise a new generation on the coast of Antarctica. (A scene where emperor chicks learn how to walk is just delightful.)

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
►A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
►Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
►"Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: PPG TO SHUTTER AUTOMOTIVE COATINGS FACILITY IN MICHIGAN
PPG will close an automotive coatings services plant in Livonia, Mich., in June. The plant, located in a suburb of Detroit, employs 46 and layoffs could begin sooner than the closure, according to a notice the company filed with the state of Michigan. In its fourth-quarter earnings report released last month, the Downtown-based paints company said sales of automotive original coatings fell by 5 percent because of lower demand in its China and Europe markets and an overall slowdown in worldwide auto production. In a statement, PPG said the closure is "part of ongoing efforts to optimize operations and better service customers."
FOREIGN ROBO-CALLERS FACE FINES UNDER THE FCC'S PROPOSED RULES
The Federal Communications Commission is dramatically expanding its war against unwanted robo-calls by proposing rules that cover spammy text messages and fraudsters located overseas. The proposal could lead to new fines or other penalties for scammers who have escaped the reach of U.S. regulators. On average, Americans received more than 1,500 robo-calls per second in 2018, according to third-party estimates included in an FCC report accompanying the proposal Thursday. Most of the FCC's efforts to combat unwanted robo-calls have focused on domestic violators. But many Americans have found themselves at the mercy of international spammers who target hapless victims with foreign-language calls.
EFFICIENCY KILLED THE MARKET FOR AIRBUS' A380 MODEL
Since a solo flight by the Wright brothers on the shore of North Carolina more than a century ago, the size of airplanes has gone in one direction - up. But the era of ever larger jets, and the romantic idea of continent-hopping travel they inspired, came to an unofficial end with the announcement by Airbus on Thursday that it plans to cease production of the A380, the largest passenger airliner ever built. Airbus struggled to market the A380 for years and never sold one to an American carrier.

Texto completo: Rachelle Lefevre plays the leader of a law firm specializing in reversing wrongful convictions in a new Fox legal drama. And a Jordan Peele-produced Amazon series revisits Lorena Bobbitt.
What's on TV
PROVEN INNOCENT 9 p.m. on Fox. What's more satisfying than watching justice doled out from the comfort of your couch? The latest legal drama to hit television hopes that the answer is this: watching injustices be reversed. That's the premise of this new show, which stars Rachelle Lefevre as a lawyer who was once wrongfully convicted of murder and, after having her name cleared, became the leader of a law firm specializing in fighting wrongful sentences. Russell Hornsby plays her legal partner. Kelsey Grammer plays the rotten state's attorney who put Lefevre's character behind bars; he's now her main adversary in the courtroom. The series was created by Danny Strong -- one of the creators of "Empire" -- and the screenwriter David Elliot.
NBA ALL-STAR CELEBRITY GAME 7 p.m. on ESPN. Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C., is the backdrop of this year's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, which pits a "home" team of names like the actor JB Smoove, the television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz and the rapper Rhapsody against an "away" team that includes the comedians Hasan Minhaj and Amanda Seales and the singer Bad Bunny. The rapper Quavo, a member of Migos and, less prominently, last year's Celebrity Game M.V.P., will also play for the "away" team.
What's Streaming
LORENA Stream on Amazon. You probably know the story: in June 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis with a kitchen knife. The next year, she was acquitted of criminal charges, but not before she had become a media sensation and the butt of scores of jokes, which often ignored evidence that she'd been a victim of domestic violence. Now, 25 years after her acquittal, she's telling what happened on her own terms, in this new Jordan Peele-produced documentary series. "It's like they all missed or didn't care why I did what I did," Bobbitt recently told The New York Times. "This is about a victim and a survivor," she went on to say, "and this is about what's happening in our world today."
THE NOTE: SHAPING THE SOUND OF NY Stream on Red Bull TV. Alexander Rosner survived the Holocaust and became a respected sound engineer in New York during the disco boom of the '70s. He talks about his work in this short documentary, and about his latest gig: installing sound systems in churches.
PERIOD. END OF SENTENCE. (2018) Stream on Netflix. Rayka Zehtabchi's Oscar-nominated documentary short looks at the way a village in rural India is transformed by the installation of a sanitary-pad machine. Through that story, it delves into social attitudes regarding menstruation in India -- a topic also notably explored in the Indian filmmaker R. Balki's 2018 feature, "Padman," which is also streaming on Netflix.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Byron York: Eight days in May: New revelations about intrigue to remove President Trump

Texto completo: There are new revelations about what took place in Washington during the extraordinary period from May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired FBI director James Comey, to May 17, 2017 when Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed.

The short version is: The reports were true. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein really did discuss wearing a wire to secretly record the president. Rosenstein and others did discuss invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. And the FBI did adopt an aggressive new investigation strategy, targeting the president himself, almost instantly after the Comey firing.

It's all true, that is, if revelations in an upcoming book by former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe are accurate. The bottom line on that is that, at least from what we know now, McCabe's story seems consistent with information congressional investigators have been able to glean elsewhere.

"It's just like we thought all along," said one House Republican upon hearing the news. "If McCabe's account is true, it confirms what we thought, that Rod Rosenstein was serious when he talked about wearing a wire and invoking the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein should be under oath answering our questions. We need to know who was in the room and what was said."

Whether that happens, in the House at least, is up to the new Democratic majority. But Rosenstein has so far declined to answer congressional questions on the wearing-a-wire and 25th Amendment matters.

To promote his book, McCabe has done an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes." Correspondent Scott Pelley appeared on CBS Thursday morning with a preview. "There were meetings at the Justice Department at which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment," Pelley said. "These were the eight days from Comey's firing to the point that Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. And the highest levels of American law enforcement were trying to figure out what to do with the president."

As another part of his book promotion, McCabe published an excerpt Thursday morning in The Atlantic. The theme of the excerpt is that, after the Comey firing, McCabe was determined to cement in place a Trump-Russia investigation that could not be stopped by the president.

It might be more accurate to say "investigations." McCabe wrote that he ordered an "overall review" of the FBI's Trump-Russia work. "Were there individuals on whom we should consider opening new cases?" he wrote. "I want to protect the Russia investigation in such a way that whoever came after me could not just make it go away."

The New York Times reported last month that in that period, the FBI opened up a counterintelligence investigation focused on the president himself. "Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president's own actions constituted a possible threat to national security," the Times reported. "Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence."

That is one sort of investigation. The other probe McCabe wanted to nail into place was what became the Mueller investigation. Describing the decision to appoint Mueller -- the decision was actually made by Rosenstein -- McCabe wrote, "If I got nothing else done as acting director, I had done the one thing I needed to do."

And then there were the talks about secretly recording the president and using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. According to CBS, top law enforcement officials were discussing which cabinet members might be persuaded to go along with an effort to remove Trump. "They were counting noses," Pelley said on CBS Thursday morning. "They were not asking cabinet members whether they would vote for or against removing the president, but they were speculating."

Much, if not all, of what McCabe reports has been reported before. But an eyewitness, insider account lends new weight to the idea that the highest levels of the national security apparatus experienced a collective freakout in the days after the Comey firing.

In particular, it intensifies questions about Rosenstein's behavior in those eight days. Remember that Rosenstein played a key role in the removal of Comey. A few days later, he was talking about removing the president for having removed Comey. The sheer audacity of that has stunned even experienced Capitol Hill observers.

"The guy who wrote the memo providing the justification for firing Comey is then upset that the swamp is mad at him for helping fire Comey and then comes up with a plan to wear a wire and invoke the 25th Amendment," said the House Republican.

After the CBS report, the Justice Department, on Rosenstein's behalf, issued a statement saying McCabe's account was "inaccurate and factually incorrect." Rosenstein, the Department said, "never authorized any recording that Mc. McCabe references." That was not exactly a denial of the basic story that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire.

One final note. The frenzy of May 2017 set off investigations that continued previous investigations that, as far as the public knows today, have not uncovered evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to fix the 2016 election. And if those investigations have not found that proof by now, they certainly had not found it in May 2017. And yet the investigations multiplied, and are still multiplying to this day.

Texto completo: Dr. John Gunderson was training in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in the late-1960s when he encountered a “group of patients that didn't have a diagnosis, but which drove everybody crazy," he recalled in an interview that is posted on YouTube.
“For the most part, they were given psychotherapies from which they got worse," he added in the interview with Sigmund Karterud. It was a time when the term “atypical schizophrenia" was “on the margins, Dr. Gunderson said.
A few years later, while at the National Institute of Mental Health, “I had this opportunity, being a schizophrenia fellow, to try to identify who the people with atypical schizophrenia were," he said. “And that involved a literature review, called 'Defining Borderline Patients,' published in 1975."
Beginning with that work, Dr. Gunderson's studies of people with suicidal urges, fears of abandonment, and squalls of emotion helped establish borderline personality disorder as a stand-alone diagnosis, which provided a foundation for research and the first effective treatments. He was 76 when he died Jan. 11 in his Weston home of prostate cancer.
Trained in Freudian analysis, he was evaluating the effects of psychotherapy on people identified as schizophrenic in the early 1970s when he discovered that many participants in his study had received the wrong diagnosis. They did not have recurring psychoses, the signature symptom of schizophrenia, but rather a poorly understood syndrome described by the German-American psychoanalyst Adolph Stern in 1938: Their mental state was on the “border" between garden-variety neurosis and full-blown psychosis.
Studying the literature on borderline patients, Dr. Gunderson distilled defining features such as intense fears of being alone, floods of emotional turmoil, and impulsive self-harming, like cutting. While working at McLean Hospital in Belmont, He collaborated with Margaret T. Singer on the influential 1975 paper, “Defining Borderline Patients: An Overview," which turned a collection of descriptive accounts into a firm diagnosis. He also developed a diagnostic interview that set the standard for identifying the disorder, bringing focus to what had been a baffling condition.
“The way these patients were described before was as treatment failures, as if it was somehow their fault," Dr. Lois Choi-Kain, director of the Adult Borderline Center and Training Institute at McLean, told The New York Times. “John came along and said no, these are symptoms of the disorder, not failures."
The 1975 paper and others provided a foundation for research into borderline disorder that had not previously existed, clearing the way for its inclusion as a full stand-alone diagnosis in the landmark third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatry's encyclopedia of mental disorders, published in 1980.
Dr. Gunderson was recruited in 1973 to work at McLean and spent much of his career at the Belmont hospital. In 1996, he published another analysis, “The Borderline Patient's Intolerance of Aloneness: Insecure Attachments and Therapist Availability," which provided doctors and patients with an X-ray of the condition's internal emotional terrain.
“Being alone is often intolerable to them because it is associated with a profound sense of being bad or evil," he wrote, “a self-image distortion accompanied by such intense feelings of guilt or shame that the question of worthiness to live often follows."
Over the years, Dr. Gunderson was adamant that psychiatric drugs did not help resolve borderline symptoms. He favored talk therapies, including what is known as dialectical behavior therapy, an approach developed by the University of Washington psychologist Marsha Linehan.
He also published, with Dr. Paul Links, a handbook describing what he called good psychiatric management, intended for nonspecialists, patients, and families dealing with the storms of rage and self-loathing of borderline personality. This guide became widely used by doctors.
Dr. Gunderson's long commitment to people with borderline personality disorder had a hopeful payoff. He collaborated on a long-term study, led by Mary C. Zanarini, a Harvard Medical School psychology professor who is director of McLean's Laboratory for the Study of Adult Development. Their research found that most people given a diagnosis of borderline personality eventually recover: some 15 percent in the first year, a third by two years, fully 85 percent after a decade.
“He was the first person to look systematically at the data and figure out what the heck this diagnosis really meant," Dr. Glen Gabbard, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, told the Times. “Before John, there were observations, case studies, confusion; after John, we had clarity."
In a long essay reflecting on his career, Dr. Gunderson returned repeatedly to the intensely personal, often uncertain craft that drew him to psychiatry in the first place.
“My life in psychiatry has provided me with access to people's deepest feelings, their most private secrets, and to the responsibilities of being entrusted by such access," he concluded. “At these times you are like a priest, parent, or best friend as much as a doctor."
John Gunder Gunderson was born in Two Rivers, Wis., the youngest of three children. His father, Sherman, was a professor of economics, and his mother, Alma Walter, was a high school English teacher. He grew up in Oshkosh and graduated from high school in 1960.
Determined to become a doctor, he entered Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where he found that everyone else seemed to be pre-med, too, and appeared better prepared. He stuck it out, earning his way into a two-year Dartmouth Medical School program that fed Harvard's medical school, where he finished his degree in 1967.
In 1963, while at Dartmouth, he met Susan Riley, a Skidmore College student, on a blind date. They married in 1965. In addition to his wife, Dr. Gunderson leaves two children, Craig and Kelly, and five grandchildren.
After completing an internship in Minneapolis, Dr. Gunderson did his residency at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston and received training as an analyst at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. He joined Harvard Medical School in 1973 and retired last year as professor emeritus, seeing patients throughout his tenure there.
In the interview with Karterud, Dr. Gunderson said treating borderline patients “required that I listen to things which I would not have heard or would not have wanted to hear. And like the Grinch, my heart grew a bit larger because of this."
His interest in and understanding of such challenging patients “changed as a result of my work," he said, adding: “I can't say for sure, but I think that it's made me a more benevolent person."

Texto completo: Spoiler alert! This story contains details from "The Masked Singer" Season 1, Episode 7, including the identity of the eliminated celebrity.
These singers fighting to stay hidden.
Wednesday's episode of Fox hit "The Masked Singer" revealed another celebrity this week as the final six competitors – Peacock, Monster, Bee, Alien, Rabbit and Lion – put on their best performances.
Monster kicked off the show with a soulful rendition of Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' "I Love Rock 'n' Roll," after revealing he grew up "down South. " The judges were blown away by his performance. Robin Thicke called the furry creature his "favorite," throwing out a guess of "In Living Color" alum Tommy Davidson. Jenny McCarthy thinks it's Lil Jon, while guest judge J. B. Smoove thinks it’s boxer Mike Tyson after the monster said he’s "stepping back into the ring. "
The Monster's moment of truth: He was not on "In Living Color. " Sorry Robin.

Next up was the Lion, who brought the house down with Lady Gaga's "Diamond Heart. " "She always delivers every single week," McCarthy said. She guessed the fierce competitor is a member of a girl group because the lion previously said she's "separating herself from the pack. " McCarthy's final guess: Spice Girl Mel B or a member of Destiny's Child. Nicole Scherzinger thinks it may be "True Grit" actress Hailee Steinfeld.
Lion's moment of truth: "I have a subscription to a monthly murder-mystery game. " McCarthy replied, "Who doesn't?"
Alien gave an out-of-this-world performance of Elle King “Ex’s & Oh's. " "I feel like every week you're stepping up your game," Scherzinger said, while Thicke added that "this is the trickiest one for me. " McCarthy guessed it's either Nicole or Sofia Richie because the alien claims to be from a famous family. Ken Jeong guessed Paula Abdul because of an earlier snake reference. Scherzinger pointed out that La Toya Jackson had a pet snake.
Alien's hint: "I have been on The New York Times Best Seller list twice. "
Bee took us back in time with Tina Turner’s "What's Love Got to Do with It. " "You are obviously a living legend and we are honored to have you on the show," Thicke said, before guessing Gladys Knight. However, the Bee dropped several song titles that confused the judges before taking the stage. McCarthy and Scherzinger agreed it could be Patti LaBelle or Anita Baker, while Jeong thinks it's Turner herself.
Bee's moment of truth: "I have 10 Grammys. " Maybe the judges are on to something.
Rabbit kept things hopping along with a circus-themed performance of Stevie Wonder’s "Isn’t She Lovely. " He accompanied his vocals with choreography that convinced the judges he's a true performer. "He’s a boy-bander for sure," McCarthy said. Nicole agreed, guessing 'N Sync members J. C. Chasez or Joey Fatone. McCarthy even guessed it might be her husband, New Kids on the Block's Donnie Wahlberg: "He hasn’t answered the phone every time Bunny is on stage!"
Rabbit's moment of truth revealed he has "17 tattoos on my body. " When asked if that helps, McCarthy replied, "None of this does. "
Peacock was the last to take the stage, singing the Weeknd’s "Can’t Feel My Face. " "You always find a way to make us laugh and make us smile," Thicke said, pointing to his showbiz background. Smoove thinks it's Wayne Brady because of his Las Vegas residency, while McCarthy guessed Neil Patrick Harris or Donny Osmond.
Peacock's final clue was that he's had his face tattooed on someone's body. *scratches head*
In the end, it was Alien who was sent packing and ordered to unmask. The judges final guesses? McCarthy picked Sofia Richie, Scherzinger selected La Toya Jackson, Jeong thought Paula Abdul, Smoove guessed Carmen Electra and Thicke also picked Jackson.
When the mask comes off it's … drum roll please … La Toya Jackson. The singer revealed that she signed on for the show because "people have a tendency to prejudge you … and they compare you to other people in your family. So I wanted to do it and see how far I'd go. "
Jackson, the older sister of icon Michael Jackson, joins unmasked singers talk show-host Ricki Lake (Raven); actress Tori Spelling (Unicorn); comedian Margaret Cho (Poodle); former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports commentator Terry Bradshaw (Deer); comedian Tommy Chong (Pineapple); and Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown (Hippo).
"The Masked Singer" is now moving into the semifinals next week, where two singers will be unmasked for the first time ever.

Don't make it easy for Trump to hide his failure; Op-ed

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's regular threats to close down parts of the government to vindicate an applause line make you almost nostalgic for the shutdowns of the past.
When Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed the government to a 16-day halt in 2013 in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, at least he was fighting over something that mattered.
I said "almost" about that nostalgia because the closure Cruz championed was, from the beginning, a doomed tactical ploy for a wrongheaded objective. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Cruz's gambit "a toddler's version of legislating."
That Trump's fixation over a useless border wall looks even more juvenile than a preschooler's tantrum explains why Republicans, including McConnell, finally said "Enough!" to a president they had been coddling for fear of retaliation and in the pursuit of conservative dominance over the federal judiciary. This time, they told him he had to surrender his wall-funding dreams.
But the Republicans did not come to this realization entirely of their own accord. A little over a month ago, the same McConnell said he would not bring budget legislation to the floor that he knew the president would veto. The result was the wrenching 35-day shutdown.
McConnell did not reckon with the impact of Democratic control of the House of Representatives. With power in her hands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, refused to accommodate a presidential objective they knew was phony and, worse, racist in its underlying motivation. This is why Pelosi (to much hand-wringing) called the wall "immoral."
The president's proclivity to tweet or talk without much reflection was helpful on this front too. On Sunday, he picked up on a Gallup Poll suggesting, as Trump put it, that "Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans." He added: "This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!"
So we know it's "Latin Americans" in general and not just those "criminals" he talks about whom Trump sees as the grave danger. And, by the way, the compromise spending bill shows that Democrats have no interest in "open borders."
Trump's lost mojo with Senate Republicans creates a new playing field. Republicans can see what a 2020 thumping would look like in the nearly 10-million-vote margin Democrats won in the 2018 House races.
They also learned from the price they paid for the last shutdown that they will be blamed for the president's shenanigans.
Meanwhile, Trump shows no signs of backing down from his fantasy approach to public communications. He updated his "Build the Wall!" slogan into "Finish the Wall!" as if he has achieved something he has not.
Noting Trump's recent statement that "we're building a lot of wall," The New York Times calmly reported on Tuesday: "In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017."
But Democrats need to learn lessons from all this, too. First, they should stay tough. Second, they need to be disciplined.
This episode shows that standing up to Trump's worst instincts will pay rewards. Democrats forced Senate Republicans into a very old-fashioned conference committee that reached a budget deal in a very old-fashioned way because the legislators were operating in a largely Trump-free zone. This only happened because Democrats resisted calls to play Trump's game.
"Comity" and "civility" are never achieved by capitulating to bullying and hostage-taking.
At the same time, the GOP, including Trump, is already signaling that its main goal is to pick up on the most adventurous proposals from Democratic legislators - and any reckless or offensive statements from individual Democrats - to pretend that Republicans are, against the evidence of the last two years, a mainstream bunch.
Dealing with this issue is much trickier. For the long run, it's useful for progressive Democrats to push the boundaries of the policy debate. But they should leave the incendiary tweets to Trump, keep the focus on his extremism, and legislate in areas where their party is united - political reform, voting rights, repairs to the health care system, protections for the Dreamers, and infrastructure.
Successful parties manage to do more than one thing at the same time. To keep the initiative, the Democrats need to show that they can master this essential political art.

Trump upgraded Obama's White House golf simulator. Wait, how are we only now learning about this simulator?

Texto completo: President Trump personally paid to upgrade a “golf simulator” originally installed in the White House by former President Barack Obama, according to an anonymously sourced Washington Post report.

I have so many questions.

First, was the bowling alley not good enough?

Second, and more seriously, why are we only now learning about the White House’s “golf simulator”? Good on the Post for reporting Trump spent nearly $50,000 of his own money to improve the program, but the man who originally installed the simulator has been out of office for going on three years. This means that the system has been around for even longer than that. Thank God for elected Republicans. If not for them, I guess we’d never hear about government excess or the laziness of our elected officials.

But that brings us to the third question, which is: Why, exactly, is this report being portrayed as a story of excess and waste when it’s actually about the president using his own money to update a system that was installed before he took office?

Here’s how the Post reports on the golf simulator [emphases added]:

"President Trump has installed a room-sized “golf simulator” game at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds at courses all over the world by hitting a ball into a large video screen, according to two people told about the system.
That system replaced an older, less sophisticated golf simulator that had been installed under President Obama, according to two people with knowledge of the previous system .
Trump’s system cost about $50,000, and was put in during the last few weeks in a room in his personal quarters, a White House official said.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the president’s private residence, said Trump had paid for the new system and the installation personally .
But here’s what the Post says in its headline: “President Trump installed a room-sized golf simulator at White House.”

And here’s how the paper is selling the story on social media: “President Trump installed a room-sized golf simulator at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds by hitting a ball into a large video screen. It was put in his personal quarters but sits unused … ”

The paper’s social media team has followed up with some fairly pertinent context, tweeting, “It replaces an older, less sophisticated golf simulator that had been installed under President Obama. Trump’s system cost about $50,000, which he paid for personally … .”

Naturally, members of the news media took their cues from the Post’s tweets, responding dutifully with additional commentary suggesting that Trump is wasteful, lazy, and wholly responsible for the stupid golf simulator.

“WHO AMONG US, MAN?” asked New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers.

Well, former President Obama, for one. Or was that not intended as a serious question?

CNN's Manu Raju said, "In the past several weeks, "Trump hasn’t played as much golf as he’s used to – but not to worry since he’s installed a ‘room-sized’ golf simulator at WH. The cost: $50K. Meanwhile, executive time consists of 60% of his schedule.”

The Daily Beast’s Sam Stein even managed to work in a shot at right-leaning news organizations, tweeting, “The good news for Trump is that it’s not like conservative media spent years throwing a tantrum that Obama played golf.”

Interesting thought. Conservative news media most certainly would have lost its mind over the Obama golf simulator — had anyone bothered to report on it during any of the eight years he was in office.

Rolling Stone’s Washington bureau chief Andy Kroll complained, “If Obama had done this, Fox and the right-wing echo chamber would be going ballistic and cover it non-stop for days.”

Oops — it helps to read past the headline!

I'm glad this story was reported, but we shouldn't have to elect a Republican president just to find out what's going on in the White House.

Ryan Adams emotionally abused women in his life, sexted with a teen girl, says New York Times

Texto completo: Seven women and more than a dozen associates have accused singer-songwriter Ryan Adams of dangling career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex, including an underage girl with whom he had phone sex and exchanged graphic texts, according to the New York Times.
Adams, 44, who the Times described as "equal parts punk-rock folk hero and romantic troubadour," comes off as a manipulative boor in the Times' reporting, someone who championed upcoming female artists, especially young ones, and promised career advancement while also pursuing them for sex.
If he didn't get his way, he would sometimes "turn domineering and vengeful, jerking away his offers of support when spurned, and subjecting women to emotional and verbal abuse, and harassment in texts and on social media," the Times reported Wednesday.
Late Wednesday, Adams released a statement through his lawyer, emailed to USA TODAY.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false.
"I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I though was underage. Period. "
The Times said the accounts of Adams' alleged behavior were corroborated by family members or friends of the women who were present at the time, as well as by correspondence from Adams reviewed by the paper.

Especially troubling was the accusation that Adams had an inappropriate online relationship with a teenage girl that began with graphic texting and moved on to video calls on Skype where Adams exposed himself during phone sex.
The paper reviewed more than 3,200 texts Adams exchanged with a girl they called Ava, who is now 20 but was 15 and 16 during a nine-month period they had an online relationship. They never met in person.
In the texts, Adams questioned Ava about her age, and she sometimes lied and said she was older than she was. He didn't seem convinced, the paper reported, but their sexual conversations continued. “i would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this,” Adams wrote to her in November 2014.
A constant theme in their off-and-on exchanges was fretting about her age, mixed with explicit talk about his desire to touch her body parts, the Times reported.
Adams is denying these accusations, according to his lawyer, Andrew Brettler, a member of a major celebrity legal firm in Los Angeles. Brettler told the Times the singer did not recall these exchanges with Ava, and if she had been underage, he didn't know it.
“Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage,” Brettler said.
The Times said laws covering sexually explicit communication with a minor vary from state to state and are separate from age-of-consent laws, which involve physical contact.
In Ohio, where Ava lived, it’s a felony to solicit, exchange or possess any content that shows a minor under 18 engaging in sexual activity. In New York, where Adams was during some of his exchanges with Ava, there are similar laws regarding children younger than 17. Federal statutes use 18 as the age of adulthood. The Times quoted legal experts who said that prosecuting such cases involves disputes over jurisdiction and whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age.
As for the "extremely serious and outlandish" accusations by the adult women, Brettler said Adams doesn't have the power to make or break careers. The lawyer said Adams believes some of the allegations are “grousing by disgruntled individuals” who blamed Adams for personal or professional disappointments and were now out to harm him.
The Times report is another in a series of reports that have spurred the #MeToo movement to call out sexual misconduct across multiple industries, especially in media and entertainment. So far, not many music stars have been among the named and shamed, probably because few people expect rock stars to be Boy Scouts.
"But many in the business say that harassment and inequitable treatment of women is pervasive and that the 'sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll' ethos has shielded men from being held to account," the Times reported.

According to the Times, Adams became a solo star in the early 2000s, with the album "Heartbreaker" and songs like "New York, New York," at the same time he was bedeviled with notorious addiction and mental health issues.
He was an "early adopter" in reaching out directly to his audience via social media, and used Twitter and Instagram to scout and meet female artists. "It was on Twitter that he found Ava, who excitedly messaged him to say hello after she followed him and he followed her back.
“I was really alone,” Ava told the Times, “and he was really friendly and cool. ”
The Times named some of the women it interviewed, including Phoebe Bridgers and Courtney Jaye, two musicians who were initially beguiled by Adams' energy and enthusiasm for their career prospects. But they were shaken after he became obsessive and abusive in pursuit of sex. Two other female singer-songwriters described similar patterns but were not identified.
Adams' ex-wife, singer and actress Mandy Moore ("This is Us"), said Adams exploited and then stifled female artists' ambitions. “Music was a point of control for him,” Moore said. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s. " They divorced in 2016.
Megan Butterworth, Adams’s ex-fiancee, also described him to the Times as controlling and emotionally abusive. During their relationship, he isolated her socially and professionally, she said, and could turn so angry he would smash things and physically intimidate her, though he never hit her.
When she left him in 2018, Butterworth said, he inundated her with hundreds of text messages, phone calls and emails that shifted between emotional pleas and vitriol, and threats of suicide and lawsuits.
The Times reported that in the last few months, Moore and several others who said they were scarred by their relationships with Adams have found one another, creating a support system and speaking out in hopes of protecting others.
"What you experience with him – the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back-and-forth behavior – feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this. ”
In his statement, Ryan said he was saddened by what the women in his past life said, and promised to do better.
"As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he said. "I am resolved to work to be the best man I can be. And I wish everyone compassion, understanding and healing. ”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
►A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
►Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
►"Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

False Claim On El Paso, Repeated In El Paso

Texto completo: What was said
"I've been hearing a lot of things: 'Oh the wall didn't make that much of a difference.' You know where it made a big difference? Right here in El Paso."
False.
Mr. Trump is repeating his widely debunked claim made in his State of the Union address that El Paso transformed from "one of the most dangerous cities" into one of the safest cities in the United States after the construction of barriers at the border.
El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the country. It has had a consistently lower crime rate than the average among more than 20 similarly sized cities, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In that group, El Paso reported the second-lowest violent crime rate in 2008 -- before the construction of border fencing. And after the barrier was completed, it held the rank while the violent crime rate did not change considerably.
The inaccurate claim has also drawn the rebuke of Democratic and Republican local politicians alike, including Beto O'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, and the Republican mayor of the city.
"I don't care if the mayor is a Democrat or a Republican, they are full of crap when they say the border barrier didn't help lower the crime rate," Mr. Trump said, again adding falsely, "It didn't stay the same. It went way down."
What Was Said
"If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country."
This is disputed.
Before Mr. Trump took the stage, lawmakers in Washington reached a tentative deal on border security that included funding for physical barriers at the border and the reduction of detention space for migrants.
Democrats had sought to limit the number of detention beds under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arguing that limiting the beds would force the agency to prioritize migrants with serious criminal records. Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, said a reduction in the number of beds would mean the release of criminals.
Whether or not ICE would be forced to released hardened criminals is a prediction that cannot be fact checked, but available data suggests that most immigrants in detention have not committed serious crimes. Records obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University show that in June 2018, for example, ICE held more than 44,000 migrants in detention facilities across the country. Of these migrants, 58 percent had no criminal conviction and 21 percent had committed minor offenses such as traffic violations or illegal entry while 18 percent had been convicted of serious crimes.
ICE has disputed that breakdown but used a broader measure for its figures: The agency said 54 percent of detained immigrants had criminal records or faced pending charges, though it did not specify what crimes they were accused of committing.
What was said
"So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good."
This is exaggerated.
Mr. Trump overestimated his crowd size and severely understated the number of people who attended a dueling rally held Monday night by Beto O'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman.
A spokesman with the fire department told the El Paso Times that the arena Mr. Trump spoke at was filled to capacity at 6,500 people. Thousands more watched the rally outside, with a possible total attendance of 10,000, the spokesman said, noting that the department did not officially estimate the crowd outside.
Estimates for Mr. O'Rourke's crowd have been far higher than 200 or 300, ranging from 7,000 to 15,000.
What was said
"I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax?"
This is misleading.
Several Democrats have introduced proposals to increase taxes, but unless the 6,500 people in the room were all among the wealthiest Americans, they would not be affected by these proposed tax hikes.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York, suggested a top marginal tax rate of 60 or 70 percent incomes over $10 million. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for president, has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent over $1 billion. And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed an a top estate tax rate of 77 percent on inheritances over $1 billion.
For context, households in the top 5 percent earned an average income of $385,289 in 2017, according to the Census Bureau.
What was said
"I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of let's hop a train to California, of you're not allowed to own cows anymore."
This is exaggerated.
Mr. Trump was referring to the Green New Deal, a proposal to combat climate change released by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.
In its current form, the plan is a broad outline, introduced as a nonbinding congressional resolution, and proposes projects like expanding renewable power sources, upgrading energy grids and buildings, working with farmers and ranchers to reform the agricultural sector, and investing in clean transportation and high speed rail. The legislation emphasizes that it intends to meet these goals "as much as is technologically feasible."
Though the Green New Deal would significantly alter the transportation and agriculture sectors, it does not call for the elimination of cars, airplanes or cows.
Outside the text of the legislation, however, a blog post on Ms. Ocasio Cortez's website describing the plan did note, "The Green New Deal sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren't sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then."
Her staff has since said retracted the post and said that it was incomplete and published by accident.
What was said
"You can keep your doctor -- remember that? Twenty-eight times, that didn't happen. Turned out to be a lie. Hey, where are the fact checkers?"
This is misleading.
When President Barack Obama encouraged lawmakers to pass the Affordable Care Act during his first term, he repeatedly promised that consumers would be able to keep their doctor or health care plan under the new insurance system.
Contrary to Mr. Trump's suggestions, fact checkers and news outlets have called out Mr. Obama for failing to fulfill that pledge. The Washington Post noted in 2009 that the claim "would not necessarily be true." Factcheck.org wrote in 2009 that the promise would not apply to everyone. PolitiFact awarded Mr. Obama its Lie of the Year, its annual selection of the most egregious falsehood, in 2013. And The New York Times called it a "broken promise" in a 2013 article on the front page.
OTHER CLAIMS
In addition, Mr. Trump repeated at least eight other claims The New York Times has previously checked:
■ He exaggerated when he claimed that he had presided over an "economic miracle." (The strong economy is a continuation of trends that began before Mr. Trump took office.)
■ He falsely claimed that terminally ill patients could not get access to experimental drugs before he signed a "Right to Try" law. (A similar federal program had existed for decades before Mr. Trump signed the law last summer.)
■ He claimed that the United States was "now the number one producer of oil and natural gas." (This has been the case since 2013.)
■ He misleadingly claimed that lawmakers had been trying to pass Veterans Choice for four decades. (Though Mr. Trump has presided over reforms to the program, Veterans Choice was signed into law under President Barack Obama.)
■ He falsely claimed the government "couldn't fire anybody" before he signed a Veterans Affairs Accountability Act. (He signed a law that would make it easier to remove bad employees, but the department had been able to fire people before.)
■ He falsely accused Hillary Clinton and Democrats of colluding with Russia. (There is no evidence of this.)
■ He claimed that immigration officials had made 266,000 arrests of unauthorized immigrants who had committed crimes like murder, sexual assault and kidnapping. (The most common offenses were immigration, traffic and drug violations.)
■ He falsely claimed that only 2 percent of arrested unauthorized immigrants return for court hearings. (The accurate figure is about 72 percent.)

Texto completo: Earlier this month, in an effort to slow down legislation to legalize marijuana in Illinois, Catholic bishops spoke out against the proposal.
Citing marijuana's addictive qualities, its status as a "gateway" toward the use of more serious illegal substances, its links to mental health problems by heavy users and the danger of commercializing the sale of such a potent substance, the religious leaders issued a broad appeal.
"The Catholic bishops of Illinois are committed to the common good and therefore advise against legalization," they said.
What was instructive about the bishops' action is not their announcement, but the short-shrift response to it by legalization advocates. They ignored the bishops' concerns, dismissing them as a bunch of hopelessly un-hip fuddy-duddies who don't deserve to have their concerns taken seriously.
"Prohibitionists are going to prohibit. It just doesn't surprise me that they want to cling to the old ways. I don't know that anybody's going to be surprised by this," responded state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat and one of the leading advocates of legalization in the Legislature.
Cassidy's response was textbook.
In politics, those who are explaining are losing -- the rule is always attack and never defend.
That's one reason why legalization advocates simply wrote off their opponents as having nothing useful to contribute -- to them, the naysayers are hopelessly out of touch with the real world in which marijuana is not just benign, but a positive good.
All suggestions to the contrary are simply myths from an era that has come and, thankfully, is now gone.
That what's-the-problem mind-set reflects the current political atmosphere in which Illinois legislators will address the legalization issue.
The possession of small amounts of marijuana is a decriminalized, fine-only offense in Illinois, as it is in most states. No one goes to jail anymore simply for smoking weed.
Further, marijuana is available in Illinois by prescription as medicine for a variety of ailments, even though it has never passed muster in Food & Drug Administration medical trials. Legislators, not doctors, made that call.
New governor -- J.B. Pritzker -- says marijuana legalization is one of his top legislative priorities.
As the son of a woman who died from the consequences of alcoholism, he is unconcerned about introducing another powerful intoxicant fully into society. He considers legalization the moral thing to do and is gaga over the potential tax revenues he anticipates from legalization.
Nonetheless, dissenters persist.
In January, representatives of the law enforcement and mental health communities in Chicago warned of a variety of negative consequences stemming from legalization.
Shortly thereafter, Illinois U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin expressed similar sentiments, citing concerns about more people driving under the influence of marijuana and suffering negative mental health consequences.
"We've got to take care that we don't go to the other extreme" of full legalization, Durbin said.
But few are interested in the warnings, as a chorus of Durbin critics made clear in the aftermath of his remarks.
Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson is used to skeptical responses -- and worse -- to suggestions that marijuana is more dangerous than legalization proponents acknowledge.
As the author of a recent book on the subject -- "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence" -- Berenson has been the target of critics who assert he's just another anti-marijuana hysteric whose reporting cannot be trusted.
That description is false.
Berenson cites multiple studies showing that the heavy use of marijuana over time can lead to psychotic episodes or full schizophrenia in vulnerable people. They include young people whose brains are not mature, as well as those who are susceptible to mental illness.
He said heavy marijuana users between 14 and 19 can be subject to psychotic breaks in future years -- ages 19 to 24 for men and 21 to 27 for women.
He described individuals who can use marijuana without concern as being over 25 and mentally healthy.
Berenson's book includes a slew of good points to make, but his arguments are the functional equivalent of spitting into the wind. He acknowledged that most people have made up their minds that, at worst, marijuana is benign and that "changing someone's mind is next to impossible."

Texto completo: A pioneering Montana author who grew up on the Grant-Kohrs Ranch in Deer Lodge died Saturday in Los Angeles, Calif.
Patricia Nell Warren, 82, is best known for her 1974 sports novel "The Front Runner," the first gay novel in modern times to achieve commercial success and earn a place on the New York Times bestseller list.
"When I wrote the novel, I didn't think of it as a 'gay love story' or a gay' anything. The story came to me as something broader and deeper and more personal," Warren wrote. "Hopefully, the story of Harlan's inner battle, his defeats and his victories, would spark the sympathies of as many people as possible."
Her character Harlan is a crusty ex-Marine because she wanted "to confront readers with the inner reality of such a man because I know they exist."
Warren came out as a lesbian shortly after the novel's debut, LGBTQ Nation reported.
Warren, born in Helena, also was an activist and Reader's Digest editor.
Gregory Hinton described her book as "the best-known gay novel ever written." He introduced her at the OutWrite! Lambda Literary Awards event in West Hollywood in 2013.
"Patricia and I share the same mother and her name is Montana. Patricia was born and grew up on the historic Grant-Kohrs ranch at Deer Lodge, now a national historic site," he said. "Patricia's passion for writing came naturally. Her family had a strong oral tradition that included lots of storytelling at the dinner table."
Warren's first novel, "The Last Centennial," is set in a small Montana town.
"It would have been easier, and far more lucrative, to pen stories about Jack and Jill, but instead we have steadfastly written about Jill and Janet or Jack and Joe," Hinton said.
Hinton escorted Warren to Bozeman Pride and saw a young man, "18 if he was a day," pump her hand and thank her for changing his life with "The Front Runner."
"Behind him, a mature Yellowstone Park Ranger, who leaning in, grasped her hand, emotionally whispering, 'thank you for changing my life,'" Hinton said.
Montanan Patricia Nell Warren wrote "The Front Runner."

Texto completo: A beloved 1990s movie gets a new TV adaptation on BET. And an absurd anthology series debuts on TBS.
What's on TV
BOOMERANG 10 p.m. on BET. The screenwriter Lena Waithe ("Master of None") gives the 1992 romantic comedy "Boomerang" the television treatment. The movie stars Eddie Murphy as Marcus, a womanizing advertising executive who ends up in a love triangle between his boss, Jacqueline (Robin Givens), and a co-worker, Angela (Halle Berry). Set in the present, this new series imagines the lives of Marcus and Angela's daughter (Tetona Jackson) and Jacqueline's son (Tequan Richmond), 20-somethings trying to make it in the advertising industry in Atlanta. "Even if you've never seen the movie, you can appreciate the show and see the subtle nuances through which we pay tribute to the original," Waithe said in a recent interview with The New York Times. She added: "But we are also trying to create our own lane."
THE MANY LIVES OF NICK BUONICONTI (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. In the 1970s, the football player Nick Buoniconti led the Miami Dolphins; retired and became a lawyer and sports agent; and began hosting HBO's "Inside the N.F.L." with Len Dawson. In 1985, his focus shifted when his son, Marc, suffered a spinal cord injury while playing college football that left him quadriplegic. Since then, Buoniconti has become an outspoken activist for research into spinal cord and brain injuries. This new portrait depicts the accomplished athlete, from his early days as a "ferocious fighter" to his later years as a philanthropist.
MIRACLE WORKERS 10:30 p.m. on TBS. Based on the novel "What in God's Name," by Simon Rich, this new limited series stars Daniel Radcliffe as Craig, an underpaid angel tasked with fulfilling prayers. When his boss, God (Steve Buscemi), decides that Earth is no longer worth his time, Craig and another angel, Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan), work to prevent its destruction by achieving a true miracle: helping two socially awkward people fall in love.
What's Streaming
BOY MEETS GIRL on Britbox. This short-lived series made waves in Britain when it premiered on BBC Two for casting Rebecca Root ("The Danish Girl"), a transgender actress, in a lead role. She plays Judy, a middle-aged transgender woman who falls for a much younger man, Leo (Harry Hepple). The first season focuses on the reaction of Leo's family to his new relationship, but when that story line ended there was not much left to work with: The show got the ax after just two seasons.
THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This classic comedy, born out of "Saturday Night Live" skits, follows two brothers (Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi) who get their band back together to raise $5,000 to keep the orphanage they were born in from being sold. Watch for over-the-top car chases and cameos by musicians like James Brown, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.

Texto completo: Here are more responses to a letter from Kimberly Probolus, " A Woman's Plea: Let's Raise Our Voices !," urging more women to contribute to opinion pages.
To the Editor:
Thank you for your invitation to women to write more letters and comments. The encouragement is welcome.
Every challenge and endeavor in my life has never been mine alone. I have always tried very hard to prove my worth in comparison to males, because I represent my entire gender. I think a lot of women feel the same responsibility. If I fail, women fail. If I lose to a man, women everywhere lose to him, too.
That is why we are underrepresented in your pages, and in politics, technology, finance and mathematics. These traditionally male spaces are where our achievements count the most, and where we are least welcome. The hostility is real and palpable. When Hillary Clinton lost the election, women lost, and the humiliation was amplified by the fact that we lost to a buffoon.
Anything I do is never just for me. It is always for women, and perceived to be against men. There is simply more at stake for us, so we weigh our odds carefully.
You invite us to speak. We challenge you to listen.
Andrea Jones
Colorado Springs
To the Editor:
I have had the great fun of writing to a number of reputable publications for over 20 years. In all that time, it never once crossed my mind that a letter of mine was turned down because my name is Margaret. I assumed, correctly I'm sure, that the letter either didn't suit that day's page or it wasn't very good to begin with.
The interesting question about letters pages "scribblers" is not what their gender is but what is their average age, men and women. You will find that most of us are old geezers, retired and/or our children are grown and have left home. We are not racing off in the morning and have time to formulate and submit our two cents, for what it's worth, which is probably just that.
For the record, I do not want a letter of mine taken because my name is Margaret. Please. There would be no joy in it.
Margaret McGirr
Greenwich, Conn.
To the Editor:
Like Kimberly Probolus, I encourage more women to write more letters to the editor. But I would also like to encourage men to write fewer letters to the editor.
Having had over 20 letters published in The Times, I will never submit another one. I'm sure that almost nothing I have to say can't be said better by another person -- preferably one who is female.
Richard Grayson
Brooklyn
To the Editor:
My best friend, Joyce, and I were young teenagers 50-odd years ago when we wrote an indignant letter to The Baltimore Sun, chastising them for a negative review of a concert by the British rock group Herman's Hermits. I think we said something about The Sun's having been less than hospitable to our "visitors from abroad."
What I do remember to this day is the pleasure of seeing our letter in print. Every time The Sun or The Times or my college alumni magazine has published one of my letters, I -- a lifelong reader and admirer of writers -- have had a little thrill of feeling myself, in however small and fleeting a way, to be an author.
So, girls and women of all ages, take pen or keyboard or phone in hand and respond prolifically to The Times's request for your letters. All topics, all the time.
Leslie Pollack
Bethany, Conn.
To the Editor:
Your question is why more women don't write letters to the editor. Often, when a group of people is oppressed, the onus of blame is placed on them without searching for the root of the problem -- the system that oppressed them. Perhaps then we could reframe the question: What could major publications, like yours, be doing to discourage women from writing?
As a woman, I can give one possible answer: representation. There seem to be a disproportionate amount of male editors and writers on the staff of The New York Times. Sometimes when I read, I feel that my stories are being told by someone else. It makes me wonder if my words as a woman will be valued.
Throughout my day, whether or not my perspective as a woman will be valued is a constant question I have to ask myself. So I have to pick and choose carefully where I offer my words, because, frankly, I don't have the time to constantly fight. We have to fight to speak, always. Is your publication showing us you're listening?
Nell Becker
Brooklyn
To the Editor:
I'm a senior in high school and editor in chief of my school newspaper. I remorsefully acknowledge that even the women of my generation continue to lack the full confidence to speak out for what they believe in. While my male classmates will unapologetically make controversial (and often politically incorrect) statements in class, my female peers are less prone to taking unpopular positions. Although my school is remarkably progressive and the girls in my grade dominate leadership positions, girls are also far more aware of how others perceive their reputations.
We've been taught to stay within invisible boundaries that mark the limit of our acceptable opinions. I've witnessed my female classmates subconsciously mold their beliefs to match those of overarching consensuses. Personally, I've had to teach myself to welcome dissent.
If the percentage of Op-Eds and letters to the editor from women is to change, girls need to be taught to be less self-conscious and afraid of backlash. We need to be just as bold and unapologetic as we are strong. Only then can we fully utilize our voices.
Sabrina Chwalek
Los Angeles
To the Editor:
I would like to highlight the work of the Op-Ed Project, an organization devoted to bringing the voices of women and other underrepresented groups to the opinion pages of national newspapers. As a participant in one of its workshops in 2017, I joined a room full of women discussing our original ideas and opinions. For once we heard the unequivocal message: "What you have to say matters." We then learned strategies to frame our opinions in order to get them into print.
I encourage any woman moved by Kimberly Probolus's letter to seek out the Op-Ed Project, and I encourage established writers to serve as mentors. The organization's mentorship program was instrumental in helping me publish an Op-Ed in a national newspaper.
Christine Henneberg
Napa, Calif.
To the Editor:
So women are statistically underrepresented in letters and choose to write more about "education, health, gender and children." So what? By defining the "gender disparity problem" as a nail, The Times reaches for a hammer. By setting a goal -- a quota -- The Times has abandoned all precepts of fairness.
Why can't the selection of letters be like auditions for musicians, who audition blind from behind a screen? Wasn't it women musicians who demanded these blind auditions, and hasn't their merit been recognized from behind the screens?
Michael G. Brautigam
Cincinnati
To the Editor:
Reading Kimberly Probolus's letter caused me to think seriously about why I have never submitted a letter to The New York Times. Growing up, I found the paper on my breakfast table every morning, often already picked apart by my parents. We discussed Op-Ed writers as if they were family friends; if my mom started talking about Gail or Paul, I knew to pick up the paper if I wanted to join the conversation.
When I left for college, I never questioned spending money on a Times subscription, even while comparing pasta brands at the store to save a few extra cents. Why, then, have I never submitted a letter? When I thought of writing this, my immediate internal response was: I'm not qualified. Why would anyone want to read what I have to say?
I'm not sure I can articulate answers to either of these questions. But to Ms. Probolus: I'm excited to read the opinions of some "nasty, scribbling women" tomorrow, and the next day and hopefully next year as well. And since those who seek change in a system must be participants, I will send this off into the void.

Texto completo: Jason Mileo, 20, of Pasadena was the first.
Killed after being mistaken for an enemy soldier near Baghdad on April 14, 2003, he was the first service member from Anne Arundel County killed in our Mideast wars.
Shannon Kent is a first, too. We can only hope she will be the last.
A Navy cryptologic technician stationed at Fort George G. Meade, Kent was one of the Americans who lost their lives Jan. 16 in a blast set off by a suicide bomber in northern Syria.
She is the first female Navy service member killed in the battle against ISIS since the U.S.-led coalition started fighting the group in 2014. She may be the first woman who called Anne Arundel home to die in a war zone.
The 35-year-old sailor, a native of Pine Plains, New York, had only recently been living in Crownsville with her husband, a retired special forces operator.
In an interview Friday with New York Times columnist Richard A. Opel Jr., Joe Kent said his wife spoke a half-dozen Arabic dialects and four other languages.
"She was one of the first women to complete the rigorous course required for other troops to accompany Navy SEALs on raids. She could run a 3:30 marathon, do a dozen full-arm-hang pull-ups and march for miles with a 50-pound rucksack," Opel wrote.
"She did this while raising two boys, now ages 3 and 18 months, and, for a time, battling cancer."
Nearly 2,000 people gathered at the Naval Academy Chapel on Friday at a memorial service for this remarkable woman living in our midst.
"Senior Chief Kent was an extraordinary wife, mother, daughter, sister, daughter-in-law, friend and valued leader in the Information Warfare Community," said Cmdr. Joseph Harrison, commanding officer of Kent's unit. "Her strength, courage, confidence and resiliency were infectious and exactly what you want in a chief petty officer."
During the memorial service, Kent was posthumously promoted to senior chief petty officer, awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal and a Combat Action Ribbon.
The Navy also recognized her sacrifice by changing the policy that led to her fifth deployment to a combat zone.
Kent was supposed to be getting her doctorate in clinical psychology, but the Navy reversed their decision to send her to the program last fall because of her history with cancer.
After her family and members of Congress called on the Navy to change its policy, a new medical examination and waiver system for officer commissioning programs will take effect this month.
Anne Arundel County now must move quickly to honor Kent as well.
A tree planted in the small memorial grove at Fort Smallwood Park is a little thing. Having Shannon Kent's name added to a plaque in Annapolis won't provide solace to her family.
But there are now 17 names to remember as the local cost of foreign wars that seem so endless.
Thank you, Chief Kent, for your sacrifice.

Texto completo: "Great nations do not fight endless wars," President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, "I do not support the idea of endless war."
Just a few days before Trump's address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump's defenders say: That's just the foreign policy establishment advocating "forever war." When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?
These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.
In traditional wars, defining victory is easy. Victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called "a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam." There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the USS Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.
America's enemies have a very clear definition of victory. For them, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. We know this because they have told us so. The 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator "Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting." That is how the terrorists see Obama's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump's planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.
It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. We don't get to decide unilaterally that the war is over. The enemy gets a vote. Just because we have tired of fighting doesn't mean that they have.
Here is the hard truth: We don't get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought over there, in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought over here - on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It's up to us.
Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters." But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, as much as $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.
In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates there are about 20 terrorist groups - including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K - who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, the New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, "says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years."
Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists' necks. They are focused on survival, not on launching faraway attacks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, dust themselves off, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.
In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. "They did not know if they would survive the hour," he said. "They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail."
The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Texto completo: How do you know if a stock is a good deal? Or the stock market?
The industry bombards us with complicated analysis and unreadable, unnecessarily intimidating jargon. How can you simplify it to what matters?
The easiest way to fathom a stock’s (or the market’s) value is to think like you’re buying the whole business. What’s the price, and what will you get back in the long run?
The price part is easy. Stock prices and broad indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 are quoted widely.
For the “get back” part, many use a figure called the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E. It’s a stock or index price divided by its earnings per share. Some use the past 12 months’ earnings. Others use estimates for the next year (which I prefer, called forward P/Es). If a P/E is 12, you’re paying $12 for every dollar of earnings. Most pundits presume stocks are expensive when P/Es are high and cheap when they’re low. They think high P/E implies low return potential (and vice versa). But there is a better two-step way.
First, flip it by dividing earnings by price. Or, just look up the stock’s P/E ratio at Google Finance and invert it (divide 1 by the P/E). Currently, the S&P 500’s forward P/E is 16. So divide 1 by 16, and you get 0. 0625 or 6. 25 percent. This is the S&P 500’s “earnings yield. ” It’s what you would get each year after tax, forever, if the S&P 500 were a company, you owned it all – 100 percent – and earnings never grew.
Second, to sense value, compare them to long-term bond interest rates. Ten-year U. S. Treasurys currently pay 2. 73 percent. Stocks’ earnings yield is much higher, so a better long-term deal. BBB-rated corporate bonds – investment grade for the average public company, not too risky – yield 4. 45 percent. That’s pretax, so in an average family with a 26 percent tax rate (state and federal) that’s 3. 3 percent after you take out taxes.
Stocks’ 6. 25 percent is almost twice as high. So owning the S&P 500 earns a better return than lending to these same companies.
As mentioned earlier, the earnings yield is your forever, after-tax return from all stocks if earnings never grow. But they do grow! Businesses adapt in the long term, capturing technological change and innovation. New inventions bring new sources of corporate earnings. Think about how many products use a simple microchip. Firm’s routinely dream up new ways to collide evolving technology with basic products and services. Medical progress is unending. It’s all future potential profit.
When you own stocks, you own that future. When you lend by owning bonds, you don’t. You get fixed interest payments. If you need long-term growth to fund your long-term retirement, stocks are the surest way to get it. Earnings yields tell you this future is a bargain today.
Of course, that says nothing about stock prices a month, six months or a year from now. Could be higher or lower. Those wiggles are the short-term and all about society’s varying sentiment toward owing volatile assets. This framework is just how to measure value in the long term and a great way to think about value. For more – and to learn more about different market segments – try some classic investment books. Andrew Tobias’ "The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need" is quite handy. So is "The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money & Investing. "

Texto completo: The gig: Media industry veteran Herb Scannell, 62, was recently named president and chief executive of Southern California Public Radio, the nonprofit that operates KPCC-FM (89.3) in Pasadena. It also runs KUOR-FM in the Inland Empire, KVLA-FM in Coachella Valley and the LAist website. Previously, he led Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon and BBC Worldwide North America. Most recently, he ran Los Angeles digital media company Mitu. He starts Feb. 28.
Rice and beans household: Scannell grew up in the suburbs on New York's Long Island, the youngest of four. His Boston-bred Irish father and his Puerto Rican mother were both social workers. Her rich culture dominated the household, he said, with rice and beans usually winning out over mashed potatoes, which came from a box.
"It was a very different experience than everybody else on our block," Scannell said. Every third summer, he and his siblings stayed with extended family in Puerto Rico. As he grew older, Scannell said, he learned to appreciate growing up in a culture different from his peers. "That was a gift," he said.

'Pop-culture kid': Scannell said he grew up saturated with media, including television and radio. "I'm a pop-culture kid," he said. "I did my homework, but I did it while watching TV."
Scannell's radio experience began early. As a kid, he would spend Tuesday nights listening to a pop music radio station count down the top 20 songs of the week. For fun, Scannell would write them each down on a loose-leaf sheet of paper. Scannell attended Boston College, where he worked at the campus radio station, later becoming the general manager.
Counting posters: After he graduated with degrees in history and English, Scannell wasn't sure what to pursue. He got in touch with a family friend who worked at a country radio station in New York. Scannell was hired as a promotions assistant, and riding around on the subways became part of his routine because he had to count posters of Dolly Parton to make sure the station was getting the ads and space it paid for.
When he was 23, the woman who hired him quit, so Scannell was left on his own. He leaned on his friend, who left radio to work in television, for help. Scannell decided to leave the radio station for a marketing position at Showtime and later became a programmer.
Nickelodeon's golden age: As head of program development at Nickelodeon, Scannell helped shape a generation of children's television. "Nickelodeon's philosophy was, 'We like kids just the way they are,' " he said, no matter their race, size or gender. "Whatever it might be, it was very inclusive to kids."
He helped launch shows including "Dora the Explorer," "Rugrats" and "Hey Arnold!" He was named network president in 1996, and for 10 consecutive years, Nickelodeon was the top-ranked children's cable network, he said. The company challenged notions that boys wouldn't watch shows with female lead characters, he said. And instead of waiting for talent agencies to reach out to them, they traveled the country in search of regular kids.
"We opened up the aperture for kids TV," he said. "We wanted to do what hadn't been done for kids."
A 'whoa' moment: With the success of "Dora the Explorer," the company sold out 23 days of a live show at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Scannell watched as the crowd of children shouted "salta!" (Spanish for "jump") during the show.
It was amazing to see children of all backgrounds chant in unison and bond over a culture rarely seen in media, he said. "It's like a 'whoa' moment because you got 4,000 kids speaking Spanish because they're connecting with a character, and it's not about anything other than their joy," he said.
Switching gears: Sensing that the internet was going to change the way cable networks operated, Scannell left the company to join in the change. He became CEO of Next New Network, an online media company that helped video creators on YouTube distribute their work. He had an idea of turning it into the Viacom of internet television, but he and his team were early, and it was later sold to YouTube.
In a 1999 New York Times profile of Scannell, a colleague referred to him as "competitive." Asked about that description, he responded that Nickelodeon stayed on top for 10 years because he constantly challenged the company to do more to keep other networks at bay, and if that's being competitive, "I'm guilty as charged."
"I want to do what's not being done," he said. "If I'm doing something that everybody else is doing, then I better do it differently."
Celebrating Latinos: In 2017, after heading up BBC Worldwide North America, he was named CEO of Mitu, a digital media start-up targeting a Latino millennial audience. "I always harbored this idea that there was an opportunity to really elevate and celebrate Latino talents and audience," he said.
But last summer, when the company didn't raise enough money and Scannell realized he wouldn't be able to achieve bigger plans he had for it, he resigned. "I was gonna go big or go home," he said.
California living: At KPCC, Scannell said, he plans to emphasize local journalism, covering neighborhoods that may be underserved as other media outlets face financial strains. He also plans to grow the public radio station through podcasts, something that WNYC -- where he served as board chairman -- managed to do successfully, producing shows such as "2 Dope Queens" and "Freakonomics."
California, he said, is a state that many people look to see what's possible. "What happens here matters everywhere," he said.

Fees? Online referrals? Here are some tips to find the right lawyer

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: "Jayme is doing pretty good. We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends."
Jennifer Smith
Legal guardian for Jayme Closs
An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint. Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."
"Jayme is doing pretty good. We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends."

Texto completo: ATLANTA -- There's a lot that is not for sale at For Keeps, a little bookstore with brick walls on Auburn Avenue, which for decades had been the center of commerce, culture and spirit for this city people call Black Mecca.
That copy of Jet magazine from 1964, the one with Alan Alda and Diana Sands on the cover, illustrating an article about interracial romances in the theater? Not for sale. The book of Swahili names for your baby, or that copy of The African Communist? Nope.
But you are welcome to spend all day here reading, if you like. That's the point.
"The reason I'm not selling them is because I want people to have as many interactions with them as they can," said Rosa Duffy, 28, a visual artist with deep Atlanta roots who opened the bookstore in November.
There is plenty to buy, of course. Her shelves hold used black-lit classics from authors like Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Ralph Ellison. If they're well worn, that's all the better.
"I think it tells a story," she said. "Someone actually went through it and read every word and received something from it and you're next. It's like they are almost doing you a favor."
Duffy has always wanted to find a way to work around books. Much of her art includes snippets of text or images from books and journals. It's a style she developed when she was a teenager and would sneak into her father's library to find images among his vast collection of books and rare journals like Soulbook, a periodical from the late 1960s and 70s which its Berkeley, Calif., founders called the revolutionary journal of the black world.
Her father, Eugene Duffy, has worked for three mayors including Atlanta's first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, and Andrew Young, a close confidant of Martin Luther King Jr. who went on to become the United States ambassador to the United Nations and remains a close family friend.
Her dad's collection, along with her sister's, was inspiration for the bookstore. "My grandma has a great collection, too," she said.
After high school, Duffy headed to New York to study at the New School, collecting books along the way. She found some real treasures for cheap, like a hard cover of Pat Parker's "Jonestown and Other Madness" that she dug out of the Strand bookstore's dollar bin.
She also spent time wandering through little shops in the East Village, where books on black history were often limited to one small shelf.
"I always thought that if I ever had the chance I wanted to expand that little shelf somehow," she said.
The chance came after she moved back to Atlanta in 2016 and found herself in a lull between projects. Rent on Auburn Avenue was affordable. Interest in black identity was on the rise. And she had the time and means to make it work.
"It was like all these things were coming together," she said.
The space used to be a shoe store. In the center of the room, she set up a large round table covered with books, political journals and old magazines available for reading only. Many books for sale are displayed on the walls so that the covers are visible, as if they were works of art. Her own prints hang next to them. Music from Charles Mingus or Atlanta native Waka Flocka Flame is often playing in the background.
The location holds a lot of meaning. It's not far from the church she grew up going to or from Spelman and Morehouse, two historically black colleges where her parents went to school. It's a neighborhood on the verge of gentrification and she is determined to help it keep a strong black identity.
"I wanted this space to represent blackness and its vastness but I wanted it to be as inviting as any other bookstore," she said. "It's just that our niche is black folks and our revolution and our movements and all the things that we've done over time that haven't been recognized or been altered so that you don't know the whole truth about them."
The store drew a big crowd when it opened, in part because her sister, the lawyer and journalist Josie Duffy Rice, sent out a tweet about it that the filmmaker Ava DuVernay then retweeted.
Duffy said she is constantly learning more about what to buy and what the community wants, often sifting through collections of books and other materials people bring in when a family member dies.
"Black folks in Atlanta are so aware of their blackness and their history, it's etched in their fabric, as my grandma would say," she said. "I think that's why the store has been successful here. People love themselves as black people and they only want to know more. Atlanta encourages you to be as black as you can be."

Peter Thiel didn’t get the sympathy Jeff Bezos is receiving, and Trump is the reason

Texto completo: When Peter Thiel worked aggressively behind the scenes to put Gawker.com out of business by way of a lawsuit over privacy invasion, there was a lot of talk about the dangers of a billionaire using his limitless resources to suppress a news organization. Democracy dies in darkness, after all, even if it's as horrible as Gawker.

But I’m not hearing that same concern about Amazon CEO and Washington Post publisher Jeff Bezos in his threatening investigations into the National Enquirer.

Washington Post editorial writer Molly Roberts wrote in January 2018, “No one should want Gawker gone — at least, not this way. Thiel’s secret financing of multiple suits against Gawker was legal. But that shouldn’t erase the squeamishness brought on by a billionaire leveraging his wealth to obliterate a media outlet, all as part of a personal vendetta.”

Some liberals are saying the exact opposite now from what they said just a little more than a year ago.

“I never expected to see Jeff Bezos emerge as a hero of democracy,” New York Times liberal Paul Krugman wrote Friday on Twitter. “But he has. A profile in moral courage.”

Here’s the lead sentence of a Krugman column from April 2018: “Peter Thiel, Facebook investor and Donald Trump supporter, is by all accounts a terrible person.”

What Bezos is doing now to the Enquirer essentially mirrors what Thiel did to Gawker: Seek out punishment for a news operation for publishing embarrassing details about his personal life.

Bezos, right now, has investigators looking into the Enquirer for information on how and why they obtained and published information about his extramarital affair. The report came with explicit photos he had sent privately to his mistress, which I’m inclined to guess are the least searched nude selfies in the history of Google.

The intent of the investigation is to intimidate the Enquirer, or other news outlets who might do something similar. Is there question that it would climax in a lawsuit against the Enquirer?

In 2007, one of Gawker’s sister publications ran a story outing Thiel, an intensely private person, as gay. It was one of countless times that one of Gawker Media’s sites had run a story that delighted in voyeurism and likely wrecked the subject’s personal life.

In 2015, Gawker published a story that outed an executive at Conde Nast. The guy was married and had three children. The apparent source of the story was a male sex worker who had felt slighted by the executive. No one outside of New York and publishing circles had even heard of the executive until Gawker spread his private life all over the Internet.

After severe backlash, Gawker deleted the story.

But it was a legal pursuit against Gawker by Terry Bollea, the former wrestler more widely known as Hulk Hogan, that was eventually funded by Thiel, that ended Gawker for good. In 2012, Gawker published a video that showed Bollea having sex with a woman. Representatives for Bollea requested that Gawker take the video down, but after the website declined, Bollea then sought legal remedies.

He failed multiple times in court, but Thiel, who had been investigating Gawker much like Bezos is now investigating the Enquirer, eventually took up the cause to underwrite further legal action by Bollea. Bollea sued Gawker in court for invasion of privacy and in 2016 was awarded $115 million, plus another $25 million by a Florida jury. It bankrupted the website.

Gawker wasn’t worthless. It did occasionally publish stories of real consequence, though not on the scale of the National Enquirer. The Enquirer, in the late 1980s, published evidence that Gary Hart, a presidential candidate, had been having an affair. The tabloid also ended John Edwards’ 2008 campaign after reporting that he was also having an affair that resulted in a child, all while his wife was dying of cancer.

But the difference between Bezos and Thiel is clear. Thiel was a proud supporter of President Trump. The Enquirer glorified Trump's 2016 campaign for president and made a practice of protecting Trump from negative stories about his own personal life.

Thiel and the Enquirer, then, are fair targets for criticism, and even investigation, intended put a chill over the tabloid’s work. Bezos, on the other hand, is a hero of the republic.

Admittedly, I’m fine if I never hear about another Bezos “dick pic,” but the people who attacked Thiel and are now defending Bezos won’t get away with pretending their position is about principles. It’s about hating Trump.

Texto completo: The 2019 Penguin Random House Book Fair is returning this year, and the Carroll County Public Library is inviting readers to join New York Times bestselling author Jamie Ford at its kick-off at 7 p.m. March 1 at Carroll Community College.
Ford, the author of “Love and Other Consolation Prizes,” “Songs of Willow Frost,” and “Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet” - which won the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature - is the son of a Chinese-American father, grew up in Seattle and now lives in Montana with his wife and children.
“We are delighted to be hosting NYT bestselling author Jamie Ford,” said CCPL Communications Director Lisa Picker this week. “Carroll County is a community of readers. We value literacy and opportunities for lifelong learning.
“When an author comes to Carroll, we sell out,” she said.
Last year, Melanie Benjamin spoke at the event, said Picker, “and despite snow, wind, and wide-spread power outages across the area, the room was packed with literature lovers.”
This is the library’s second year helping with an evening author event for the Penguin Random House Book Fair. Before that, both adult and children’s authors were part of activities Saturday, she explained.
“We came up with the idea to move the adult author to the Friday evening spot,” Picker told the Times . “Attendees now make an evening of it - they’ll go out to dinner beforehand and then come here an author and attend the book signing.
“Folks will be able to purchase additional copies of Ford’s other works, and the proceeds benefit the Carroll Community College Foundation,” she said.
Tickets are $15 and include a copy of the anniversary edition of “Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.” They can be purchased at any CCPL branch or online at library.carr.org/bookfair.
This event is a partnership between Penguin Random House, Carroll Community College, A Likely Story Bookstore, and CCPL. Full details on the book fair can be found online: https://www.carrollcc.edu/bookfair.

Texto completo: Cost rises as quality child care becomes more scarce
Re: "If you think housing's pricey, try child care" (Page A1, Feb. 3):
The high cost of child care is a constant burden for families. Despite the enormous expense, the average child care provider is one of the lowest-paid workers.
An average family child care provider will work 40-60 hours a week. Their hourly rate can easily fall below the "livable" minimum wage set by the state. Parents seeking child care are not looking for just a babysitter. Child care providers are responsible for providing a safe environment and serving as a child's primary educator during the most critical years of their emotional, cognitive and mental development.
The number of child care openings is declining. Unless we find a way to make the early childhood field an attractive profession with livable wages and benefits for individuals who have the patience, skills and compassion to raise our most valuable resource, the cost will continue to rise as quality care becomes scarce.
John Jones, Antioch
Air quality keeps children from playing outside
Re: "For some, California dream has become hazy" (Page B1, Feb. 3):
It is an absolute disgrace that the people of Imperial County are resigned to live indoors and suffer from chronic asthma attacks due to agricultural burning and industrial activity.
Residents should not have to think twice about sending their children out into the yard to play, and yet that is the current status in these hazy areas.
This proves more than ever that fossil fuel pollution is a menace wreaking havoc on our bodies and our societies. Climate pollution is not just endangering future generations, it is hurting people right now.
There is no time to lose. We need to reduce emissions in a just, feasible way that doesn't burden low-income communities. The best way to do so is with a carbon fee and dividend (such as that proposed in HR 763), which returns the collected revenue back to households so they can pay for health care and adjust to their new low-carbon lifestyles.
Jatin Khanna, San Francisco
Warren, Harris shouldn't simmer down' one iota
Re: "Howard Schultz should be recruited to run as a Dem," "Perhaps Schultz can show Democrats the way back," "Wealthy need more say in allocating their tax dollars" (Letters to the editor, Feb 5):
Marc Thiessen recently "mansplained" on the kind of people the Democrats should run for office and the kind of policies we should endorse ("Dems mad at Schultz for more than risking Trump's re-election," Eastbaytimes.com, Feb. 3). He advised Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren to "simmer down a bit," and why taxing wealthy people is wrong.
Sorry, Marc, you are a Republican apologist, and you have no right to opine on the direction the Democratic Party should take.
We don't need oligarchs to determine how much philanthropy they want to give us, we need just taxation to reverse the growing inequity caused by decreasing tax rates over the last 40 years, and a democratic decision-making process on how to spend our national wealth.
I don't expect Marc Thiessen or Howard Schultz or any other billionaire to like it, and I don't want Warren or Harris to simmer down one iota.
Deborah Bayer, Richmond
Clergy just a cross-section of humanity at large
Re: "Pope admits that priests, bishops have sexually abused nuns" (Page A6, Feb. 6):
In light of recent and past public revelations, it is time for the faithful of all religions to realize that their clergy are no better or worse than their followers.
They are simply a cross-section of humanity at large who choose a particular profession for private reasons.
Rohnda Stimson, Santa Clara
HR 763 lowers the price of low-carbon goods
A Jan. 28 letter to the editor ("Carbon act would double cost of climate change") summarizes the views of Nobel laureate economist William Nordhaus on the principle of putting a fee on carbon as contained in HR 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. Professor Nordhaus clarified his views in an Oct. 13, 2018, interview in The New York Times.
In the interview, he said: "When I talk to people about how to design a carbon price, I think the model is British Columbia. You raise electricity prices by $100 a year, but then the government gives back a dividend that lowers internet prices by $100 year. In real terms, you're raising the price of carbon goods but lowering the prices of non-carbon-intensive goods. That's the model of how something like this might work."
HR 763 is akin to the British Columbia approach. Please contact your representative to support the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act.

Texto completo: A 29-year-old man is scheduled to be arraigned in Plymouth District Court on Friday on drug charges after investigators said he ordered Oxycodone on the “dark web," according to a statement released by Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz.
Andrew King of Plymouth was arrested late Thursday following an investigation that began earlier this month by Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Commonwealth Interstate Narcotics Reduction Enforcement Team — South, according to the district attorney's office.
Detectives with the enforcement team were contacted by special agents assigned to Homeland Security Investigations regarding a series of packages that were ordered and sent to 133 Bettencourt Road in Plymouth, where King lives.
A package containing Oxycodone was previously intercepted by Customs and Border Protection from Colombia to the Bettencourt Road address, the statement said.
“Further investigation identified a series of suspicious packages had been sent to that same Plymouth address since August, 2018," the statement said.
The dark web is a part of the Internet where buyers using special browsers can make purchases anonymously. Law enforcement officials have raised concerns that the technology is allowing illegal drugs to be purchased online.
Investigators obtained a search warrant for 133 Bettencourt Road and, on Thursday, law enforcement officials arranged for the intercepted package to be delivered to that address.
“At approximately 3:40 pm, an undercover State Police trooper made delivery of the DHL package to 133 Bettencourt Road. The package was accepted by King, who carried the package into his residence before officers executed their search warrant," the statement said.
A search of the residence also turned up heroin, Suboxone, and Subutex, the statement said.

Texto completo: There were still some balcony tickets available at press time for Arlo Guthrie's show at Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts on Sunday night.
The folk troubadour is on the road celebrating the 50th anniversary of his hit "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" and the movie made of the hit. The "Back by Popular Demand Alice's Restaurant" tour coincides with the 50th anniversary of the 1969 release of the film, "Alice's Restaurant," directed by Arthur Penn who garnered a best director Oscar nomination.
Guthrie, like his father Woody Guthrie became known for protest songs against injustice, wrote the song as a satirical jab against the Vietnam War era draft. The 18- minute story is very loosely based on a real event in Guthrie's early life. The song explains how his arrest for dumping trash keeps him from being drafted because of his criminal record.
"I didn't think I was gonna live long enough to have to learn 'Alice's Restaurant' again," Arlo Guthrie said, joking in a press release. "It was a quirky kinda thing to begin with. Nobody writes an 18-minute monologue expecting fame and fortune. The initial success of the song really took me by surprise more than anyone else."
Last year the Library of Congress selected the song to be included in the National Recording Registry which honors and preserves songs with cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the American soundscape.
Guthrie, will be joined onstage by longtime collaborators from his former band Shenandoah,Terry "A La Berry" Hall on drums, Steve Ide on guitar and vocals and percussionist Carol Ide who also sings.
Arlo's daughter Sarah Lee Guthrie, a lauded singer-songwriter in her own right, will open the show.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. show presented by Rams Head On Stage are $75 to $90 and available via ramsheadonstage.com.
If you miss the boat for Arlo Guthrie all is not lost. Check out Valerie June at the Rams Head On Stage performing Sunday night as well.
June was born and raised in Tennessee and migrated to Memphis to begin performing when she was 19.
She combines blues, gospel and Appalachian folk in a style she calls "organic moonshine roots music" and plays guitar, banjo, lap-steel guitar.
After releasing three self-produced albums and moving to Brooklyn in 2011 she was introduced to Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, who produced and co-wrote several songs on her 2013 breakout album "Pushin' Against a Stone." The record included performance by Booker T. Jones.
The New York Times called June one of the "most intriguing, fully formed new talents" in it's review.
The record and June, marked especially by her unique voice, were well received in the United Kingdom and Europe, and her songs "Workin' Woman Blues" and "You Can't Be Told" were moderate hits.
In 2014 she was nominated for a Blues Music Award as best new artist for "Pushin' Against a Stone."
Now she's out working behind her newest release "The Order of Time." The music varies from soul shouting to blues and African folk and her overall sound reflects the disparate influences in all. Despite the music's varied nature, the songs all belong to a cohesive family - a larger rumination on the passage of time and how it affects us.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $39.50 at ramsheadonstage.com.
On Valentine's Day velvety voiced Sue Matthews and pianist Stef Scaggiari are joined by guitarist Steve Abshire for a special Valentine's evening.
Sue Matthews has a smooth voice and impressive range, both on the musical register and in her songbook, from cabaret to jazz and the classics.
Stefan Scaggiari is an experienced artist with dazzling versatility - at home with Ellington, Gershwin, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, and of course as a jazz improviser.
Abshire played guitar in U.S. Navy bands for 24 years including 18 years with the Commodores, the Navy's jazz ensemble. Since retiring in 1997 he has played all over including sessions with the "Great Guitars" most recently with Bucky Pizzarelli and Frank Vignola.
The show is from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 go to 49westcoffehouse.com for info or call 410-626-9796 for reservations.

Gulf Breeze mayor 'scandal' not worthy of national news

Texto completo: Scandal! If you've read the news lately, you may have come across a story or two about a local politician. The mayor of Gulf Breeze, David Landfair, recently resigned, citing "inappropriate texting with an adult woman." Since we now know all of the details of the "scandal," let me vouch for his character.
I first met retired Lt Col Landfair while he was at the helm of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) at Gulf Breeze High School. During my high school career, I watched him help countless students with their futures: getting military academy appointments worth $400,000, ROTC scholarships, and various other college-related help. He even wrote the book on how to find the money to pay for higher education.
Under his guidance, JROTC cadets have racked up thousands of volunteer hours for the benefit of the community. While serving as the senior aerospace science instructor for GBHS, he simultaneously served on the Gulf Breeze City Council, securing various accomplishments for the city.
Before coming back to his home town, he served 22 years in the United States Air Force as an officer. He has over 500 flying hours through combat missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and has held various command positions, one such as being the commander of the 309th Intelligence Squadron on Kadena Air Base, in Okinawa, Japan. All in all, ever since the start of his adult life, Public Service is all he's known.
The reason he resigned was because of "inappropriate texting." His resignation was voluntary, but I think we all know why he did, because all a person needs in today's society is an accusation – and this small town "scandal" would've become national news. Or has it already? As The New York Times, The Washington Post and even the Associated Press has picked up on this "scandal" – as WKRG of Mobile, AL has titled.
So, in conclusion, I have some things to ask of readers. Does inappropriate texting with an adult woman need to be in national news? Does "inappropriate texting" take away from someone's leadership abilities? Has the Me Too movement gone too far? At least Brett Kavanaugh, associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, wasn't victimized.
Nick Nasse Jr. is a former student of ex-Gulf Breeze Mayor David Landfair.

DEMOCRATS UNVEIL GREEN NEW DEAL LEGISLATORS AIM TO CREATE JOBS, TAKE ON THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., unveiled their Green New Deal resolution Thursday, outlining the massive piece of legislation they hope will tackle a litany of issues related to the United States' role in global climate change.
"Climate change and our environmental challenges are one of the biggest existential threats to our way of life. Not just as a nation, but as a world," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at a news conference outside of the Capitol Building.
"What this resolution is doing is saying this is our first step. Our first step is to define the problem and define the scope of the solution," she added. "And so we're here to say that small, incremental policy solutions are not enough. They can be part of a solution, but they are not the solution unto itself."
Mr. Markey predicted more Democrats would sign on and said some Republicans may back the plan.
"This is now a voting issue across the country," he said. "The green generation has risen up and they are saying they want this issue solved" as one of the top two or three issues in the 2020 election, Mr. Markey said.
The sweeping resolution includes a 10-year commitment to convert "100 percent of the country's power demands" to "clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources"; to upgrade "all existing buildings" to meet energy efficiency requirements; and to expand high-speed rail so broadly that most air travel would be rendered obsolete.
The initiative, introduced as nonbinding resolutions in the House and Senate, is tethered to an infrastructure program that its authors say could create millions of new "green jobs," while guaranteeing health care, "a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security" to every American.
Modeled on President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s, the resolution will not move in its current form, but some ideas could advance as part of more modest legislation to address the climate crisis.
The legislation has become a key policy initiative for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New Yorker who, shortly after being elected in November, joined the Sunrise Movement to protest over the climate change issue in the office of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. She later paired up with Mr. Markey to begin working on the legislation.
In an interview with NPR earlier Thursday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that although their proposed solutions are bold, they're "nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country, to the world."
The resolution says that the deal will "promote justice and equity" to a dozen communities, including indigenous peoples, migrant communities and low-income workers.
"So really the heart of the Green New Deal is about social justice and it's about allowing and fighting for things like fully-funded pensions for coal miners in West Virginia, fighting for clean water in Flint, and fighting for the ability of indigenous peoples to take a leadership role in where we're moving as a country," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.
Speaking at a news conference Thursday, Ms. Pelosi said that while she hasn't yet seen the details of the proposal, "I do know that it's enthusiastic, and we welcome all the enthusiasm that's out there."
Republicans seized on the proposal with relish, portraying the entire resolution as absurd. Bob Salera, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, called the idea "zany." The Republican National Committee derided it as "a socialist wish list."
For all of its audacity, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Markey also steered clear of several thorny issues.
The resolution does not specify a date for eliminating planet-warming emissions, instead calling for the elimination of fossil fuels from major economic sectors "as much as technologically feasible."
It also avoids denouncing specific types of clean energy alternatives, specifically nuclear.
The New York Times and The Associated Press contributed.

Republicans dismiss Harris at their peril; President Trump is the latest to note that Kamala Harris is a crowd-pleaser.

Texto completo: President Trump, who knows a thing or two about big crowds and patriotic backdrops, gave credit where it was due last week to Sen. Kamala Harris for the rollout of her presidential campaign before a crowd of 20,000 outside Oakland City Hall.
Compared to other Democrats, the president told the New York Times, she had "a better crowd -- better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat."
Though the president mangled the pronunciation of Harris' first name, his pronouncement suggested he was the latest politician to see what the California GOP learned a decade ago: Harris is not a campaigner to be taken lightly.

California Republicans learned that lesson during Harris' 2010 race for attorney general. She was the young, anti-death-penalty district attorney from San Francisco, running uphill against an old-school Republican, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley. But it was more than a San Francisco-L.A., Democratic-Republican battle.
Nationally, 2010 was the year of the tea party when Republicans swept Democrats from control of Congress and captured several statehouses. In California, it was also the first year the attorney general's office drew widespread national attention.
Part of the reason was that the Virginia-based Republican State Leadership Committee, then led by Ed Gillespie, former counselor to President George W. Bush, targeted the race. The group spent $31.7 million trying to flip control of state offices to Republican hands that year. Its one California expenditure was a $1-million television ad featuring the mother of a slain San Francisco police officer denouncing Harris for not seeking the death penalty against the officer's killer.
At the time, the committee's spokesman told me that the group hoped a Republican attorney general in California would provide an important "firewall" against the Obama administration. Harris' defeat would have had an added benefit of derailing a rising Democratic star: "If that is a byproduct of defeating her, we're perfectly happy with that," the spokesman said.
Harris had her friends, too, however, most notably Barack Obama. Harris joined the Obama camp early. In 2004, while serving as San Francisco district attorney, she co-hosted a fundraiser for Obama in his Illinois run for the U.S. Senate. The following year, he packed Bimbo's nightclub in San Francisco for a Harris fundraiser.
In 2007, Harris trudged through the Des Moines snow campaigning on presidential candidate Obama's behalf, an act not without political risk. Hillary Clinton was then the front-runner, and California was Clinton turf.
"That was probably not the right political calculation at the time," said Buffy Wicks, who worked as Obama's California organizer in 2007.
It was, however, prescient. And in the end, Obama more than repaid Harris' support.
In October 2010, after Gillespie's ad began airing, Obama turned out for a Harris fundraiser at the Atherton home of former state Controller Steve Westly. As the campaign closed, organized labor aired an ad produced by one of Obama's consultants featuring Harris with Obama, who told viewers he had endorsed her.
Republicans gained six state attorney general seats on election night in 2010, and nearly won a seventh. In California, Harris was having a "Dewey Defeats Truman" moment. Like that infamous 1948 headline proclaiming incorrectly that Harry Truman had lost the presidency to Thomas Dewey, a headline on the San Francisco Chronicle's website declared: "Cooley beats Harris to win attorney general race."
Two weeks later, however, when all 9.6 million votes were counted, that turned out not to be true. Harris had won by 0.7%. The Republican wave of 2010 stopped at the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
A framed copy of the Cooley-defeats-Harris headline survives on her campaign consultant's office wall in downtown San Francisco. That consultant? Ace Smith. Smith ran Clinton's 2008 campaign in California, then joined Harris' team, running her races for attorney general in 2010 and 2014, U.S. Senate in 2016, and, now, for the highest office in the land.
Harris' candidacy is certainly a long shot for 2020. But as Trump seemed to acknowledge last week, she is not a campaigner who can simply be ignored.

Texto completo: Sergeant on leave from capitol force amid probe of social media posts
A sergeant with Virginia Capitol Police has been placed on leave after an anti-fascist group said his social media posts referenced symbols used by white-supremacist groups.
Sgt. Robert A. Stamm, 36, was placed on paid administrative leave Wednesday, according to Joe Macenka, a Capitol Police spokesman. Macenka said an internal investigation was started this week after officials were made aware of social media postings, but he declined to provide details, saying it was a personnel matter.
The suspension of Stamm adds another note of chaos to the uproar engulfing Richmond, where people have gathered around the State Capitol to protest Gov. Ralph Northam (D) after the revelation of a racist photo on his medical-school yearbook page. Stamm was assigned to police those gatherings and was apparently spotted by the anti-fascist group using a bandage to cover a large neck tattoo.
The site Antifascists of the Seven Hills, which describes itself as working to "fight fascists," published a blog post about Stamm that included photographs it said depicted the officer. The post said several of the images were pulled from Stamm's social media accounts. Police said the man in the photos is Stamm.
Stamm is in his police uniform in one, and others show him lifting weights. In some photos Stamm is shown with several tattoos, flags and other symbols that the group said are connected with white supremacists and Nazis.
One of Stamm's tattoos, the site asserts, is a "Wolfsangel" symbol, an image that has been associated with Nazi Germany.
Macenka confirmed that Stamm had been assigned to monitor the protesters outside the governor's mansion Saturday and Monday. He said the Capitol Police have a policy requiring officers to cover visible tattoos with clothing such as long-sleeved shirts or turtleneck shirts.
Macenka said Stamm usually wore a large bandage to cover up a "rather prominent tattoo on the left side of his neck."
Stamm is "not alone" in wearing something to cover up tattoos, Macenka said. "I honestly don't know what the tattoo is of," he said of Stamm's tattoo. "I have only ever seen the patch."
Jeremy A. Best, an assistant professor of history at Iowa State University who has looked at the rise of white nationalism in the United States, said Thursday that a tattoo shown on Stamm's neck from the Seven Hills site looked "closely" like a Wolfsangel.
The Seven Hills site also posted a photo of Stamm that they said he had overlaid with a symbol associated with the Asatru Folk Assembly. Authorities have said some of the followers of Asatru, a neo-pagan group, are white supremacists.
"Sometimes this stuff can be adhered to in a sort of ignorant kind of way where you subscribe to a generically white identity," Best said. He said some people may think of it as similar to being part of black-pride or Latino-pride movements.
But Best said "someone who has this much of it is someone who should be questioned about the constellation of ideas he has in these images."
Attempts to reach Stamm or his family members were unsuccessful. Stamm's social media accounts had been taken down by Thursday. Stamm changed his name from Robert A. Goward in 2017, Virginia court records show.
The New York Times and the Richmond Times-Dispatch were among media outlets to first report on Stamm's administrative leave.
Stamm has been with the department since 2004 and was promoted last year to sergeant, according to officials. The Virginia Division of Capitol Police oversees security for elected officials, state employees and other state agencies at the State Capitol.
Carl Raschke, a religion professor at the University of Denver who has looked at white-supremacist groups, said that competing groups often claim that different symbols signify different beliefs. He said some analysis is "fast and loose" in giving labels to what they may mean.
He said some symbols that can be found in "regional identity movements all over Germany and Europe" are a "reaction to neo-liberalism" and can be "painted by the politics of certain groups."
"It's hard to draw conclusions just based on symbolism," Raschke said.
In 2015, two men in the Richmond area were charged with gun conspiracy counts related to targeting synagogues and black churches. In that case, the FBI alleged the men were part of a "white supremacy extremist version of the Asatru faith."

Hill titan, longest-serving member of Congress and auto industry champion

Texto completo: John D. Dingell Jr., a Michigan Democrat who, as the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, used his considerable power in the House of Representatives to uncover government fraud and defend the interests of his home state's automobile industry, died Feb. 7 at his home in Dearborn. He was 92.
The office of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced the death. Mr. Dingell had complications from prostate cancer.
Mr. Dingell announced in February 2014 that he would not seek a 30th full term in Congress, and he was succeeded by his wife, Debbie Dingell. That November, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.
Mr. Dingell had served as the representative from Michigan's 15th Congressional District since 1955, when he won a special election to replace his father, John D. Dingell Sr., a New Deal Democrat who died of tuberculosis while in office.
Known as "Big John" and "The Truck" for his forceful nature and his hulking 6-foot-3-inch frame, the younger Dingell rose to become chairman in 1981 of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handled nearly half of the bills in the House and covered a sprawling policy realm including transportation, consumer affairs and public health.
When asked to define the jurisdiction of his committee, Mr. Dingell liked to point at a photograph of the Earth taken from space.
He was one of the American auto industry's most stalwart, influential friends on Capitol Hill, and invariably resisted efforts to regulate car manufacturers. In addition to repeatedly blocking more stringent fuel-efficiency and emissions standards, he staved off efforts to require safety features such as seat belts and air bags.
Mr. Dingell's unwavering allegiance to the auto industry drew criticism, especially after his 1981 marriage to Deborah Insley, a senior executive at General Motors and a member of that company's founding family. One environmental lobbyist, a longtime foe of Mr. Dingell's, said the congressman was "literally married to General Motors," a charge Mr. Dingell denied.
"I was fighting for autoworkers long before I met Deborah," he told The Washington Post in 2010. "The fact is that I am not married to the auto industry, but I am elected to represent the people of Michigan and in our part of the country. My people live and die by the success of the auto industry and manufacturing."
In 1979, he sponsored a bill to prohibit federal spending on passive restraints such as air bags and accused the Transportation Department of concealing evidence that air bags were at risk of exploding and burning passengers. Five years later, he continued to attack the air bag as a "defective instrument" that "does not work except in head-on collisions and only in a fraction of those."
"Because of his influence among the Democrats in the House, it was impossible to get a consistent Democratic Party stand over the decades for stronger regulation of the industry," consumer-safety advocate Ralph Nader said. "So the existing standards became obsolete, and that was fine with him."
As forceful as he was about defending Detroit, Mr. Dingell was equally known for his aggressive efforts to root out government and corporate fraud as the chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. He was "an investigative powerhouse," according to the New York Times. "Everything from nuts and bolts to blood banks, bottled water and cardiac pacemakers are unquestionably safer now because of Mr. Dingell's efforts."
His inquiries brought down more than one government official, including lobbyist and former Ronald Reagan adviser Michael K. Deaver, who was convicted of perjury in 1987 after lying under oath during Mr. Dingell's investigation of illegal influence-peddling.
Deaver received a three-year suspended sentence and a $100,000 fine, a punishment Mr. Dingell considered too lenient. "An ordinary citizen who steals a Social Security check, goes for a joyride or is caught with a few grams of marijuana goes to jail, but someone of wealth and influence who lies to a grand jury and Congress has little to fear," he said at the time. "The message is: The powerful can get away with things most people can't."
Mr. Dingell's work on the subcommittee in the 1980s and early '90s also discovered overbilling by hospitals and corruption within the generic-drug industry.
An inquiry during the Reagan years into the withholding of millions of federal dollars meant to clean up a toxic waste site resulted in the resignation of an Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Stanford University President Donald Kennedy resigned after revelations before Mr. Dingell's panel that the school used federal money to pay for "research expenses," including an antique commode, a 72-foot yacht and floral arrangements.
Mr. Dingell's years-long investigation of scientific fraud at the National Institutes of Health led to the rare retraction of a research paper by Nobel laureate David Baltimore but ultimately found no wrongdoing and drew criticism of Mr. Dingell as an overzealous witch-hunter.
"We do not wear lace on our drawers as we conduct our investigations," Mr. Dingell told the New York Times in 1991. "I'm not paid to be a nice guy. I'm paid to look after the public interest."
His continued allegiance to the auto industry, however, cost him his job as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
In late 2008, outspoken environmental advocate Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) challenged Mr. Dingell for the position, calling the Michigan congressman "a determined opponent on clean air, climate change and energy issues."
Waxman won the narrow race with the help of votes from newly elected Democrats who had been swept into office on the coattails of Obama's promise of radical change.
Just weeks after he lost his chairmanship, Mr. Dingell played a key role in securing a multibillion-dollar bailout package to aid GM and Chrysler, which were in danger of collapse as the nation descended into recession. He continued to lobby for further aid through the 2009 federal stimulus package and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was primarily aimed at saving the country's large banks but ended up funneling billions of dollars to the two automakers.
"Do you know what would have happened to my constituents if those companies had gone under?" Mr. Dingell told The Post in 2010. "I went through the Depression as a boy. My mother had to put paper into her shoes and walk around in the snow. . . . We had people starving to death. Do you think I'm silly enough to let that happen again?"
Raised in Washington
John David Dingell Jr. was born on July 8, 1926, in Colorado Springs into a family of Polish descent. He moved to Detroit as a boy and then to Washington when his father was elected to the House in 1932. He was a congressional page throughout his teenage years, and graduated from Georgetown Preparatory School in 1944.
After serving in the Army in World War II, he earned a bachelor's degree in 1949 and a law degree in 1952 from Georgetown University. He spent summers during school working as a park ranger in the Rocky Mountains and at Mount Rainier in Washington state, indulging in a love of the outdoors and hunting.
He clerked for a federal circuit court judge for a year after college and in 1954 landed a position in Michigan as the Wayne County prosecutor. He held that job only briefly before his father's death.
When Mr. Dingell was sworn into office in 1955, he pledged to continue working on issues that were important to his father.
He introduced legislation that created a Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department and became an indefatigable proponent of health-care reform, annually sponsoring the national health-care legislation that his father introduced in 1943. He presided over the House when Medicare was passed in 1965, and lent the gavel he had used that day to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who used it when the House passed the 2010 health-care overhaul.
Mr. Dingell's first marriage, to Helen Henebry, ended in divorce. Their daughter, Jeanne Dingell, died in 2015. In addition to his wife Debbie, survivors include three children from his first marriage, John D. Dingell III, Christopher Dingell and Jennifer Dingell; a brother; a sister; and three grandchildren.
In retirement, Mr. Dingell became a social-media star as he took to Twitter with self-deprecating jokes and of-the-moment commentary. "Staff has now informed me of what a Kardashian is," he tweeted in 2014, referring to the family famous for its tabloid appearances and reality TV shows. "I'm only left with more questions."
Mr. Dingell was widely regarded as one of the more inscrutable members of Congress. He was a hunter and a onetime board member of the National Rifle Association, as well as a fan of Kennedy Center ballet performances. He was a former park ranger who co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but became one of conservationists' prime enemies for his fierce opposition to tightening fuel-efficiency standards.
"The ambiguity of our system is in a way summed up in Dingell, who handles it with great aplomb," Rep. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) said in a 1983 interview with The Post. "He is now the best legislator in the House. The reason for that is his remarkable capacity to live with ambiguity, which you have to do up here. . . . The world isn't simple, there are so many competing interests, each with a bit of the truth. If you try to stake everything out in terms of black and white, it will kill you."

A mail-order DNA test unravels a lifetime mystery for ‘Inheritance’ author Dani Shapiro

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Texto completo: Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, who is touring the media circuit now in promotion of her new book, Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts, has problems that extend far beyond her terrible interviewing techniques.

She has been accused of plagiarizing huge portions of her book, which, ironically enough, is about ethical journalism.

Vice News’ Michael Moynihan, whose newsroom appears in a none-too-flattering light in Abramson's book, was the first to accuse the former Times editor outright of theft.

“ All three chapters on Vice were clotted with mistakes. Lots of them. The truth promised in Merchants of Truth was often not true," he tweeted. "While trying to corroborate certain claims, I noticed that it also contained ... plagiarized passages."

Moynihan provided hard examples to back his allegation, including side-by-side comparisons of Abramson’s book and the works from which she most certainly appears to have plagiarized. For example: Tweet
Moynihan warned that he had only looked a the passages directly pertaining to Vice. Journalist Ian Frisch also claims to have found examples of plagiarism in Merchants of Truth , saying he knows the passages in Abramson’s book are not original because he wrote them:TweetIt's worth noting that the above examples were uncovered after only a cursory review of the Abramson book. There may be much more where this comes from, and it may get much worse for the author.

Abramson, for her part, defended herself from the allegations Wednesday, claiming in a Fox News interview that she “certainly didn’t plagiarize" and that she doesn’t “think it's an issue at all.” She also boasted that Merchants of Truth has roughly 70 pages of footnotes. However, the problem with this final claim is that there is not a single thing in those more than 70 pages of footnotes to explain the similarities between what's in her book and the examples highlighted by Moynihan.

It's entirely possible that this entire episode is about an assistant who failed to notify an author about the source of the material provided for her book. It's entirely possible that Abramson never meant to include the works of other authors without attribution, and that this is all the result of miscommunication between her and the people who helped her write her book. But Abramson is not making any of those defenses. She is not even acknowledging that portions of her book read note-for-note like materials written long before she even landed a book deal. Rather, Abramson's response so far has been to claim that the allegations are sour grapes from a newsroom that is unhappy with the way it is portrayed in her book.

“Many people from Vice have been taking issue with the book it seems,” she said on Fox News. “I think they don't like the portrayal of Vice.”

She added later, in a series of Tweets, that, “The attacks on my book from some [Vice News] reflect their unhappiness with what I consider a balanced portrayal.”

Abramson also said on social media, “I endeavored to accurately and properly give attribution to the hundreds of sources that were part of my research. I take seriously the issues raised and will review the passages in question.”

We eagerly await the findings of her review.

Amazon's Bezos accuses National Enquirer parent of 'blackmail' attempt

Texto completo: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is firing back at National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. (AMI) over what he is calling an "extortion and blackmail" attempt by the tabloid.
In a lengthy post on Medium on Thursday, Bezos details alleged correspondence between the lawyer for his lead investigator, Martin Singer, and Dylan Howard, the chief content officer for AMI.
In the emails posted by Bezos, Howard says the Enquirer would post a series of images it has of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, the Amazon founder's love interest, if Bezos did not release a statement "affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. " The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they will stop "referring to such a possibility. "
The images, according to Howard's email posted by Bezos, include a variety of private pictures Bezos and Sanchez, such as a "below the belt selfie" of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez "smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene. "

Bezos shared the Medium post from his official Twitter account. Amazon has separately confirmed the authenticity of the post, but declined to comment further. Howard did not immediately respond to a USA TODAY request for comment.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent one another. The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to put Gavin de Becker from his security team onto the case of investigating how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.
Bezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over an investigation the Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer," Bezos writes. "They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. "
Bezos also notes in his blog how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called 'Catch and Kill' process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times story about how Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "

The Pecker-Trump relationship
Pecker has been a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump, of course, has been a longtime critic of Bezos, Amazon and the Washington Post, frequently targeting all three on Twitter.
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused the company of participating in a scheme to help him win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about alleged extramarital affairs before the election. More than a year before the election, Pecker met with Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and an unnamed member of his campaign to discuss ways the company could help bottle up damaging stories about Trump.
In August 2016, AMI struck a deal with former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal to pay her $150,000 for the rights to publish her claim to have carried on an affair with Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors said the company’s “principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to suppress (her) story so as to prevent it from influencing the election. ”
Cohen pleaded guilty last year to orchestrating that payment and another, to the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, both of which violated federal campaign finance laws. Soon after, prosecutors promised not to bring charges against AMI in exchange for its cooperation with their investigation, one of two criminal probes now encircling the president. U. S. District Judge William Pauley said in a decision on Thursday that the probe of the campaign finance violations is ongoing.

Real estate tycoon's investment trust sues his son — and he responds in kind

Texto completo: Happy families are all alike; unhappy families sue one another from California to New York.
So might Tolstoy begin the saga of the family of Joel S. Marcus, the real estate tycoon credited with helping to turn Cambridge into one of the world's biggest biotech hubs.
Marcus, 71, cofounded Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a publicly traded real estate investment trust that builds commercial properties and leases them to life science companies. It owns and manages more than 22 million square feet of lab and office space across the country, including 4.8 million in Cambridge.
He's also embroiled in a spectacular legal battle with his 40-year-old son. The eldest of three children, Steven Marcus lives in London and has started a rival British real estate company that also plans to house life science firms.
Alexandria Real Estate sued Steven Marcus and his startup, RUNLABS, in December for alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition. The suit says he misused Alexandria's name and logo, an image of the Alexandria lighthouse in ancient Egypt, in fund-raising pitches to venture capitalists.
Steven Marcus also falsely claimed the startup evolved from Alexandria, according to the suit.
“Steven Marcus has never been an employee or had any formal business relationship with Alexandria, nor has he had any other interest in Alexandria aside from his familial relationship with Joel Marcus," says the complaint filed in US District Court in San Francisco. Joel Marcus lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., not far from his Pasadena-based company.
The younger Marcus is firing back with legal salvos of his own. He has asked the US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to take Alexandria's registered trademarks off the books. He says he came up with the Alexandria name and logo as an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and that they belong to him.
On Thursday, he sued his father and Alexandria in New York state court. The suit alleges Alexandria owes him more than $12 million for devising a new financing strategy for the company in 2013, work he says his father took credit for.
“I didn't believe that you sue your family, but when he sued me, we decided to pursue this vigorously," Steven Marcus said in an interview. He contends his father is waging a personal crusade against him and wants to torpedo an up-and-coming rival. Of the family feud, he says, “I recognize it has a Shakespearean touch."
In another twist, a cousin of Steven Marcus's appears to be siding with Joel Marcus.
The ugly disagreement came up during a conference call Tuesday when Joel Marcus, executive chairman of Alexandria, spoke with investment analysts about the firm's fourth-quarter performance.
“Can you comment a little bit about what's happening with your eldest son?" an analyst asked.
Joel Marcus replied, “If you look at anyone who is trying to bring any discredit or any cloud to the company, I think you can assume that that is a meaningless approach."
Without naming his son, he said, “The kinds of things that are going on are clearly illegal and they're immoral and they will be dealt with in a very severe fashion."
Joel Marcus declined to discuss the controversy with the Globe. But lawyers for Alexandria said Thursday that the company is doing what any firm would do if someone infringed on its trademarks.
“This was a business dispute, pure and simple," said Patrick Gunn, a San Francisco lawyer.
Trademark disagreements are common in the corporate world. But this dispute is unusual because it's so personal, exposing a bitter rift in the family of Joel Marcus, a prominent developer who helped found Alexandria and has run the company since 1997.
With a market value of about $14 billion, Alexandria has played a key role in the sprouting of biotech clusters from San Diego to New York to Cambridge. The company first started leasing properties to biotechs in California in the 1990s. Joel Marcus, a lawyer, had been representing firms that wanted laboratory space near major academic institutions.
In the early 2000s, Alexandria turned its focus to Cambridge, especially the then-gritty neighborhood of Kendall Square near MIT. Today, after spending millions to construct gleaming buildings for biotech startups and Big Pharma firms, Alexandria says it's the biggest owner of lab space in Cambridge.
Steven Marcus said he grew up in Southern California and earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia University in New York in 2004. He was never close to his father, he said in an interview.
“We didn't have an adversarial relationship, but it's hard for me to recall having a good relationship either," he said.
Nonetheless, he says he played a pivotal role in his father's business.
In 1997, the company was called Health Science Properties, a name his father wanted to dump, according to Steven Marcus's filing with the trademark board. Steven Marcus said he came up with the Alexandria name and symbol as a freshman at Penn. He said he was inspired by a goblet-shaped doumbek drum from Alexandria owned by a college chum.
Joel Marcus credited his son for the concept in a 2014 interview with The New York Times.
“My oldest son, who was at Wharton, came up with the name," he said.
More than two decades later, in November, Alexandria executives learned that RUNLABS was using the trademarks in written fund-raising pitches, according to Alexandria's suit. The pitches said RUNLABS had evolved from Alexandria, featured photographs of Alexandria properties, and mentioned the startup's “pedigree from Alexandria," according to the suit.
RUNLABS plans to provide offices and shared laboratory space to life science firms, and is starting in Europe, with a 150,000-square-foot building that will open in Paris late this year, said Steven Marcus.
After Alexandria executives saw RUNLAB'S pitches, the company complained to Steven Marcus. On Dec. 12, he wrote to Alexandria's board of director that RUNLABS would stop using the name and logo to “remove any further unwanted confusion."
But Alexandria sued him the next day. Gunn, the lawyer for Alexandria, said Steven Marcus's letter was a “transparent dodge" that contained none of the legal assurances his client had sought.
In late January, Steven Marcus asked the trademark board to cancel the trademarks, saying they belong to him.
In his suit filed Thursday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Steven Marcus says that although he was never a paid Alexandria employee, he and an investment firm he founded, Bugsby Property LLC, played a pivotal role in 2013 by helping to develop a new financing strategy for his father's firm.
Rather than issue more common stock, he said, he recommended Alexandria fund growth through a joint venture, ultimately with TIAA, the financial services organization. The new approach lifted Alexandria's sagging stock price and saved his father's job, Steven Marcus said, but he says the elder Marcus took credit for it and “cheated" his son out of payment.
One of Alexandria's lawyers, Randy Mastro, said Steven Marcus signed an agreement in 2013 that said he would not receive money from the firm for the financing plan.
Steven Marcus's effort to get paid now is a “publicity stunt to try to pressure parties to give him something to go away," Mastro said.
Steven Marcus says the agreement was obtained under fraudulent circumstances.
At least one family member appears to side with the elder Marcus.
Brandon Werber, a 33-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur and cousin of Steve Marcus's, said he knows both men well. He isn't surprised by what's happened.
“I had my own professional experience with Steven that ultimately unfolded into what, in my opinion, is quite similar to what Joel and Alexandria are facing with Steven now," Werber said.
He declined to elaborate, but said his uncle is a “genuine role model" with an “unwavering moral compass."
Steven Marcus, for his part, said his cousin is a “complete liar" who has spent little or no time alone with Joel Marcus. The younger Marcus also said he introduced Werber to a high school friend with whom Werber started Lootsie, a loyalty platform for mobile apps.
“He never once thanked me," said Steven Marcus.

Texto completo: "Great nations do not fight endless wars," President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, "I do not support the idea of endless war."
Just a few days before Trump's address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump's defenders say: That's just the foreign policy establishment advocating "forever war." When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?
These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.
In traditional wars, defining victory is easy. Victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called "a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam." There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.
America's enemies have a very clear definition of victory. For them, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. We know this because they have told us so. The 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator "Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting." That is how the terrorists see Obama's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump's planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.
It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. We don't get to decide unilaterally that the war is over. The enemy gets a vote. Just because we have tired of fighting doesn't mean that they have.
Here is the hard truth: We don't get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought over there, in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought over here — on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It's up to us.
Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters." But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, as much as $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.
In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates there are about 20 terrorist groups — including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K — who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, The New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, "says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years."
Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists' necks. They are focused on survival, not on launching faraway attacks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, dust themselves off, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.
In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. "They did not know if they would survive the hour," he said. "They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail."
The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Resumen: In her own handwriting, Elizabeth Warren claimed Native American heritage. It's hard to imagine what she was doing if it wasn't to advance her career.

Texto completo: Another week, another apology from Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her phony claims of Native American heritage. But the latest evidence against her should spell the end of her presidential ambitions.
Sen. Warren’s discredited story of Indian ancestry has made her an object of ridicule coming from President Donald Trump, who dubbed her “Pocahontas,” and conservatives generally who prefer the more pointed “Fauxcahontas. ” Liberals seem to have been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, seemingly accepting each new explanation for her shifting story of how and why she was mistaken for a member of the Cherokee Nation.
Warren’s 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas could put an end to all that. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the signed document in which she wrote that her race was “American Indian. ” This supports the two critical charges against her: that she knowingly and personally claimed Native American heritage, and that she did so for the purpose of career advancement.
Read more commentary:
Elizabeth Warren's 'part' Cherokee claim is a joke, and a racist insult to Natives like me
Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.
Trump's State of the Union address lays smart groundwork for 2020 re-election campaign
On the first count, Warren has consistently dissembled about how and why she came to be thought of as Native American. For example, when the Boston Herald broke the story during her 2012 Senate campaign, Warren said that she had no idea Harvard was saying she was a minority hire, and that she couldn't "recall" having listed herself as such on any job or "other applications. "
The Texas Bar registration shows this isn't true. Also, the document coincides with the year Warren began self-reporting as a "minority professor" in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory. This suggests it was all part of a deliberate plan on her part to adopt a Native American persona. It was also two years after she contributed recipes to the "Pow Wow Chow" Native American cookbook, some of which appear to have been plagiarized from a French chef in The New York Times. In this case, Warren proved she could appropriate from two cultures simultaneously.
Warren used 'ancestry' for career advancement
Why would Warren pretend to be an American Indian in the 1980s if later she downplayed the matter as a misunderstanding based on family lore? Fairly obviously it was for career advancement. Despite the current leftist mania to call out supposed “white privilege,” the fact is that even in the 1980s minority status could confer distinct advantages in hiring and promotion in career fields dominated by liberals for whom affirmative action is an article of faith. For any young academic, identifying as a Native American could be the key edge for landing important faculty slots. As the 1983 guidance from the American Association of University Professors noted, when it comes to filling academic positions, “in the interests of diversity, affirmative action considerations might control the final selection. ”
A 2018 investigation by The Boston Globe found little to support the idea that hiring committees at various law schools where Warren taught openly discussed her alleged Native American heritage as a factor in bringing her on board. Yet, Harvard was quick to tout her as the law school’s first “woman of color,” of which Warren said she was unaware. She was identified as a minority winner of a teaching award at the University of Pennsylvania, apparently also without her knowledge. Maybe these schools did not discuss her supposed ethnicity, but they recognized and exploited it.
Yet whether you believe that diversity-hungry university departments completely ignored Warren’s unique supposed ethnic background, Warren was still trying to game the system. There is no other reasonable explanation for her sudden ethnic shift. She was never a member of a tribe, never lived as part of that culture or heritage, had no even incidental connection other than the alleged family story. It is hard not to conclude that she claimed she was a Native American to get a professional edge.
The troubling implications of bloodline identity
This new evidence comes on the heels of Warren’s apology for the DNA test finding "strong evidence" that she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago. But “by blood” definition of racial identity has troubling implications; it was the tool of segregationists and underpinned the Nuremberg Race Laws in Nazi Germany.
“South Park” and “Portlandia” cleverly satirized people using fractional results of genetic tests to claim new awareness of their victim status. But there can be no meaningful definition of a cultural affiliation based on that factor alone. And DNA evidence is not accepted by the Cherokee Nation anyway, so the whole fiasco shows a terrible sense of judgment — and perhaps panic — on Warren’s part.
It is fair to speculate that Warren’s presidential campaign will soon be over. If Democrats want to nominate a progressive/socialist who will also be a standard-bearer for identity politics, they have other, more authentic choices available. As a nominee, Warren would have to spend the entire campaign explaining to people of color why her candidacy is not a standing indictment of the cynical abuse of affirmative action programs for personal gain. This would be in addition to having to demonstrate to moderates and conservatives why her outdated economic policies would not turn the United States into the next Venezuela.
President Trump said he would love to run against Warren, and she keeps showing why.

Texto completo: Ever since the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, Western fashion brands have been under pressure to investigate and police their own supply chains. Now, a new report from the University of California, Berkeley, shows just how shadowy those supply lines are, as scores of labels rely not just on factories in India but also on exploited home workers.
India is the world's second largest manufacturer and exporter of fashion garments after China, with some 13 million people working in factories within its supply chain alone. But millions more are employed in less formal settings and, according to the report -- titled "Tainted Garments" and written by Siddharth Kara, an expert on contemporary slavery -- many are women and girls from historically oppressed ethnic communities or Muslims who work from home, the majority for long hours and in hazardous conditions, earning as little as 15 cents per hour.
Researchers working with Mr. Kara spoke to 1,452 home workers for the report, published in January, "in the hopes that their otherwise silent voices would be heard and might motivate others to take action to ameliorate the exploitative working conditions many of them endure," he wrote in the introduction.
"Due to the lack of transparency and the informal nature of home-based work, which takes place right at the bottom of the fashion supply chain, the worker has virtually no avenue to seek redress for abusive or unfair conditions," Mr. Kara said in a phone interview this week. "The situation is worsened by the fact that there is little to no regulation or enforcement from the state regarding their work."
In South Asia, Mr. Kara added, the informal economy is populated almost entirely by low caste or religious minorities, who lack access to social systems, education and opportunities.
"These people are the most vulnerable of all. They currently have no other choice other than to accept the exploitative labor conditions offered to them by these fashion sub-suppliers," he said.
Home work -- working from home or a small workshop as opposed to in a factory, often for a subcontractor who is then employed by a supplier for an established company or brand -- has long been a cornerstone of the fast-fashion supply chain. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and China, where millions of low-paid and predominantly female home workers are among the most unprotected in the industry. However, there is also evidence of exploitation in global fashion more broadly. An investigation into the rights of home workers employed within the shadowy luxury industry in Italy was published by The New York Times last September.
The findings from the University of California report constitute some of the most comprehensive assessments of conditions facing home-based garment workers to date. The report shines fresh light on the harsh realities of the practice, including the use of child and forced labor. In northern India, where most of the 1,452 workers interviewed were located, about 76 percent started their home-based work because of "some form of duress," including severe financial hardship, family pressure or lack of alternate income. The youngest individual interviewed was 10 years old; up to 19 percent of the workers were between 10 and 18 years old.
Most of the women and girls interviewed for the report said they are tasked with the "finishing touches" of a garment: embroidery, tasseling, fringing, beadwork and buttons. None belonged to a trade union, or had a written agreement for their work, and more than 99 percent were paid less than the state-stipulated minimum wage under Indian law. Minimum wage for an eight-hour work day ranges from the equivalent of $3.08 (39 cents per hour for unskilled work in the state of Rajasthan) to $8.44 ($1.05 per hour for work in New Delhi). According to the report, most home workers received between 50 percent and 90 percent less than they were owed. And approximately 85 percent exclusively worked in supply chains for the export of apparel products to the United States and the European Union.
"Their days amount to little more than running the home and working as many hours as they can to meet these orders, cooped up inside," Mr. Kara said, noting that injury and chronic illness, including back pain and diminishing eyesight, were common complaints as a result of the monotonous work, which is often fulfilled in dusty or dirty environments and with no medical care offered by the subcontractors.
"We cannot leave this work even though we are treated so badly. If we leave this work, the company will never give us work again," said one 36-year-old garment worker from near Jaipur whose account was detailed in the report. None of those interviewed were named, for fear that they would lose their livelihoods or their families would be punished for speaking out. The women said that labor subcontractors, who typically are male, were often verbally abusive or intimidating to secure compliance.
The report also stated that few of the brands or companies who employ these workers in their supply chain were aware that this work was being outsourced to home workers, or of the conditions many home workers faced. Foreign brands found to be involved -- "largely household names," said Mr. Kara -- were not named in the report in an effort to discourage them from pulling out of contracts or from limiting economic opportunity.
"We could name and shame them, but it could be more successful to try and take a more constructive avenue here," Mr. Kara said. "These women and girls may only earn pennies but they are crucial ones. If the brands simply pulled out and they lost their home work, it could be disastrous for them and their families."
Instead, the researchers encouraged those brands and companies to use their size and leverage with local suppliers to invest in improving transparency and worker rights along the supply chain. The report recommends that home workers be given a garment-specific union and written contracts for their work, and that there should be an increase in the level of investigation and prosecution of those who exploit the workers.
"I hope the information presented in this report will stimulate a sustained commitment by all stakeholders to address the unjust and exploitative conditions uncovered," Mr. Kara said.

Texto completo: James McManus, the last of the Tammany Hall Democratic Party bosses, died at home Monday. He was 84.
McManus, the district leader in Hell's Kitchen for over 50 years, headed up the McManus Midtown District Club.
His great-grand-uncle, Thomas McManus, who was elected to the state assembly in 1892, founded the McManus Club, which ran politics in the district. James took it over in 1963.
In a New York Times interview in 2017, McManus spoke about the dwindling power of the district leader. "In the old days, you could get people jobs, take care of their problems, help with their daily life," he told the paper. "But you just can't help anybody anymore. You can't even take care of a jury notice."

Texto completo: The effectiveness of President Trump's State of the Union address depends largely on whom you ask. The president Tuesday used his annual opportunity to speak directly to the American people to highlight his priorities, including immigration, as another funding deadline looms and the 2020 presidential campaign season begins in earnest.
Major national newspapers noted the split personality of the speech: an appeal to unity and healing followed by direct and sometimes vivid attacks on Democrats over immigration and abortion rights.
Here's a roundup of some of the commentary:
Governor Andrew Cuomo: Trump spread disinformation about abortion
Cuomo, whose state of New York was called out specifically by President Trump as he asked Congress to pass a ban on late-term abortion Tuesday, wrote in The New York Times of the urgency the state has felt to update its pre-Roe v. Wade abortion laws in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.
Cuomo said of the president's speech:
“Mr. Trump and the religious right are spreading falsehoods about New York's law to inflame their base. Activists on the far right continue to mislead with the ridiculous claim that the act will allow abortions up to a minute before birth."
Michael A. Cohen, The Boston Globe: Nothing matters with this president
Columnist Michael A. Cohen argued Trump's State of the Union speech merely demonstrated his “persistent inability to tell the truth."
“No two words better sum up the Trump era than 'nothing matters.' They are a reminder that a) no matter the excess or outrage President Trump sparks, it will have no effect on how his supporters perceive him and b) nothing the president says actually matters. When you have a president who lies constantly, changes policies on a whim, and whose word is largely worthless, how can anyone take what he says seriously?"
Dan Balz, The Washington Post: Trump changed few minds
Washington Post political reporter Dan Balz wrote that the exercise Tuesday night did not do much to move the country: “There was little new in his address. Even if there were, the president was speaking to a country that for the most part has firm convictions about their feelings toward him. His poll numbers have moved little during two years in office, hovering in one of the narrowest ranges of any modern president. His floor and his ceiling appear to be relatively close together."
The Wall Street Journal editorial board: More substantive than Twitter rants
The right-leaning editorial board of the Wall Street Journal disagrees with Balz, noting most Americans are not policy obsessives and were probably hearing about some of Trump's initiatives — particularly prison reform — for the first time.
“Mr. Trump likes these moments before Congress, no doubt because he savors the political theater. But they are also notable — and perhaps instructive to Americans who won't follow politics obsessively — because they are among the few times he bothers to make an extended argument about political substance."
Fox News analysis: Trump rejected 'creeping' socialism
Greg Wilson and Gregg Re of Fox News described Democrats shifting “uncomfortably in their seats" as Trump condemned socialism Tuesday. Wilson and Re said the divide over socialism represented the sharpest split between the two parties.
“The vow from Trump, whose speech was delayed a week amid a partial government shutdown, came as Democrats have proposed an evolving agenda of 'Medicare-for-all,' free college tuition, minimum wage increases and even guaranteed basic income."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democrats considering taking on President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted to his State of the Union address with outrage, sarcasm and eye rolling.
While the official Democratic response was given by Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who ran unsuccessfully to be governor of Georgia, the many potential presidential hopefuls tried to get into the conversation.
"Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour – to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great," tweeted former Vice President Joe Biden.
Four senators who are actively campaigning for the 2020 nomination had seats among the first two rows of Democratic lawmakers during Trump's speech: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are also considering jumping into the race.
A few rows away, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who ran as a Democrat in 2016 and could run again, scribbled notes on a manila envelope for part of Trump's speech.
"How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?" Sanders tweeted afterward.
When cameras caught Gillibrand in a dramatic eye roll during the address, she tried to turn the moment into campaign gold.
"Agree? Chip in $5 so we can put an end to this," she tweeted.
Senators also sent messages through guests they'd invited to the speech.
Gillibrand brought a transgender Navy lieutenant commander to illustrate her opposition to Trump's ban on transgender Americans serving in the military.
Warren and Harris both brought federal workers who had been furloughed during the partial government shutdown.
Klobuchar – who announced after the speech that she will be making a "big announcement" Sunday – brought a woman whose son died because he was not able to afford insulin.
"7 million Americans have lost health insurance under this President," tweeted Julian Castro, a former Obama Cabinet member and San Antonio mayor. "We need Medicare for All now. "
Brown highlighted a New York Times fact check that labeled as "false" Trump's claim that the American economy is considered "far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. "
"Just leaving this here," Brown said in his tweet.
Others responded to Trump's boast that no one has benefited more the strong economy than women.
"President Trump seems not to understand that the female jobs he created were Democratic women in Congress," Gillibrand tweeted.
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, likewise thanked the president "for the tremendous role you played in getting Democratic women elected to Congress in record numbers!"
One of Harris' strongest reactions was to Trump's attacks on efforts in New York and Virginia to loosen restrictions on abortions performed later in pregnancies.
"Politicians should not tell women what to do with their bodies," Harris tweeted, putting emoji claps between each word for emphasis.
Trump's insistence on building a wall along the border with Mexico also got pushback from potential candidates.
Responding to Trump's call to "choose greatness," former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said "greatness begins with immigrants. "
"Choosing greatness starts with understanding that," he tweeted. "And it means choosing real solutions to our broken immigration system over gimmicks like a wall. "
Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said Trump should take his own advice – and choose greatness instead of "pursuing policies that stoke fear in communities and families across the nation. "

Top commander denies peace deal reached with the Taliban

Texto completo: The top American military commander in charge of Afghanistan told Congress Tuesday that reports of a tentative peace deal with the Taliban have been overstated.

“First of all there have been no agreements that have actually been finalized,” said Gen. Joseph Votel, the U.S. Central Commander, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Votel was being questioned by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., about reports in the New York Times and elsewhere last month that U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had agreed in principle to a framework deal under which the Taliban would guarantee Afghan territory is never used by terrorists.

Votel said the “framework” was a means for “continuing discussions moving forward,” simply one step in a long process that would eventually lead to direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

And he insisted that the U.S. was not abandoning the principle that the peace talks had to be “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.”

“Ambassador Khalilzad's efforts are done with the knowledge of the government of Afghanistan,” Votel said.

“Ultimately, we need to get to a Taliban, Afghanistan discussion, only they will be able to resolve the key issues involved in the dispute.”

Asked by Sen. Martha McSally R-Ariz., how he would define what winning looks like in Afghanistan after more than 17 years of war.

“It looks like two things to me. It looks like a negotiated settlement, and it looks like safeguarding out national interests,” Votel said. “I think the strategy we have in place is the right one. We’ve got to stay focused on this.”

Is 'Mary Poppins' racist and using blackface? Twitter is not having it

Texto completo: A U. S. professor is deeming the classic 1964 film "Mary Poppins" racist, accusing Julie Andrews of "blacking up" her face with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps.
In a New York Times op-ed called "'Mary Poppins,' and a Nanny’s Shameful Flirting With Blackface," Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner slammed the iconic dance scene where Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's Bert on a rooftop for the song "Step In Time. "
"When the magical nanny … accompanies her young charges, Michael and Jane Banks, up their chimney, her face gets covered in soot, but instead of wiping it off, she gamely powders her nose and cheeks even blacker," Pollack-Pelzner wrote.
Related: Julie Andrews and Emily Blunt were both new moms making 'Mary Poppins'
The Linfield College literature professor linked the scene to racism in P. L. Travers' novels, which he claims "associate chimney sweeps’ blackened faces with racial caricatures. "
Pollack-Pelzner also took aim at naval officer Admiral Boom, who ordered his cannons fired at the "cheeky devils" on the roof after mistaking the dark figures of the chimney sweeps for "Hottentots," a racial slur.
"These aren’t really black Africans; they’re grinning white dancers in blackface," he wrote. "It’s a parody of black menace; it’s even posted on a white nationalist website as evidence of the film’s racial hierarchy. "
‘Mary Poppins Returns’: Everything we know about the musical sequel
Pollack-Pelzner's observations didn't sit well with many fans of the classic family film.
@Sherri_Garver questioned: "Ummm Seriously? #MaryPoppins is now in the Cross hair? THEY WERE CHIMNEY SWEEPERS!!! NOT "BLACK FACE IMPERSONATORS. "
"Mary Poppins wasn’t flirting with black face! It was soot in their faces from being a chimney!" user @Jencon1978 added. "Stopped spreading racism claims on non racist things like this!"
@AmandaEliasch said it's the, "end of the world when Hollywood thinks Mary Poppins is racist. "
And user @coldxman said, "People are searching for racism like it's oil. … If it were a literal commodity, however, it's value would be through the roof at this moment in history. "
The Emily Blunt-led 2018 sequel "Mary Poppins Returns" is currently nominated for several Academy Awards, including best costume design, production design and original score, as well as best original song for "The Place Where Lost Things Go. "

Texto completo: A mysterious Instagram account with a picture of an egg — which, gasp, broke Kylie Jenner's record for likes on a single post — revealed its identity shortly after the Super Bowl following nearly a month of suspense. What it's promoting: A mental health awareness campaign.
On Jan. 4, the Instagram account @world_record_egg made a post with a stock-like image of a brown egg about surpassing Jenner, stating, "Let’s set a world record together and get the most liked post on Instagram. Beating the current world record held by Kylie Jenner (18 million)!"
The post succeeded. Currently, it has over 52 million likes, and the account itself has 10 million followers.
Though the brown egg was the first post of the account at the time, on Jan. 18, the account posted another photo of a brown egg. However, this time, the egg had a crack in the top left corner, and the post had no caption. In two subsequent posts — one on Jan. 22 and the other on Jan. 29 — the brown egg had more cracks. Then, on Feb. 1, the account made a huge announcement: The identity of the egg would be revealed.
With a picture of a cracked egg and football laces, the post read, "The wait is over . . . All will be revealed this Sunday following the Super Bowl . . . Watch it first, only on @hulu. "
This post sent the Internet into a frenzy, as many curious users tried to figure out the identity of the mysterious egg. Hulu put an end to all the questions Sunday at 8 p. m. PST/11 p. m. EST, as a 30-second episode entitled "The Reveal" of the show "World Record Egg" disclosed that the egg is tied to a mental health awareness campaign concerning social media use.
At the start of the episode, the egg — which is slightly cracked, has drawn-on eyes and makes some sounds — introduces itself. Then, it notes, "Recently I've started to crack. The pressure of social media is getting to me. "
The egg then makes a direct plea to viewers, stating, "If you're struggling too, talk to someone. " The final still of the episode directs viewers to mentalhealthamerica. net.
The site belongs to Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909 that is "dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting the overall mental health of all Americans. " The organization currently has over 200 affiliates in 41 states.
Twitter users had varying reactions to the announcement. While some were disappointed, others applauded the campaign to spread mental health awareness.
The email account listed on world_record_egg's Instagram page did not immediately reply to USA TODAY's request for comment.
The person behind the mysterious egg was revealed to be Chris Godfrey, 29, who works in advertising at The & Partnership in London, according to the New York Times. Two friends helped him launch the viral account, which Godfrey told the Times will continue to promote positivity.

This is not the first time the State of the Union wasn't 'on schedule' or 'on location'

Texto completo: President Donald Trump agreed late Wednesday to postpone his State of the Union address after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told him he would not be invited to give the speech to a joint session of Congress in the House of Representatives' chamber until the partial government shutdown is resolved.
Although the president considered delivering the address somewhere else, Trump said he decided to wait because there is "no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. "
Trump's decision was a reversal from his position earlier Wednesday when he insisted in a letter that he would deliver the speech in the House despite Pelosi's security concerns.
"It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!" he wrote in the letter.
Trump: I will wait until 'Shutdown is over' to give State of the Union in the House
Opinion: Shutdown is no time for celebratory State of the Union. No time is. Let's scrap it.
In response to Pelosi's move, many politicians and political pundits mourned the death of yet another political norm.
While this appears to be the first time a House speaker has declined to allow the president to deliver his remarks, it is far from the first time that a State of the Union address was not delivered "on schedule" and "on location. " According to the House Office of the Historian and the Clerk of the House's Office of Art and Archives, in the 230 years since George Washington's first term began, 95 State of the Union addresses were delivered in person; 83 of those were delivered once Woodrow Wilson restarted the custom in 1913.
Here is a look at the speech's fluid history:
It was postponed once before
President Ronald Reagan's 1986 State of the Union address was originally scheduled to take place on Jan. 28, but that morning the Challenger space shuttle broke apart after takeoff, killing all seven people on board.
In response to the tragedy, Reagan delayed his speech until Feb. 4. The New York Times reported at the time that it was the first time the State of the Union had been rescheduled.
The first 12 were not delivered before the House
America's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, delivered their messages in the Senate, not the House, chamber. And because all but one of those addresses predated the move of the capital city to Washington, they were given in New York and Philadelphia.
The U. S. Capitol was open in time for Adams' 1800 address, but that was given in the old Senate chamber.
It was delivered in writing for more than 100 years
For more than a century, the State of the Union was submitted to Congress in writing and there was no speech given by the president.
President Thomas Jefferson, elected in 1800, ended the practice of delivering the address in person before a joint session of Congress. The submission of a written message remained the norm until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson became the first president to deliver the address from the House floor.
This did not end the practice of submitting the address in writing. Wilson himself did so in 1919 and 1920. President Calvin Coolidge gave his in writing from 1924 to 1928. President Herbert Hoover did the same from 1929 to 1932, as did Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 and 1945, Harry Truman in 1946 and 1953, Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 and 1961, Richard Nixon in 1973, and Jimmy Carter in 1981.
For most of U. S. history, it wasn't even called the State of the Union
The address was formally called the Annual Message from 1790 to 1946. It was not until 1947 that it officially became the State of the Union Address.
It used to be in December
Although the State of the Union is now delivered at the end of January, or sometimes in early February, it was traditionally given in December (or sometimes November, and on one occasion in October). That changed with the ratification of the 20th amendment in 1933, which moved the opening of Congress from March to January.

Texto completo: James Ingram - The Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, who topped the charts with hits including "Baby, Come to Me" and "Somewhere Out There," has died, according to his close friend, actress Debbie Allen. The musician was 66.
TMZ reported Tuesday (Jan. 29, 2019) that Mr. Ingram had died of brain cancer.
Mr. Ingram was nominated for a whopping 14 Grammys and took home two trophies throughout his decades-long career, which started when he left his hometown of Akron, Ohio, for Los Angeles at 18 with his band Revelation Funk. The group soon disbanded, but Ingram stuck around in Hollywood, singing and playing piano in studio sessions with Ray Charles and recording vocals for Marvin Gaye.
Mr. Ingram's career took off in 1981 when Quincy Jones included his song "Just Once" on his album "The Dude."
Albert J. Dunlap - The hired-gun CEO, who presided over nearly a dozen corporations and grew profits while firing thousands of employees in the name of efficiency and cutting costs, has died.
Mr. Dunlap was 81 when he died Jan. 25 (2019) at his home in Ocala, Fla.
He turned around the bottom lines of companies including a disposable-cup company, ketchup bottle manufacturer and toilet-paper giant. An unabashed proponent of downsizing, he became known as "Chainsaw Al," "the Shredder" and "Rambo in Pinstripes," while his own name entered the corporate lexicon as a verb -- "to Dunlap" -- for turning a wayward company into a high-flying success.
But he went on to face allegations of smoke-and-mirrors accounting that led to his 1998 ouster from Sunbeam, a small-appliance company, and to news reports that unearthed similar fraud allegations earlier in his career. He never faced criminal charges. But in 2002, he agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $500,000 to settle the Sunbeam allegations and was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
Florence Knoll Bassett - The architect and designer, who changed the look and feel of corporate offices with a "total design" concept through open floor plans, spare, straight-edged desks and furnishings and a devotion to aesthetic simplicity, died Jan. 25 (2019) at her home in Coral Gables, Fla. She was 101.
Her death was confirmed by David Bright, a spokesman for Knoll International, the design and furniture company she once led.
Although she designed some buildings, Ms. Knoll Bassett was best known for her reimagining of interior space, as she cleared away the heavy desks and draperies that had cluttered offices for years.
James F. Parker - The man who led Southwest Airlines through the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks has died. He was 72.
Mr. Parker died unexpectedly on Jan. 26 (2019) according to Southwest.
Mr. Parker was a lawyer in San Antonio and former state assistant attorney general before joining Dallas-based Southwest in 1986. He was general counsel in June 2001 when he was named to replace the carrier's co-founder, Herb Kelleher, as CEO. The terrorist attacks undermined air travel; other airlines cut thousands of jobs. Southwest remained profitable and avoided layoffs, but Mr. Parker's tenure was also marked by rising tension with the flight attendants' union. Mr. Parker stepped down in July 2004.
Eka Tjipta Widjaja - The patriarch of one of Asia's richest families and the founder of a sprawling Indonesian conglomerate has died. He was 97.
Mr. Widjaja died on Jan. 26 (2019), according to Gandi Sulistiyanto, a managing director at the Sinarmas conglomerate.
The son of migrants from Fujian in China, Mr. Widjaja was a coconut oil trader on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the 1930s before building businesses in palm oil, pulp and paper and mining. Forbes estimated Mr. Widjaja's fortune at $8.6 billion last year, making him Indonesia's third-richest person and the family among the 25 richest in Asia.
He had several wives, and according to some reports as many as 40 children.
Sinarmas is known for the record $14 billion default of its Asia Pulp and Paper business in 2001. Earlier this decade it became an international pariah as Greenpeace campaigned against its destruction of Indonesia's rainforests.
Morton Sobell - The ardent communist operative, convicted with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the sensational 1951 atomic bomb spy trial, died Dec. 26 (2018) in Manhattan. He had steadfastly denied guilt for decades, then abruptly acknowledged complicity in 2008.
His death, at 101, was confirmed by his son, Mark Sobell, who did not cite a specific cause.
Mr. Sobell, who was spared the death penalty imposed on the Rosenbergs, served almost 18 years of a 30-year sentence in federal prison for his role in the Soviet espionage case that gripped the nation. The Rosenbergs were executed in 1953 amid the Cold War anti-communist fervor.
In his dramatic turnaround confession in September 2008, Mr. Sobell, then 91, admitted in a New York Times interview that he had indeed stolen classified military documents for the Soviet Union near the end of World War II and afterward.
Harold Bradley - The Country Music Hall of Fame guitarist, who played on hundreds of hit country records including "Crazy," "King of the Road" and "Crying" and helped create "The Nashville Sound" with his brother Owen, died at the age of 93.
His daughter Beverly Bradley said he died Thursday (Jan. 31, 2019) in Nashville, Tenn., where he was born. No cause of death was given.
The Bradley brothers had a huge impact on Nashville during the 1950s and beyond, with Harold serving as a member of the "A Team" of session musicians and Owen leading Decca Records. Mr. Bradley played on songs for Hank Williams, Eddy Arnold, the Everly Brothers, Burl Ives, Red Foley, Anita Bryant, Patsy Cline and Elvis Presley.
Leonard Dinnerstein - The historian and authority on anti-Semitism who distinguished himself with his doctoral dissertation, first published as "The Leo Frank Case" in 1968, has died.
Mr. Dinnerstein, a professor for more than 30 years at the University of Arizona, where he helped build the Judaic studies program, died Jan. 22 (2019) at his home in Tucson. He was 84.
The cause was renal failure, said his daughter, Julie Dinnerstein.
His subsequent volumes, among them "Anti-Semitism in America" (1994), established him more broadly as a scholar of that ancient prejudice -- its roots, its flare-ups and the ways in which it has been overcome, or not, in modern America.

Texto completo: ALL THE LIVES WE EVER LIVED:
Seeking Solace in Virginia Woolf
By Katharine Smyth
Crown, 308 pp., $26
“Perhaps there is one book for every life," Katharine Smyth writes in the first sentence of her memoir, “All the Lives We Ever Lived." For her, that book is Virginia Woolf's “To the Lighthouse," and as if to prove her point she braids readings from it with threads of her past to create a reflective meditation on loss, childhood, memory, home, and art.
Smyth's account is only obliquely about herself; though the narrator, she's a shadow character in a story that's mostly about her father. She recalls her childhood with her parents in Boston and Rhode Island but writes equally vividly about her father's life in London and Cambridge before she is born. She is equal parts daughter and reporter, describing her father's larger-than-life persona, his alcoholism, his career as an architect and financial struggles, his marriage to her mother, and his long illness and eventual death during her early adulthood. Throughout, she draws on “To the Lighthouse" as well as Woolf's other writing and biography, using them as windows into her life and mind.
“All the Lives We Ever Lived" is a quiet book and, like its literary touchstone, an intensely interior one. In one close reading of a scene, Smyth observes that Woolf is the master of “moments that hold up a mirror to our private tumult while also revealing how much we as humans share." The same can certainly be said of Smyth, who expertly dissects the finest gradations of emotion in any given scene: the moment her father tries to drunkenly discuss one of his favorite novels with her, for example, while she brushes her teeth. She turns him away, then wishes he'd come back, then thinks of his impending death, then goes to sleep.
Smyth is a restrained writer. She exposes intimate details of her own world and that of her parents but omits more than she shares. This is especially true of her life away from her family; we only get the contours. Perhaps one of the most moving moments in the book — a chills-down-the-spine moment — comes early, in a chapter on courtship and marriage, both that of her parents and of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. She writes, “When I was thirty, I married a man I'd dated for five years; four years later, he left in the middle of the night, and I never saw him again." She hardly mentions this again.
Her reticence coupled with her candor are refreshing. It's a model of writing about oneself that emphasizes focus and control over unbridled openness. Some of the best scenes — like Woolf's — are richly descriptive of the external world: “From the basin to the river to the bay to the sea: At the edge of the Atlantic, we lost sight of the land, so the world seemed naught but sky and water, and we the center, always the center."
Given all the similarities — the death of a parent, a life shaped by water and houses — it's no surprise that Smyth turns to “To the Lighthouse" as the book for her life. “All the Lives We Ever Lived" joins a genre that's in vogue: memoir that blends the personal with literary criticism, and sometimes history. Leslie Jamison's “The Recovering" falls into this category, as does Maggie Nelson's “The Argonauts." When done well, this approach can be illuminating; art backlighting the contradictions and tangles of a life.
In the case of “All the Lives We Ever Lived," this approach sometimes works. The strength lies in Smyth's gifted critical reading — the close, multifaceted dissection of Woolf's words. She can turn a passage inside-out. As a frustrated tutor once noted while she was studying abroad at Oxford she has a keen “intuitive sense of Woolf," if not a consistently scholarly one. That blend of the critical and the emotional enlivens our sense of Woolf and of her.
But like many books that trade in both memoir and criticism, Smyth's is somewhat lopsided. The passages about her own life tend to be the most compelling. The constant and predictable shift to Virginia or Mrs. Ramsay can feel like a downturn. There is rarely an elegant way to mesh these dimensions together, which is perhaps why a writer like Nelson used a more fragmentary approach, letting things hang together as they will.
Still, “All the Lives We Ever Lived" is a powerful book, driven by the engine of Smyth's controlled, rich description. It's an astonishingly clear-eyed portrait of a person through myriad lenses, a kind of prismatic attempt to capture a life.

Gladys Bentley

Texto completo: WHEN IT COMES to loosening social mores, progress that isn't made in private has often taken place onstage.
That was certainly the case at the Clam House, a Prohibition-era speakeasy in Harlem, where Gladys Bentley, one of the boldest performers of her era, held court.
In her top hat and tuxedo, Bentley belted gender-bending original blues numbers and lewd parodies of popular songs, eventually becoming Harlem royalty. When not accompanying herself with a dazzling piano, the mightily built singer often swept through the audience, flirting with women in the crowd and soliciting dirty lyrics from them as she sang.
By the early 1930s, Bentley was Harlem's most famous lesbian figure -- a significant distinction, given that gay, lesbian and gender-defying writers and performers were flourishing during the Harlem Renaissance. For a time, she was among the best-known black entertainers in the United States.
Bentley sang her bawdy, bossy songs in a thunderous voice, dipping down into a froglike growl or curling upward into a wail. In his 1940 autobiography, Langston Hughes called her "an amazing exhibition of musical energy -- a large, dark, masculine lady, whose feet pounded the floor while her fingers pounded the keyboard -- a perfect piece of African sculpture, animated by her own rhythm."
In a letter to Countee Cullen, the Harlem socialite Harold Jackman wrote: "When Gladys sings 'St. James Infirmary,' it makes you weep your heart out."
Indeed, Bentley knew her success was built on talent as much as notoriety. "The world has tramped to the doors of the places where I have performed to applaud my piano playing and song styling," she wrote in a 1952 essay for Ebony. "Even though they knew me as a male impersonator, they still could appreciate my artistry as a performer."
Bentley's rise to fame demonstrated how liberated the Prohibition culture of the Harlem Renaissance had become, and how welcoming the blues tradition could be to gay expression. She often confronted male entitlement and sexual abuse in her lyrics, and declared her own sexual independence. This was, in fact, the continuation of a tradition begun by other singers of the early 20th century, particularly Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and Lucille Bogan, who were some of the most vocal musician critics of patriarchy of their time.
But Bentley was the first prominent performer of her era to embrace a trans identity, implicating her body differently in these acts of musical defiance. (Throughout her life, Bentley used female pronouns to describe herself -- at least in public.)
On a 1928 recording of her "Worried Blues," for OKeh Records, Bentley sang: "What made you men folk treat us women like you do? / I don't want no man that I got to give my money to."
Between lines, she improvises vocal fills, uncannily mimicking a trumpet and hitting the notes spot on. On "How Much Can I Stand," from later that year, she depicted an abusive relationship with a sense of wry humanity:
Women selling snakeskins and alligator tails
Trying to get money to get my man out of jail
How much of that dog can I stand?
Said I was an angel, he was bound to treat me right
Who in the devil ever heard of angels that get beat up every night?
How much of that dog can I stand?
Gladys Bentley was born on Aug. 12, 1907, to Mary Bentley, who was from Trinidad, and George Bentley, an American, and she was raised in Philadelphia. (While most sources list Philadelphia as Bentley's birthplace, during a rare TV appearance in 1958, she told Groucho Marx that she was originally from Port of Spain, Trinidad.)
The eldest of four siblings, Bentley remembered her childhood as an unhappy one, and from an early age her parents worried about her attraction to women. But she poured her frustrations and self interrogations into music, and her talents as a pianist and songwriter showed themselves quickly. In 1923, at 16, she left home for New York City, where the Harlem Renaissance was already in high gear.
Bentley immediately began performing at house parties and at so-called buffet flats. These were illicit clubs, usually in brownstones, that offered music, alcohol, gambling and often prostitution. But it was at the Clam House -- Harlem's most popular gay-friendly speakeasy, on 133rd Street, nicknamed Swing Street for its countless underground clubs -- that Bentley established herself as the main attraction.
Her reputation took off. The house became the talk of Harlem, attracting uptown bigwigs as well as celebrities from all over the city. Bentley's performances there inspired characters in at least three novels based on Harlem's night life, including Carl Van Vechten's voyeuristic "Parties."
The Clam House appears prominently on the cartoonist Elmer Simms Campbell's "Night-Club Map of Harlem." In the center of the image, just off Seventh Avenue, Campbell drew a sketch of Bentley at the piano, writing, "Gladys' Clam House: Gladys Bentley wears a tuxedo and high hat."
Bentley recorded intermittently in the '20s and '30s, but none of the recordings capture the licentious immersion of her live performances, and she was not widely played on the radio.
Instead, Bentley became a fixture of clubs across the city and eventually toured nationally. At the height of her fame, she said in the Ebony essay, she was living on Park Avenue with a team of servants, paying $300 a month in rent (over $5,000 in today's dollars) and driving a luxury car. She told reporters that she had married a white woman at a ceremony in New Jersey, though the woman's identity does not appear to have become public.
In the mid-30s, Bentley was the headliner at the Ubangi Club, running a stage show that featured flamboyantly dressed men dancing in a chorus line behind her. Advertisements for the show stated that she was in charge of a "cast of 30." She sometimes appeared at the Apollo Theater and the Cotton Club, and held a residency at a club on Park Avenue in Midtown.
During Prohibition, lines blurred between mainstream night life and more illicit forms of entertainment. But over the course of the '30s, after the 18th Amendment was repealed and the country found itself in the Depression, tolerance waned. Even as Bentley grew more popular, her celebrity became less acceptable -- and performing south of Harlem became difficult. In 1934, a run at the King's Terrace on 52nd Street was cut short under pressure from the police.
In 1937, Bentley left New York for Los Angeles. She became a leading entertainer there and in the Bay Area, though she sometimes had to wear skirts onstage to appease club owners. She was less restricted at Mona's 440 Club, the first lesbian bar in San Francisco, which became her home base for a time.
The Red Scare brought a new wave of repressive social politics, and McCarthyite attacks on artists placed a particular target on homosexuals. Bentley never stopped touring, but she began to appear consistently in women's clothing, and in the 1950s she claimed to have gotten married twice to men. (One of them, the journalist J. T. Gibson, denied it.) In 1952, the same year she signed a recording contract with the Swingtime label, she wrote in the Ebony essay (titled "I Am a Woman Again") that she had undergone hormone treatments to help her identify as heterosexual.
By 1958, she said she had completed an autobiography, "If This Be Sin," but it was never published. Bentley died in 1960, from complications of the flu, at 52, while studying to become a Christian minister.
For a time, she had been a monarch of the New York night: The simple mention of her name was enough to clue readers in. In October 1936, a New York Times entertainment columnist wrote: "The Ubangi Club, Harlem's reigning hot spot, will offer a brand new revue tomorrow evening, featuring (of course) Gladys Bentley."
In another article that month, The Times described the scene she cultivated: "The Ubangi still draws a mixed crowd, is noisy and intimate and gay -- altogether Harlem."

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: TYNGSBORO -- Can an action taken in China affect Tyngsboro taxpayers? The question may sound like a paraphrase of the "butterfly effect" question, but the answer is "yes."

Once the primary destination for recyclables from the United States and other industrial nations, in 2018 the Asian nation banned these materials.

This decision is driving up the town's waste collection budget. In addition, constant changes to recycling regulations complicate matters.

"It keeps people guessing," said Town Health Agent Kerri Oun.

At a joint meeting of the Board of Selectmen, Finance Committee, and School Committee earlier this month, Town Administrator Matthew Hanson advised the boards that the waste collection account is trending over budget in large part because recycling has become very expensive.

Ten years ago, he said, people were told they did not have to worry about cleaning recycling material. Now, they must. Tyngsboro's trash and recycling contractor, Republic Services, can return any recycling pick up that contains food or other organic matter.

One of the reasons China banned recyclables from the U.S., according to published reports, is that they were dirty, which was harming its environment.

Environmental regulations in Massachusetts compound the problem, according to Hanson.

Oun concurs. She notes six months ago yogurt containers were banned. Now, they are acceptable again.

On one recent morning, Oun was on the phone taking a call from a resident about K-Cups, which popular opinion says cannot be recycled. Looking the item up on the web site www.recyclesmart.ma.org, however, Oun discovered that it is possible to recycle this favorite of coffee drinkers with some important caveats.

Coffee consumers must separate the components of a K-Cup. It is a combination of plastic, aluminum, coffee grounds and a paper filter. The K-Cup as a whole cannot be recycled, but all its separated components can.

Moreover, throw that paper cup from your favorite coffee shop right in the trash. According to www.recyclesmart.ma.org, paper coffee cups cannot be recycled.

Donna McPartlan, the Health Department's administrative assistant, says that some items can be recycled on a seasonal basis. For example, she said, residents can recycle gift bags and cards during the Christmas holiday season, but not at other times of the year. The ties and handles are the problem.

Moreover, not all items labeled recyclable are actually appropriate for curbside pickup. Plastic shopping bags, which will soon be outlawed in Massachusetts, are a prime example, according to McParlan.

Using these plastic bags as recycling containers contaminates an entire batch because the handles can jam the recycling system. Any item that might cause a machine to jam is not recyclable, McParlan explains. For example, old cassette tapes are also banned.

"People try to recycle everything," Oun says. This behavior is not unique to Tyngsboro. A New York Times article termed it "aspirational recycling" and a USA Today article called it "hopeful recycling."

The Tyngsboro recycling rate -- the amount of waste set aside for recycling -- hovers at around 25 percent. The U.S. rate is just under 35 percent, compared to Germany's 56 percent.

"Everyone has good intentions," Oun said. She added, "When in doubt check it out."

Trump: Cory Booker's 'got no chance' at the White House

Texto completo: President Trump dismissed Sen. Cory Booker's presidential ambitions on Friday, boasting he would trounce the Democratic nominee who emerges from the ever-growing primary field.

Booker, of New Jersey, is the latest Democrat to announce he will seek the party's nomination to challenge Trump for the White House in 2020. The 49-year-old former mayor of Newark, a vegan and bachelor educated at Stanford, Yale, and Oxford, waited until the start of Black History Month to formally declare his candidacy.

"He's got no chance," Trump told CBS News of Booker. "Because I know him. I don’t think he has a chance."

The president, whose own re-election campaign announced on Thursday that he raised $21 million in the last financial quarter of 2018, said Friday "so far" he hadn't seen a single Democratic candidate who could oust him from the Oval Office.

"I don't," Trump said. "I'm not impressed with their group."

Trump had earlier weighed in on the slew of Democratic contenders in an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday. He told the newspaper the party had “really drifted far left,” describing Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as damaged after his sustained attacks on her over her claims to Native American ancestry.

“I would say the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,” he said of the California senator, who officially launched her campaign last week during a rally in Oakland, Calif.” “I would say in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her. A better crowd — better crowd, better enthusiasm.”

Texto completo: The 19th Biennial Festival of New Music is underway at Florida State University's College of Music and will continue through Saturday.
The festival includes masterclasses and presentations by guest artists, plus seven different concerts featuring acoustic and electroacoustic compositions for both small and large ensembles. Except for the Saturday evening closing concert, all events are free and open to the public.
Georg Friedrich Haas is the featured composer for this year's festival. Haas has taught at the University of the Arts in Graz and at the Music Academy in Basel. In 2013, he was appointed professor of music at Columbia University in New York and since then has taught composition there.
Haas feels both rooted in the European tradition and strongly influenced by the aesthetic freedom of American composers like Charles Ives, Harry Partch, John Cage and James Tenney. He also has repeatedly referenced the musical mysticism of composers Giacinto Scelsi and Ivan Wyschnegradsky.
The featured performing artists for this festival are members of the Meitar Ensemble. Praised by the New York Times for their "excellence, poise and precision," the Meitar Ensemble, founded in 2004 by artistic director Amit Dolberg, has established itself as a prominent array of virtuosos specializing in contemporary music.
Compositions written by 30 composers across the country were selected by College of Music faculty from among almost 1,000 entries.
Schedule for the 19th Biennial Festival of New Music:
• Friday (10:10 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 2 p.m.): Chamber Music, Opperman Music Hall
• Friday (7:30 p.m.) Meitar Ensemble
• Saturday (2 p.m.): Concert of electronic and electroacoustic music, Opperman Music Hall
• Saturday Closing Concert (7:30 p.m.): FSU Symphony Orchestra and Wind Orchestra, soloist Greg Sauer, in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall
The FSU College of Music has hosted a Festival of New Music for more than 35 years, featuring significant composers and performers of contemporary music from around the world. The festival enables faculty, students and the community to enjoy ideas and currents in new music.
Contact the College of Music Box Office at 850-645-7949 for tickets to the closing concert. For the full schedule, go to fsufnm.github.io.
Greg Sauer will be the soloist with the FSU Symphony and Wind Orchestra closing concert at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Ruby Diamond Concert Hall.

ON POLITICS; Son of violent radicals is running for D.A. job; San Francisco hopeful says his background has given him insights into justice system.

Texto completo: Chesa Boudin was a model of understatement as he sat across the table inside a high-end Spanish bistro. Dark suit, white shirt, nondescript royal blue tie.
A recent email announcing his candidacy for San Francisco district attorney was similarly understated, referring to the "unique background" he brings to the contest to become the city's chief prosecutor.
The background is this: In 1981, when Boudin was a toddler, his mother dropped him off at the babysitter. Then, with her husband and several others, she helped stick up a Brink's armored car at a suburban mall in upstate New York, a move intended as a revolutionary strike against the hated establishment. A Brink's guard and two police officers were killed in the unsuccessful heist.

Boudin's mother took a plea deal and served 22 years in prison before her release in 2003. His father remains in jail and could stay there the rest of his life. In their absence, Boudin was raised by Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, soldiers, alongside his mom and dad, in the radical Weather Underground.
Boudin refers to the four as "all my parents," which sounds like something from a television sitcom. (Child of violent lefties rebels against his upbringing by putting bad guys behind bars. Hilarity ensues!)
But Boudin was grave and almost preternaturally serious as he discussed how the past should, and should not, apply to the present.
His background, he insists, is incidental to his candidacy. "We stopped determining people's fate based on who their parents are when we ended slavery in this country," he said, his voice assuming a small edge. Later he said, "My parents used violence as a tool for social change and that's not acceptable. Violence is never an acceptable tactic. They committed criminal acts and they've been prosecuted for it."
But growing up as he did, going through a metal detector and steel gates to hug his parents, having their every phone conversations monitored by corrections officers, has given him unique insights, Boudin said, into reforming a criminal justice system he considers broken.
Not because it's cruel and unforgiving but because be believes it's cruel and, given the high rate of recidivism, ineffective.
"It's really the only area of public policy where we insist on doing the most extreme, expensive thing every time, even though we know it doesn't work," said Boudin, 38, who has worked the last four years as a deputy public defender.
The San Francisco district attorney's race, which has drawn several hopefuls, is the most competitive in decades, after incumbent George Gascon announced he would not seek reelection. The front-runner, by most accounts, is Suzy Loftus, a legal counsel in the Sheriff's Department, former president of the police commission and longtime political activist. She enjoys support from the cream of the city's political elite, including Mayor London Breed and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, a former boss.
This being San Francisco, the nonpartisan contest will be fought on the left side of the political margin. But even in a city where permissiveness is an unofficial civic motto, there is growing tension between open-mindedness and frustration with the insults that increasingly make life here a trial: rampant auto break-ins, junkies shooting up in broad daylight, human waste speckling the sidewalks.
"It's hard to find someone who's not been impacted by crime in some way," said Jim Ross, a longtime campaign strategist who is neutral in the district attorney's race. "That could make it tougher to get elected with a less harsh law-and-order message."
Boudin, though, insists his approach would be a smarter, not softer, approach to crime.
He reels off a sheaf of statistics -- no arrest is made in 98% of car burglaries, 85% of those booked in county jail have drug or mental health issues, more than two-thirds of those convicted of a crime commit another offense within three years. Rather than play cat-and-mouse, he said, more should be done to address the underlying causes of crime.
He is not, Boudin said, opposed to locking people away in prison, for as long as need be. "I believe that the role of prosecutor in San Francisco, as in the rest of the country, is to keep his or her constituents safe. How you do that is the nitty-gritty work of developing good policy."
Boudin is no stranger to public notice. In college, he was interviewed by Yale's student newspaper when his mother left prison. A Rhodes scholarship earned him a front-page New York Times profile. He weathered savage book reviews trashing his account of kicking around Latin America. (He worked for a time as a translator in the administration of Venezuela's late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.)
Still, he was guarded, sitting ramrod straight and unsmiling amid the thinning lunch crowd as he discussed the violent family history he fully expects to relive as part of the campaign.
The sins of the past -- albeit not his -- are something he wrestled with during a difficult childhood. There was a learning disability, temper tantrums. "I was angry," Boudin said. "I felt abandoned. I felt guilty about what my parents had done." Those sentiments, he noted, are not uncommon among children of incarcerated parents.
Forgiveness allowed him to move on, he said. In turn, his parents, Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, offered love and encouragement, including support for his candidacy -- though, Boudin said, they worry "about people attacking me unfairly because of things they did."
The election is Nov. 5.
After decades in which it was nearly impossible to be too tough on crime, attitudes are changing.
Activists on the right joined with those on the left to push a criminal justice reform bill, emphasizing leniency, that President Trump signed into law. Cities around the country -- Philadelphia, Chicago, Houston among them -- have elected district attorneys vowing to leaven crime-fighting with a measure of compassion.
Even in San Francisco, Boudin suggested, there's a chance to fight auto break-ins and, at the same time, apply a less punitive, more rationalized approach to criminal justice. It's a rare moment, he said, one that "is bigger than me, or who my parents are."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump expressed optimism Thursday about reaching a landmark trade deal with China, but said in an interview that he would consider leaving in place some tariffs on Chinese goods even if the two sides strike an agreement.
"Without the tariffs, we wouldn't be talking," Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times, shortly after his administration concluded two days of high-level trade talks with Chinese officials. "And I make this point clear to them."
As he hosted the Chinese delegation in the Oval Office earlier in the day, Mr. Trump said he would meet next month with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. He suggested that Mr. Xi was prepared to make significant changes to Beijing's economic policies, including opening its market to American companies and buying more products.
To buttress his point, Mr. Trump had a letter from Mr. Xi -- filled with flattery of Mr. Trump and promises to make big purchases of American agricultural products -- read aloud to reporters. Liu He, China's vice premier and Beijing's trade negotiator, told the president that Mr. Xi was committed to buying five million tons of soybeans, a pledge that caught Mr. Trump's aides by surprise.
"That's a lot of soybeans," Mr. Trump said.
"We never really had a trade deal with China and now we're going to have a great trade deal with China," he said, adding, "if it all works out."
Mr. Trump's chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, struck a far more guarded note, saying the two sides had not even agreed on a draft framework for an agreement that is supposed to come together by March 2. Nor did they discuss rolling back American tariffs on Chinese goods. The main achievement, he suggested, was that the two sides were still talking.
"We did not come off the rails," Mr. Lighthizer said. "That's significant."
A statement from the Chinese delegation said on Thursday that the talks made "important progress," and that the two sides had "candid, specific and fruitful" discussions.
Substantial hurdles remain in the way of a deal before a 90-day trade truce ends, bringing with it higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
While Mr. Trump promoted China's commitment to buy more American goods, he said any agreement he made with Mr. Xi must go far beyond that and include an unprecedented opening of its markets to American businesses. He said a final deal would probably be sealed in person during a meeting next month with Mr. Xi at a location that has not been determined.
"It's a very short period of time for a deal this big. But it's very possible," Mr. Trump said in the interview with The Times. "I believe that a lot of the biggest points are going to be agreed to by me and him."
The United States wants China to commit to buying American goods and services in large quantities to reduce America's trade deficit, and to agree to make structural changes, including ending its practice of requiring American companies to hand over trade secrets as a condition of doing business there.
The surprise Chinese offer to buy soybeans attested to their gamesmanship and attempt to sway Mr. Trump with big numbers. It also left Mr. Lighthizer and his colleague, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, flummoxed during a briefing with reporters about whether the Chinese had pledged to buy five million tons of soybeans, or the more commonly used bushels.
After Mr. Lighthizer dispatched an aide to seek clarification, the White House confirmed that the Chinese offer was to buy five million tons.
An economist at the American Farm Bureau noted that in a normal year the United States exports about 35 million tons of soybeans to China, so the five million ton purchase is not as robust a gesture as Mr. Trump suggested.
The world's two largest economies have been locked in a monthslong standoff that has begun to slow global economic growth and rattled financial markets. Both countries are under increasing pressure to reach an accord: American companies with exposure to China have begun warning that the trade war is hurting profits, and the Chinese economy is growing at its slowest pace in years.
On Wednesday, Mr. Liu and the Chinese delegation began two days of talks with Mr. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump said on Thursday that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer would travel to Beijing in February, after the Chinese New Year holiday, to lay the groundwork for a meeting between the two presidents. One of the biggest issues to resolve, Mr. Lighthizer said, is how to ensure any commitment by the Chinese is enforceable.
"An agreement is nothing without enforcement," Mr. Lighthizer said.
Mr. Liu concurred, stating that it was also important to China that an agreement had mechanisms to ensure that promises were kept.
One issue that has been hanging over the talks is the fate of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that is facing criminal charges in the United States for stealing trade secrets and evading sanctions. Mr. Trump indicated that it did not come up in the talks this week but that "it will be discussed."
"That, actually, as big as it might seem, is very small compared to the overall deal," Mr. Trump said to reporters of the Huawei case.
[Why the trade talks are unlikely to resolve all issues by the deadline.]
Mr. Trump did appear to offer some wiggle room about extending the deadline while continuing negotiations, but he did not appear willing to budge on raising tariffs.
"I think we can do it by March 1," he said. "Can you get it down on paper by March 1? I don't know. I can tell you on March 1 the tariff on China goes to 25 percent."
In a formal statement at the conclusion of the talks, the White House made clear that tariffs will increase if a "satisfactory outcome" is not reached by March 1.
Trade analysts said a potential meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi was a strong sign that an agreement could be within reach, as Mr. Trump has shown a greater inclination to close a deal than Mr. Lighthizer, his hawkish top trade negotiator.
"Trump's apparent willingness to meet with Xi raises the odds of a deal that allows the U.S. to claim at least a partial victory and avoid any further escalation of trade tensions," said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division.
"Both sides seem to want to reach a negotiated settlement," he said, "and for Trump, the political benefits to striking some sort of deal now probably outweigh the benefits of continuing to maintain a tough and inflexible posture against China."
Business groups in the United States have been pleading with the administration to resolve the trade war, which has dented consumer sentiment in both countries and begun to raise prices for Chinese imports. While many American businesses agree that China needs to change its ways, the tit-for-tat tariffs have started to hurt manufacturers and technology companies, including Apple and Caterpillar.
Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who has been briefed on the talks, said China had shown some willingness to make reforms on market access and intellectual property. However, China has been highly reluctant to budge on sensitive subjects such as technology transfer and subsidies of state-owned enterprises. For that reason, there are significant gaps between the two sides.
"I would now say we are at halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations," Mr. Brilliant said. "There is still work to be done."

'Green New Deal,' yet to be defined, has Democrats' support ahead of 2020

Texto completo: Idea puts spotlight on battling climate change, while challenging Trump
The Iowa voter asked Sen. Kamala D. Harris a yes-or-no question.
"Will you fully endorse the Green New Deal tonight?"
The California Democrat, at a CNN town hall, did not answer with a "yes" or a "no."
"I support a Green New Deal," Harris said.
Her careful word choice revealed the complication behind what seems like a straightforward question. At this point, after months of political chatter about it, no actual Green New Deal exists.
A search for the text of Green New Deal legislation won't yield any. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) drafted a proposal for a committee to implement a Green New Deal - as she defined it, a detailed plan for addressing the threat of climate change, economic inequality and spurring job creation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opted for a climate crisis committee instead.
A bill is expected to emerge soon, but its language has not been set, a congressional aide said. Nonetheless, the Green New Deal already has elbowed its way into Democratic dialogue - and, by extension, into a prominent place in 2020 campaign rhetoric. It is a way for Democrats angered at the Trump administration's dismissal of environmental science to demonstrate their desire to attack climate change, with the explicit details left until later.
It is also an idea that divides potential Democratic blocs - appealing to the younger voters the party wants and seen more skeptically by the blue-collar voters the party needs.
Harris and fellow Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) have offered support for the general idea. Former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro identified a Green New Deal as one of his top priorities when he announced his presidential bid last month. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, both possible 2020 candidates, have expressed support. The Sunrise Movement, the group that staged a sit-in outside Pelosi's office in November, is planning protests at Democratic debates to ensure the Green New Deal becomes a major 2020 issue.
The term "Green New Deal" traces its roots to columnist Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times, who dedicated two 2007 pieces to American reliance on foreign oil - which he suggested was as much a national security issue as an environmental one. It recalls President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the widespread financial reforms and economic stimulus effort he instituted in the wake of the Great Depression, efforts that included job creation as a means of improving infrastructure.
The United Nations adopted the term in 2008 and published it in its Green Economy Initiative, a response to the global financial crises striking at that time. Green Party candidate Jill Stein used the Green New Deal as part of her presidential platforms in 2012 and 2016. Ocasio-Cortez considered alternatives to the term throughout her House campaign but decided to stick with it when it continued to generate support on Twitter.
Now, thanks in part to her prominence, the Democratic takeover of the House and growing alarm over climate change, the concept has found new life.
Think tanks and climate advocacy groups have compiled substantial proposals, some more detailed than others. Most proposals agree on one broad idea: a sweeping policy package aimed at decreasing the country's reliance on fossil fuels within a set period and elevating efforts to combat climate change on a wider, more drastic scale. These initial proposals include large-scale investment in clean-energy technology, infrastructure, transportation and research - an effort some advocates have compared to the Manhattan Project or the Apollo program, a massive mobilization of the workforce and U.S. resources.
Beyond escalating the country's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Green New Deal would pair job creation with the kind of social justice efforts that were not a part of FDR's New Deal, which largely benefited white workers, excluding two classes of jobs dominated at the time by nonwhites: agriculture and domestic work. Proponents hope jobs created by the measure could benefit low-income or minority communities.
"I understand [the Green New Deal] to mean we must act with urgency to reduce carbon pollution, to make clean energy a pillar of our economy, to do it in a way that creates jobs and doesn't leave anybody behind," said Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), who chairs the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
Her goal, Castor said, is to turn the general idea into specifics, "to get passed what we can pass immediately in the next year or so, then set the table for more dramatic action come 2020."
Climate change advocates on both sides of the aisle see the emergence of the Green New Deal as a mainstream talking point as a good thing.
"The biggest win is it's on the radar," said Greg Carlock, one of the directors of the liberal think tank Data for Progress, which released its own proposal for a Green New Deal.
"The next win is we have a committee on which we can discuss it . . . We now have a space we didn't have three months ago. It is on the agenda. Presidential candidates are going to be asked if it is on their agenda. That is good."
Rich Powell, executive director of ClearPath, a conservative clean-energy think tank, agreed.
"We are definitely supportive of having a higher ambition when it comes to policies that advance clean energy to solve climate change," Powell said. "Having a higher ambition than where we are is good, and it's good that it's injected that into the discourse. But now, we have to get really careful about how we proceed."
A December poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University revealed that 81 percent of Americans support a measure that would "accelerate the transition" to clean energy, while upgrading infrastructure and providing job training. The results indicated bipartisan support, although Democratic backing was more emphatic.
Liberals see a Green New Deal proceeding in two parts, with minor pieces of bipartisan legislation pushed during the Trump administration, followed by a bigger package if Democrats seize the White House in 2020.
"How could you [get it passed before 2020]?" said Ocasio-Cortez's communications director, Corbin Trent. "I think we need to get this thing fixed up before we get it passed. Now we have to spend some time fleshing it out."
Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) are working on a measure, his spokeswoman Giselle Barry said. The details and timing are not final, she said, "but it will be soon."
The largest renewable-energy and energy-efficiency package in U.S. history was not passed as pure climate legislation, but rather as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. While the more traditional aspects of the stimulus, like job creation efforts, garnered the most attention, the package committed more than $27 billion to renewable energy technologies and research.
Major climate legislation has, at times, been a difficult sell. In 2009, with Democrats holding the White House and both houses of Congress, an environmentally focused bill - the American Clean Energy and Security Act - passed the House but did not earn a vote in the Senate. Less substantial legislation, however, seems better positioned to garner bipartisan support.
"Just getting green-energy and climate change legislation done has been hard enough," Powell said. "It doesn't get any easier if we attach all of this other, frankly very contentious social stuff to it."
But that "very contentious social stuff" is a key part of the Green New Deal idea - particularly when it comes to economic inequality. For example, in Ocasio-Cortez's proposal, she suggested any legislation include ambitious liberal policies: a job-guarantee program, basic-income programs and universal health care.
Even without a detailed plan, Ocasio-Cortez has established a far-left baseline of what a Green New Deal might look like and shifted the conversation for presidential hopefuls who saw the enthusiasm her initial efforts generated. Like Harris, those hopefuls are being asked about the idea and discussing it.
"The debate we're starting to see is between ideas on the left and ideas on the further left," said Carlock, who said he believes that dialogue could pull Republicans to more centrist ideas such as money for research and development or a carbon tax.
Even if Democrats were to win unified control of Washington in 2020, passage of a full-throated Green New Deal package could be problematic because it would require massive government investment at a time of spiraling deficits. It also would affect jobs in politically critical areas such as the Midwest, risking backlash among Democratic members and voters.

Paul Klee: Like father, like son: Michael Malone's championship dad reflects on Jordan, Harden, rise of Nuggets

Texto completo: DENVER • Michael Malone, the point guard, was scrappy, relentless, smart, the ol’ ball coach says. Good passer. Preferred ‘D’ to ‘O.’ Related as well with the big-bucks star as he did with the kid swimming in khakis, mopping up sweat.
When they were on the Knicks staff together, the coach says, Michael Malone would snag a ball and scrimmage with the players. (“That stuff matters,” Steph Curry said during a recent visit to Pepsi Center.) A longtime team photographer once told the coach that Michael Malone competed like Dick McGuire, a Knicks great and Hall of Famer.
“Now when I watch Michael coach,” he says, “I get so nervous watching our games.”
The ol’ ball coach is Brendan Malone, the father of Nuggets coach Michael Malone. Fifty years he spent in basketball, 30 as an NBA assistant. He won a pair of championship rings with the Pistons. He’s now 76 and forever Astoria, Queens, through and through. “They say I’m old-school,” Brendan Malone says, enough so that he reads the print edition of the New York Times every morning.
Brendan Malone lives in Westchester County, New York, and rarely misses a Nuggets game on NBA League Pass. Dad’s pretty proud of his son, the Nuggets coach, you might say. He hollered at the TV like the rest of us during a 25-point comeback at Memphis on Tuesday (“Herculean,” Malone said Thursday, “But why wait until the second half?”) and has witnessed most of Denver’s 35-15 start, a franchise record through 50 games and the dawn of a new era.
“We’re surprising everybody,” Brendan Malone said. “Everybody’s waiting for us to fall. So now we’re disappointing everybody.”
Just as president of basketball operations Tim Connelly should be the front-runner for NBA Executive of the Year, Michael Malone should be the top candidate for Coach of the Year. His resume shows not only the No. 2 spot in the West, but a seemingly impossible road to get there, with the league’s third-youngest roster burdened with the third-most man-games lost due to injury, according to mangameslost.com.
But dad’s not going to disagree with his son’s candidacy, so that’s not why we spoke Thursday. We spoke because the Nuggets on Friday host James Harden and the Rockets, one of the few puzzles they haven’t yet figured out.
“Nobody has figured him out,” as Brendan Malone said.
And it was Brendan Malone, then a Detroit assistant, who designed the “Jordan rules” defense employed by the Pistons in their timeless battle against Michael and the Bulls in the ‘80s and ‘90s. That seems helpful. While this is not to say Harden equals Jordan, principles of slowing a one-man wrecking crew still hold true.
Here, let’s all geek out while the coach charged with stopping the G.O.A.T. breaks it down: “With Jordan he was playing all over the place — on the wing, up on top, in the post. The ‘Jordan Rules’ we came up with, when he was on the wing, we would push him to the elbow and double team at the elbow. We did not want him to drive baseline. When he posted up, we doubled from the top. Joe Dumars did a good job. He was strong enough. We didn’t stop him, but we contained him. When we kept him under 30 points that was an accomplishment. You don’t want Harden scoring 60 like he did against the Knicks. Then you don’t have a chance.”
And on Harden, who enraged opposing fans, emboldened referees and averaged 43 points in the month of January: “With Harden it’s all pick-and-roll. (Mike) D’Antoni has a high pick-and-roll and spreads out his 3-point shooters. I thought the best job was the last game against the Pelicans (when Harden had 37 points on 11-for-32 shooting). They did a good job giving him different looks. It’s exactly how I would attack him. You gotta to give him different looks.
“Pick him up above the 3-point line, play him off his left shoulder, force him to drive the ball. The back line of defense has to protect the basket. Sometimes you double-team him, sometimes you play him straight up. That’s what the Pelicans did. And you absolutely cannot bring your hands down. Soon as you bring your hands down, he’s shooting free throws.”
Sounds easy enough, right? The worst-case playoffs scenario has the Nuggets facing Harden’s Rockets in an early series. The best-case scenario has the Nuggets continuing to assume the personality of Michael Malone, their coach — scrappy, relentless, smart.
As the Nuggets prepare to integrate point guard Isaiah Thomas into a backcourt that seems to grow another Monte Morris or Malik Beasley with every game, Malone’s greatest strength as a coach comes into focus: player psychology.
It’s not every day DeMarcus Cousins delays the team bus because he wants to pick the opposing coach’s brain after a game, or Thomas signs with Denver due to his relationship with the coach. Theirs are strong personalities who, for unique reasons, bond with Michael Malone’s.
“I was just talking to my wife about Latrell Sprewell. It was a little like Cousins when I was there,” Brendan Malone says. “You have to talk to them with respect. They’re adults, fathers, husbands. Some coaches come into the league and try to coach them like high school players. But players have to feel that you have their back (and) you’re going to stick up for them.”
Michael Malone is not bashful in appraising the potential of these Nuggets. He’s told The Gazette this is the core, paced by first-time All-Star Nikola Jokic, capable of one day carrying the first NBA title to Colorado.
On that note, his father is quick to remind the Pistons’ parades weren’t planned overnight.
“Let me tell you about the Pistons,” Brendan Malone said. “They drafted Isiah Thomas No. 2 in the draft. They got Adrian Dantley. Then they got Dumars, John Salley and Dennis Rodman in the draft. Then they pulled a trade for (Bill) Laimbeer and James Edwards.
“It was a process. It took from 1980 to 1989. You had to go through Atlanta, Boston and the Lakers before we could win a championship. It’s a process. People, they get impatient with the process. They want it now . This young Nuggets team, they’re maturing, they’re going to make mistakes. Stick with ‘em. He loves them. Loves his players, loves the city. He just loves it.”
One basketball lifer lived a golden era as an NBA coach, one is beginning his own. Like father, like son.

Texto completo: Feder: Jim DeRogatis to write the book on R. Kelly Veteran Chicago music critic and "Sound Opinions" co-host Jim DeRogatis is the subject of a glowing profile in The New York Times, which credits him for his heroic reporting of alleged sexual misconduct by R&B star R. Kelly over the past two decades, Robert Feder writes.
The New York Times also reports that DeRogatis has signed with Abrams Press to publish Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly this fall. In the book DeRogatis will chronicle his reporting of the case and "delve into some of the topics that have consumed him as a critic, like the insidious power of celebrity media."

Texto completo: Gadgets like Apple's iPhone have become so powerful and durable that you can wait many years before buying a new one. The bad news is that your next upgrade will probably cost a lot more.
Consider that last year, Apple raised prices for most of its products. They included its iPhones, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, MacBook Air and iPad Pro. (Yes, that is nearly the company's entire gadget lineup.) Apple has said the increases were necessary because the products had become more complex and expensive to make.
Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, defended the iPhone's rising prices in an interview with "Good Morning America" in September. He said the iPhone was an all-in-one gadget replacing cameras and music players, among other gizmos.
"We found that people want to have the most innovative product available, and with that, it's not cheap to do that," he said.
That justification did not add up for me. Since the iPhone's debut in 2007, it had been a multifunctional device that continually incorporated cutting-edge features without significant price increases. The same went for Apple's watches, computers and tablets: They became more advanced over the years without big price jumps -- until now.
And there is a question of whether Apple has pushed prices up too high. On Tuesday, the company -- while dealing with reports about an embarrassing privacy glitch that let iPhone users eavesdrop on one another's microphones -- reported disappointing financial results. In a letter warning investors before the quarterly earnings report, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales may have slowed because of factors including higher prices.
For a reality check on Apple's pricing, I spoke to financial experts and pricing strategists. I learned that there is credence to Apple's arguments: Its products do cost more to produce than in years past. But that didn't stop me from consulting with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products and tracks deals, for advice on how we could shave the costs of our next Apple upgrades.
Here's what I found.
How and why Apple raised prices
Last year, Apple's prices shot up by 7 percent to 60 percent, depending on the product. Perhaps the most notable increase was for the new Mac Mini, which costs about $800, up from $500. (The last Mac Mini debuted in 2014.)
Some Apple prices stayed firm or declined. Notably, the newer entry-level iPad is selling for about $330, down from $500 in years past.
But in general, prices jumped. That was surprising given that product costs typically fall as technologies mature and parts become widely available, which was what happened with televisions.
The more I examined the pricing, though, the more evidence there was that the latest Apple products are more expensive to make. Apple also appears to be under pressure to introduce more complex innovations to compete in the brutal technology market.
Take a look at the company's gross profit margin, or the money it makes from products after the cost to make and sell them is factored in. If Apple's gross margins are lower today even though prices are higher, that indicates the products cost more to make.
And that is indeed the case. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who has studied Apple for years, estimated that the company's gross margins for the iPhone were below 40 percent, down from more than 50 percent several years ago.
Mr. Sacconaghi said the shrinking margins demonstrated how tough it had become to compete in the technology market. Apple has had to add features like stronger metals, sophisticated cameras, high-resolution displays, advanced chips and faster wireless connectivity while trimming back on some profit given that rival products from the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo have become very capable. If Apple had wanted to keep profit margins consistent with past years, he said, it would have had to raise prices even higher and risk losing sales.
"You have to put in more to stay competitive, or you're going to lose share," he said.
Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said Apple was still in a unique position to introduce broad price increases. Other companies, such as grocery brands, lack the clout to do so because their competitors might undercut them and lure away customers.
"They're in the very enviable position that they can, by and large, take major action across the board without, so far, seeing a major erosion of loyalty as a result," Mr. Wiesel said.
An Apple spokeswoman referred to Mr. Cook's comments on Tuesday's earnings call. In response to a question about whether Apple had raised prices too high, Mr. Cook said the prices were not that much more. He noted that the iPhone XS was the same price as last year's iPhone X, and that the XR was priced only slightly higher than the iPhone 8.
How to save on Apple gear
Discounts for new Apple products are rare. But here are several methods to lower the cost of your next purchase.
Trade in your old device
One simple way to get some cash toward your next purchase is to take your old devices to a trade-in program at a retailer or a wireless store. Apple runs Apple GiveBack, which gives you Apple Store credit in exchange for an old phone, tablet, computer or smart watch. Gazelle, an online reseller, will let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs in exchange for cash or Amazon store credit. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless offer trade-in programs. And Best Buy stores also provide store credit for many used devices.
Buy last year's model
The best part about the release of a new Apple product is that last year's model can be had for cheaper. Apple now sells the iPhone 8, still a very good phone, for about $600, down from its original $700 price.
Wait for sales
Older-generation Apple Watches and tablets occasionally go on sale during holiday shopping periods such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Wirecutter said. In November, the Apple Watch Series 3 dropped to $200 on Amazon, down from the original $330.
To scout for deals, you can create alerts for price drops using web tools like Camel Camel Camel. Wirecutter also runs a webpage that regularly highlights deals.
Apple product discounts tend to be better when you buy through third parties like Best Buy and Amazon.
"The best tip is to shop around before going to the Apple Store," said Alex Roth, a commerce editor for Wirecutter.
Buy used or refurbished gadgets
Trusted brands like Apple, Best Buy and Amazon offer programs to buy refurbished or used products.
Refurbished products typically were returned by a consumer and then restored to excellent condition, and they often include a fresh battery and warranty. Apple's online store for refurbished products lists last year's iPad Pro for about $550, down from about $650.
Buying used Apple gadgets can often yield more savings, but you will have to be judicious about whom you buy from. Your best bet is to buy from a friend, a relative or a reseller that is a trusted brand. I have had consistently good experiences buying used products from Amazon's Warehouse program, for example.
Skip the upgrade altogether
Of course, you can save $750 on the next $750 iPhone by not buying it at all. The most thrifty thing you can do is to maintain your device and skip upgrading.
Plenty of Apple customers have caught on to this approach. The company acknowledged in its recent note to investors that many iPhone customers took advantage of its battery replacement program, which may have contributed to slower sales of replacements.
There's a hidden benefit to giving your devices some tender loving care.
"Take good care of the one you have so that when the time comes for an upgrade, you can trade that one in and you'll get something for it," Mr. Roth said.

Texto completo: When New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s former chief of staff was quietly forced to resign in early 2018, it wasn’t the first time he lost his job over allegations of sexual harassment.

Less than a month before he was hired by de Blasio, Kevin O’Brien had been fired from his job as a senior adviser to the Democratic Governors Association in Washington, the New York Times reported.

O’Brien had worked as a representative for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, at the organization and had served for him in other capacities since 2009.

He was fired in December 2015 after a woman employed at the association accused him of sexually harassing her. An investigation into the matter supported her claims.

Eric Phillips, a spokesperson for de Blasio, told the New York Times the mayor was unaware of the previous firing and a background check had turned up “no adverse information.”

Bullock, however, had been aware of the complaint against O’Brien and “fully agreed with the decision to end his employment,” he said in a statement. Yet, he did not warn de Blasio’s office of the alleged harassment, despite meeting with the mayor and O’Brien at least once.

“It’s clear that was not enough to protect these women from what has proven to be an unacceptable pattern of behavior on his part. We all have a responsibility to do better and to put an end to sexual harassment, and I’m committed to doing my part,” Bullock said in a statement.

O’Brien has blamed alcohol abuse for his “horrible decisions.”

Jill Abramson paints a cloudy future for journalism and democracy

Texto completo: It's easy to imagine how Jill Abramson's new book might have turned out differently. In “Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," the veteran journalist follows the fortunes of four media organizations. BuzzFeed and Vice are young, energetic, willing to break rules and try new things. The New York Times and The Washington Post are stodgy, sclerotic giants trying to grope their way toward a digital future. We all know how that's going to turn out. Right?
Well, something unexpected happened on the way to the old-media boneyard. Within the past couple of years BuzzFeed and Vice, which had made strides toward becoming major players, fell short of revenue projections and had to cut back on their ambitions. This was owing partly to hubris, partly because Google and Facebook were hoovering up every digital advertising dollar in sight.
Meanwhile the Times and the Post — the latter supercharged by its mega-wealthy owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — moved toward economic viability by rethinking coverage and convincing a generation of readers brought up on free online content that quality news was worth paying for, particularly in the age of Trump.
Abramson, a former executive editor of the Times who now teaches at Harvard, has written a big, ambitious chronicle of the past decade. Her method involves a series of revolving chapters that examine the ups and downs of each organization in turn, as well as a chapter on Facebook. (Disclosure: In her bibliography Abramson cites two of my books and an academic paper I wrote.)
Some have criticized Abramson for favoring the legacy newspapers over the digital start-ups. There may be something to that. She goes into great detail about BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti's research-driven pursuit of clicks and viral content and about Vice's culture of alcohol, drugs, and sexual harassment. Vice founder Shane Smith comes off as a shambling egomaniac, although later in the book he is depicted as trying to clean up his act.
But those sections strike me as warranted and fair. After all, BuzzFeed was built on a foundation of cat videos and listicles, and Vice's chaotic, testosterone-fueled internal culture is surely relevant. Besides, Abramson is generous in acknowledging the importance of their best journalism, including Craig Silverman's groundbreaking work for BuzzFeed on fake news and Elle Reeve's mini-documentary for Vice about the deadly neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville, Va.
The chapters on the Times and the Post cover ground that will be familiar to many media observers. Abramson traces the Post's decline during the last few years of Graham family stewardship and its revival under Bezos. The Times's journey was more harrowing — bailed out by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, forced to sell its gleaming new headquarters, and casting off its non-Times properties, including The Boston Globe. Abramson criticizes both newspapers for smudging the line that had traditionally separated news from business operations, a line that she observes doesn't even exist at BuzzFeed or Vice. Mostly, though, she praises the Times's and the Post's reinvention efforts.
In the most awkward section of the book, Abramson deals with her 2014 firing as executive editor of the Times. She uses the occasion to do some score-settling against the then-publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and her successor, Dean Baquet. But her account strikes me as fundamentally honest and reflective, as she blames her demise on a combination of sexism and her own shortcomings as a manager.
“Merchants of Truth" spawned controversy even before the book was published.
First, Howard Kurtz of Fox News reported that Abramson had criticized the Times for liberal bias. And yes, Abramson writes, “Given its mostly liberal audience, there was an implicit financial reward for the Times in running lots of Trump stories, almost all of them negative." But it's not quite that simple. For instance, she lauds both the Times's and the Post's tough coverage of the Trump administration, reserving especially fulsome praise for her former employer: “The depth and intensity of the coverage was masterful. On most days it outshone the Post's. The news report as a whole had never been stronger." By leaving out that context, Kurtz created a misleading impression.
More problematic were revelations of errors in the uncorrected galleys. Vice reporter Arielle Duhaime-Ross complained that Abramson had made multiple mistakes about her, including her gender identity. Danny Gold of the “PBS NewsHour" tweeted that Abramson's description of his past reporting for Vice about Ebola in Liberia included “a straight up lie." Errors in galleys are common, but they generally involve typos and spelling mistakes. And not all of the problems were addressed in the final version of the book.
Inaccuracies notwithstanding, “Merchants of Truth" is a valuable and insightful survey. It ends on an optimistic note, with one caveat: Abramson acknowledges that the relative good fortune of the four media organizations she profiles stands in contrast to the implosion of journalism at the local level. The media scene Abramson describes remains in turmoil. Witness the deep cuts at BuzzFeed that took place late last month. Whether journalism will outlive the wobbling vessels in which it is carried remains a fundamental question for the future of democracy.

Ugly trend of demonizing white men

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh’s December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights — with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas — the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men’s anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC’s "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men — old, by the way — are not protecting women. They’re protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y’all, for everyone. We’re all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What’s wrong with them?"
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he’d be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat — for now.

Texto completo: Howard Schultz's book launch — and potential presidential bid — is off to a rough start.
Just one day after announcing that he was preparing to run for president as a third-party candidate, the former Starbucks CEO kicked off a nationwide tour Monday evening to promote his new book. He had barely begun to speak at a Barnes & Noble in New York when a protester interrupted.
"Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire!" the unidentified bearded man yelled, adding an expletive. "Go back to being ratioed on Twitter!"
The brief disruption summed up the animosity and outright hostility that Schultz has faced since Sunday, when he told CBS's "60 Minutes" that he was seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent.
"Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world," the man at the book launch shouted as private security guards hustled him out of the room and a handful of audience members booed.
A few minutes later, a second heckler spoke up, HuffPost reported.
"Health care is a human right!" the man chanted repeatedly, in apparent reference to Schultz's claim from the "60 Minutes" interview that "the country cannot afford" to provide free health care for all. He, too, was removed from the event.
The interruptions to Schultz's first book tour event followed two days of negative backlash online and in print. As The Washington Post's Michael Scherer reported, Schultz's announcement on Sunday was met with immediate blowback from Democrats. High-profile liberals, including the singer Cher, threatened to never set foot in a Starbucks again. (Schultz no longer runs the company, but remains one of its largest shareholders.)
"Vanity projects that help destroy democracy are disgusting," tweeted Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. "If he enters the race, I will start a Starbucks boycott because I'm not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win."
Washington Post
Ga. gubernatorial candidate to respond to Trump speech
WASHINGTON — Stacey Abrams, a rising star from Georgia who narrowly lost a race for governor there last year, will deliver the Democrats' official response to President Trump's State of the Union address next week.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday that he invited Abrams to make the televised response weeks ago. She publicly agreed to the often-thankless task on Tuesday.
“She is just a great spokesperson," Schumer told reporters. “She's an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else."
The designation provides Abrams, 45, with a nationally televised platform to burnish her profile at a time when she is said to be considering her next political steps, including a possible run for Senate in 2020 against Senator David Perdue, a Georgia Republican. But it also carries substantial risks: A notoriously awkward format, State of the Union responses have been more memorable in recent years for the memes they have produced than persuasive oratory.

'Trump is having an impact': NATO head credits president's tough talk for $100B boost

Texto completo: President Donald Trump "is committed to NATO" and deserves credit in obtaining $100 billion more in defense spending for the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said Sunday.
"President Trump has been very clear: He is committed to NATO. He stated that clearly just a few days ago and also at the NATO summit in July," Stoltenberg said on "Fox News Sunday. "
Stoltenberg's comment stands in contrast to Democrats who fear Trump wants to pull out of NATO, and some who have expressed concern he could be undermining the military alliance because it benefits Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A New York Times report earlier this month said Trump repeatedly told aides he wanted to pull out of the alliance. In response to the report, Democrats pushed for legislation requiring congressional approval of any move to leave NATO.
Trump has also been criticized for his aggressive approach in insisting America's "delinquent" allies pay a greater share toward the collective defense agreement. At the summit in July, he demanded the other members "immediately" increase their contributions.
Stoltenberg said the tough approach paid off.
"We agreed to do more to step up – and now we see the results. By the end of next year, NATO allies will add $100 billion extra toward defense," he said. "So we see some real money and some real results. And we see that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact. "
The president took note of Stoltenberg's interview.
"Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline," Trump tweeted. "It’s called burden sharing. Also, more united. "
The president also said Stoltenberg's interview undermined the narrative from "Dems & Fake News" who "like to portray the opposite" of his relationship with NATO.
When asked if he was concerned that Trump was "helping Putin splinter NATO," Stoltenberg said, "What I see is that actually NATO is united because we are able to adapt to deliver. North America and Europe are doing more together now than before. "
Stoltenberg said Trump is helping "us adapt the alliance, which we need, because we live in a more unpredictable world. "
"And you have to remember that the increase we now see in defense spending by European and NATO allies comes after years of decline. So before they were cutting billions. Now they're actually adding billions," he said.

Texto completo: "Let me tell you how it all started," Ron Stallworth told a crowd of more than 700 people in Iowa City's Englert Theatre on Wednesday night.
What unfolded that night was Stallworth, a retired black officer of the Colorado Springs Police Department, telling the unbelievable story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan in the 1970s, how he stopped cross burnings and how he was close to becoming a local leader for the white supremacist group.
"This sounds like a movie, doesn't it?" Stallworth asked as he stood on the Englert stage just a day after the movie "BlackKKlansman," based off his memoir, received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie was directed by trailblazing filmmaker Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Stallworth and Adam Driver as his partner in the investigation.
"I bet you thought you'd get John David Washington up here. But you got me," Stallworth said.
Stallworth's lecture was a part of the University of Iowa Lecture Committee's spring lineup of speakers. With an audience filled with students, locals and many more, Stallworth illustrated the connections between the hate and racism he confronted as a an undercover cop in the 1970s and what he sees today.
The former cop was direct when asked by an audience member about how to combat white supremacy today.
"You vote that idiot out of the White House," he said , referring to President Donald Trump.
"You vote that idiot congressman out of Congress, Iowa," he added about Iowa 4th District Rep. Steve King, who recently told the New York Times "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
"Why has it just become an issue for those good people who voted for him now? He's been saying these things for years, unless those people actually believe what he says," Stallworth said.
Before he took questions from the audience, Stallworth spent the majority of the lecture explaining the wild but true story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan as an undercover cop.
It started in 1978 when Stallworth was hired as the first black officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department. As an undercover officer, he was looking through the newspaper to see if there was anything of interest. He saw a recruitment ad for the KKK in town. He sent them a letter and absentmindedly used his real name, "not one of my two undercover names. I had a brain cramp that day," Stallworth said.
The next week he got a call from the KKK asking why he wanted to join. After he spewed a series of racial slurs aimed at black people, they asked him to meet the current KKK members.
"Obviously, because God blessed me with this beautiful ebony skin, I couldn't meet them," Stallworth said to a round of thunderous applause from the crowd. What he did was recruit a white officer that would be his white avatar and pose as him in face-to-face meetings.
He had to get approval from leadership first. A sergeant initially denied the request because, as Stallworth said, he thought the white officer didn't "sound like a black guy."
"I asked him what does a black guy sound like," Stallworth said, and the sergeant answered with silence. Other officers at the department told him that the white officer wouldn't be "shuckin' and jivin'" like a black person would.
Stallworth was coming face-to-face with racism within his own department, so he took the matter up with the chief himself.
"When you see that you're out to do something you know is right, that it's the right path, do it. Don't even let authority stop you," Stallworth said.
The chief gave him approval, and a white officer to pose as him, and the investigation was underway. For seven-and-a-half months, Stallworth would have full conversations over the phone with everyone from local KKK members to David Duke, then the Grand Wizard, the preeminent leader of the KKK.
"If he was up here instead of me, I guarantee you'd like him," Stallworth said, calling Duke slick, smart and nice. "Until he started talking about race."
Though Stallworth called them "not the brightest bulbs in the shed," what they discovered was alarming. The KKK had plans to bomb the town's two gay bars. Its membership was made up of a few soldiers from nearby Fort Carson, so they had the means to do such a thing.
One day, he was summoned by the FBI to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base, an installation literally built under a mountain in Colorado. High ranking officials looked at his investigation and discovered two KKK members were higher-ups at North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, and that they had top security positions. Stallworth was told later that day the two men were removed from their positions in Colorado and sent to work at a base near the North Pole.
The investigation was shut down by the chief of police when the KKK members asked Stallworth to be their chapter leader. The chief told him to destroy all the documents about the investigation, but Stallworth ignored his command and kept the files. In 2014, after he retired, he wrote the memoir about his interactions with the KKK.
After the lecture, Stallworth took questions from the audience. One attendee asked about the movie. He detailed young screenwriters Charlie Wachtel ad David Rabinowitz calling him out of the blue to ask if anyone was making his memoir into the movie. He gave them approval to do so, but he had control over what would be in the script. Five drafts later, the script was finished. Soon, Lee would come on-board to give the movie the director's infamous political flair.
"These [writers,] hopefully in February, will win their first Academy Award," Stallworth said.
Stallworth saved possibly the the most unbelievable moment of his investigation, and one of the craziest moments in the movie, for near the end of his event.
When Duke himself visited town, Stallworth was picked to be Duke's bodyguard since the Grand Wizard had received death threats. Though he was worried that Duke may recognize his voice, the chief said no one else was available.
So he did his job, shook hands with Duke and protected him throughout his visit to town.
The day came to a crescendo when the cop asked for a photo with Duke and the Colorado leader of the KKK. They agreed, so Stallworth handed a camera to the undercover cop posing as a KKK member. Right before the photo was snapped, Stallworth put his arms around both white supremacists.
Duke was furious, and demanded the photo be destroyed. Stallworth told him if the Grand Wizard touched him, he'd be arrested for assaulting a police officer. Duke sulked away and started spouting his white supremacist rhetoric.
"I was David Duke's worst nightmare," Stallworth said to the crowd. "I was a n----- with a badge and a gun and I have the authority to kick his ass." The crowd cheered wildly and the Black Klansman himself smiled.

Texto completo: The Trump administration insists that tough sanctions will stay in place until North Korea completely gives up its nuclear arsenal. North Korean officials insist on sanctions relief early in the process.
President Trump remains bullish that the North Korea nuclear threat can be contained. Speaking to reporters last Saturday, the president praised the "incredible meeting" he had the day before with a top representative of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, trumpeting the "tremendous progress" the two sides had made.
The optimistic view is that the White House meeting with Kim Yong-chol, a former North Korean intelligence chief and now his government's lead nuclear negotiator, was indeed productive, and Mr. Trump is on his way to resolving one of the world's most complex and dangerous nuclear weapons problems.
But a path to that outcome isn't yet visible to the outside world. North Korea has forgone nuclear tests, missile tests and rhetorical attacks for more than 400 days. That's an important development. At the same time, however, it continues to produce nuclear fuel, weapons and missiles. So, as the two leaders prepare for their second summit (reportedly next month in Vietnam), the pressure is on the Trump administration to articulate a realistic strategy for achieving a mutually agreed upon outcome.
No such strategy was evident last June when Mr. Trump broke with decades of foreign policy precedent by meeting directly with Mr. Kim in Singapore, in the first summit between American and North Korean leaders. Mr. Trump deserves credit for opening up this dialogue, but it has, so far, yielded few tangible results.
The one concrete product of the Singapore meeting, a concluding statement, was so poorly drafted that it laid the groundwork for months of stalemate. It committed the two leaders to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," without even defining "denuclearization," let alone explicitly agreeing on the sequence of actions to be taken.
Publicly, the two sides still hew to staunch positions: The Trump administration insists that tough sanctions will stay in place until North Korea completely gives up its nuclear arsenal. North Korean officials insist on sanctions relief early in the process.
But small signs of movement led to plans for the second summit. Mr. Trump backed off his insistence on immediate disarmament, and his administration recently eased travel restrictions so American aid workers and humanitarian supplies could once again enter the impoverished country.
Even if complete denuclearization is not possible, negotiators should at least seek a permanent end to testing and the production of fissile material.

Vaccine hesitancy must be overcome for public health

Texto completo: The World Health Organization has ranked vaccine hesitancy — the growing resistance to widely available lifesaving vaccines — as one of the top 10 health threats in the world for 2019.
That news will not come as a surprise in New York City, where the worst measles outbreak in decades is now underway. Nor in California or Minnesota, where similar outbreaks unfolded in 2014 and 2017, respectively. Nor in Texas, where some 60,000 children remain wholly unvaccinated thanks in part to an aggressive anti-vaccine lobby.
Leading global health threats typically are caused by the plagues and perils of low-income countries — but vaccine hesitancy is as American as can be. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of children who are unvaccinated has quadrupled since 2001, even though the overall utilization of most vaccines remains high. More than 100,000 American infants and toddlers have received no vaccines whatsoever, and millions more have received only some crucial shots.
The consequences of this disparity are substantial: a surge in outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis and other diseases; an increase in influenza deaths; and dismal rates of HPV vaccination, which doctors say could effectively wipe out cervical cancer if it were better utilized. But infectious disease experts warn that things could get much worse. Trust in vaccines is being so thoroughly eroded, they say, that these prevention tools are in danger of becoming useless. The next major disease outbreak "will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies," Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, writes in the journal Nature, but to an "emotional contagion, digitally enabled."
Thwarting this danger will require a campaign as bold and aggressive as the one being waged by the anti-vaccination contingent. Here's how to get started.
Get tough. After the 2014 California measles outbreak, the state eliminated nonmedical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations. After a similar outbreak in Michigan, health officials there began requiring individuals to formally consult with their local health departments before opting out of otherwise-mandatory shots. In both cases, these tougher policies drove up vaccination rates. Other states ought to follow this lead, and the federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.
Be savvy. The Vaccine Confidence Project is a London-based academic endeavor that monitors anti-vaccine websites for rumors and conspiracies and addresses them before the messages go viral. It also conducts regular surveys of attitudes and puts out a vaccine confidence index. Federal health officials would do well to implement a similar program, make it as public as possible and pair it with an aggressive and targeted social media campaign that makes as much use of celebrities as the anti-vaccine movement has.
Be clear. Vaccines, to some extent, are victims of their own success. In the United States especially, they've beaten so many infectious foes into oblivion that hardly any practicing doctors, let alone new parents, remember how terrible those diseases once were. An effective pro-vaccine campaign needs to remind us: Vaccines prevent two million to three million deaths globally each year.
Know the enemy. Instead of ignoring anti-vaccination arguments, an effective pro-vaccine campaign would confront them directly, over and over, for as long as it takes. Yes, there are chemicals in vaccines, but they are not toxic. No, vaccines can't overwhelm your immune system, which already confronts countless pathogens every day.
Enlist the right support. Some doctors and scientists have referred to "uneventful vaccination" as "The Greatest Story Never Told." Though they may not spread on the internet like the stories of terrible mishaps that anti-vaxxers traffic in, these far more common tales of inoculation without incident can be a powerful elixir for a nervous new parent. The best ambassadors of these stories are likely to be parents themselves. If health officials corralled these families and trained them in the basics of vaccine science, they might succeed where official voices sometimes fail.

Texto completo: For eight years, it seemed to Margarita Cruz that the management at the Trump Organization's golf club in Westchester, N.Y., did not notice -- or did not care -- that the green card and Social Security card she had used to get hired were fake, purchased in Queens for about $ 120.
Ms. Cruz, a housekeeper, said she cleaned guest rooms, offices and shops at the club. She laundered sheets and pool towels. But that all ended this month, she said.
Ms. Cruz and about a dozen other employees -- housekeepers, landscapers and a head chef -- at the club, Trump National Golf Club, were fired Jan. 18 because they were in the country illegally, according to interviews with Ms. Cruz and the former workers' lawyer.
The firings were first reported on Saturday by The Washington Post.
The New York Times reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed at another club owned by the Trump Organization, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though management there had some knowledge of their fraudulent papers.
Several workers deemed ineligible to work in the country had already been fired at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
The employment of undocumented workers at Trump Organization properties runs counter to President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, which he has made central to his campaign and his presidency. He is currently in a heated political battle to build a wall along the border with Mexico, which he claims would stop drugs and crime. Evidence does not support Mr. Trump's thesis.
There is nothing to indicate that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew about the workers' immigration status at either golf club. But Ms. Cruz, 44, said she believed that management at the Westchester club knew about her immigration status before January.
Her papers were requested again two years ago, she said, not just when she was hired. Anibal Romero, who represents Ms. Cruz and 14 other former workers at the golf club, the majority of whom were fired Jan. 18, was stronger in his wording.
"I'm not buying that they didn't know," Mr. Romero said.
Neither Ms. Cruz nor the other former workers received benefits like health insurance or a pension, as other golf club employees did, Mr. Romero said. Most of his clients came into the country through Mexico, Mr. Romero said, and were originally from countries such as Mexico, Ecuador and Honduras.
"This was a two-tiered system," he said. "The people who were legal and the people who are undocumented."
He said the workers were fired by being individually called into a room by an executive, who read their names off a list.
The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization on Saturday. The Trump Organization and the Westchester golf club did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to The Post, Eric Trump, who manages the Trump Organization with his brother Donald Jr., said: "We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately."
Ms. Cruz entered the United States in 2009 near Piedras Negras, Mexico, on the Texas border, she said, with a 12-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son. Her parents had paid a coyote $ 11,000 for the trip.
She said that in Mexico she earned about $ 40 a week working at a restaurant. She started at $ 11 per hour at the golf club, and then got a raise to $ 14 per hour. She said she did not have any savings when she was fired because she had been paying back her parents.
Mr. Trump's political rhetoric has been surprising, she said, because he would regularly come by the golf club before his election and give the workers $ 50 tips in cash.
"He would come over and say hello, ask your name and how long you had worked at the club," Ms. Cruz said. "He would ask you how you liked the rug, or a picture on the wall, things like that."
She added, "If he really did hate Latinos so much, why did he come over to talk to us?"
She said some of her colleagues had worked at the golf club for 18 years.
"I couldn't understand why he started talking like that about Latinos now and why he fired us," she said.
Mr. Romero said he is seeking federal and state investigations of the golf club to see if it had been exploiting the undocumented workers.

Local newspapers were already gutted. What's left to cut?

Texto completo: The news desert in Tennessee typifies an American crisis, says journalist
Wednesday was a bloodbath for journalists. BuzzFeed said it would lay off 15 percent of its employees, and Verizon Media announced it would cut 7 percent from its newsrooms at HuffPost, AOL and Yahoo. Worst of all, a wave of layoffs tore through Gannett newsrooms across the country that day, hitting staffs that had already been thinned by years of nearly annual cuts. In December, Gannett's USA Today Network president, Maribel Wadsworth, told her employees that the nation's largest-circulation newspaper chain "will be a smaller company" in the future and, well, the future is now. Wadsworth is facing a lot of pressures: Print revenue is down, digital and mobile revenue aren't nearly enough, and now a hedge fund promising even deeper cuts wants to acquire the company. If the future of corporate news operations looks bleak, that's because it is.
In Tennessee, we've been watching the slow-motion destruction of our news institutions under Gannett for a few decades now, and the idea that things are about to get even worse is appalling. As badly as the country needs strong coverage of national news these days, the local news landscape is important, too. And what happened here mirrors what's already happened in city after city.
The Nashville I grew up in was a two-newspaper town, home to a daily slugfest between the scrappy afternoon Nashville Banner and the larger morning Tennessean. For 91 years, the papers dueled with talented staffs that featured heavyweights like John Seigenthaler, Fred Russell and David Halberstam, and owners who loved sending those reporters to brawl over their favorite politicians and causes.
Both papers had their problems as well as successes, but the competition was healthy for a growing region. The papers fought for scoops, launched deep investigations into corruption, covered the institutions the city was built on and told the stories of its citizens. They gave readers a choice.
Then began the great unwinding. The Banner's owners sold the paper in 1998 to Gannett, the Tennessean's owner, for $65 million, and the chain immediately closed the Banner and absorbed about one-third of its staff into the morning paper, giving it a robust newsroom of about 180 journalists. The Banner's archives were donated to the city's downtown library, and the trademark was allowed to lapse, another afternoon publication consigned to history.
Since then, the Tennessean's newsroom has been slashed more than 60 percent. Barely 70 journalists remain to cover a city that has grown by more than 20 percent since the sale and a region that's grown by roughly 50 percent. Middle Tennessee has an economy of nearly 2 million people fueled by health care, music, auto manufacturing and a multibillion-dollar tourism industry - and the state's largest news organization is a shell of itself, and cut more staff this past week.
It's rare to find a year in the past decade when Gannett did not offer some sort of buyout or impose layoffs in places such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Tallahassee and Phoenix. Forced to take a machete to their payrolls, editors throughout the chain did what their Nashville counterparts were forced to do: eliminate positions, consolidate beats, cut editors and proofreaders, and ship production work off to distant corporate hubs that function like boiler rooms. Advertising and circulation haven't escaped the ax, either. Want to buy an ad? You're more likely to talk to someone in a call center in New Jersey than a sales rep in your city.
Those cuts continue to reverberate.
Gannett bought up many of the small papers around Nashville and minimized or eliminated them, rolling them into the Tennessean's "brand" like something out of Star Trek. The company acquired dailies in Memphis and Knoxville to control three of the four biggest markets in the state, a strategy targeted at advertisers more than readers. With most of the state's major news outlets, Gannett eliminated redundancy, which is great if you're counting widgets but awful if you want, say, more than one reporter covering a statewide campaign for governor.
And now stories go unreported. In July, for example, local hospital operators LifePoint Health and RCCH HealthCare Partners merged in a nearly $6 billion deal that affected roughly 1,000 local employees. The Tennessean covered the story with an Associated Press dispatch written in New York, followed by a local rewrite of a news release at the end of the day. There was no follow-up coverage despite LifePoint's founder receiving a $70 million exit package and 250 jobs getting eliminated.
How did this happen? Years of erosion have damaged the paper's ability to cover the community. This is true everywhere: Since 1990, nearly 65 percent of all newspaper jobs have been eliminated, more than in the fishing, steel or coal industries.
As bleak as all of this sounds, the butcher's butcher is waiting. This month, Alden Capital tendered an offer to buy Gannett for $12 a share, a 23 percent premium above the price where it was trading. The hedge fund made news last year with draconian cuts at the Denver Post and other papers in its Digital First Media chain. A lawsuit alleges that Alden siphoned off millions from its newspapers to make up for losses from risky investments.
Gannett is ripe for a hedge fund raid, because cost containment has been the company's only successful strategy for years. On the print side, Gannett is actively alienating its core readership - still its most valuable source of revenue - by reducing pages, cutting features and moving up deadlines so that virtually nothing that happens after 6 p.m. makes the next day's paper. That includes sports scores, city council meetings and major news: When Nashville holds local elections this year, those results won't make it into print for two days.
On the digital side, Tennessean managers say they don't measure employee performance based on page views, yet staff members tell me they are instructed to scan Twitter and Facebook trends and write stories that capture traffic from social media. The company's digital strategy is less about serving an audience and more about rolling every digital click possible into a pile and trying to monetize it. That attitude manifests itself in stories crammed with so many ads that they're hard to read, autoplay video that people angrily rush to turn off and giant ad takeover campaigns that alienate visitors. And yet, if Alden is successful in its bid, we might look back on these as the good times.
So what is the right response if your largest local news organization is firmly in corporate crosshairs? "I say to everyone, 'Gannett made the Daily Memphian possible,' " says Eric Barnes, the president and executive editor of the newest media outlet in Memphis. Barnes and a group of local journalists and civic leaders, concerned about the decay of the Commercial Appeal under Gannett, formed a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, raised $6.7 million and launched the Daily Memphian as an online-only news site in September. Its staff of 30 is almost as big as the Commercial Appeal's now that Gannett has shrunk the paper.
The Daily Memphian plans to use donor money as a kind of philanthropic venture capital, giving it several years to achieve fiscal sustainability. It's a model my colleagues and I plan to follow this year when we relaunch the Nashville Banner online under the umbrella of the newly formed Nashville Public Media. We've learned by now that leaving local news in the hands of shareholders will only get us less.
The nonprofit route, pioneered by outlets like the Texas Tribune, emphasizes generating most revenue directly from audiences through paywalls or membership. It's attractive because the local revenue model for Gannett, Digital First and other big newspaper chains is irrevocably broken. Unless you have the scale of The Washington Post or the New York Times, the print advertising dollars that newspapers are hemorrhaging are being replaced by digital dimes or even pennies.
All over America, we need something different: We need more reporters covering the issues that matter to our communities. We need to stem the crisis in statehouse reporting; here in Nashville, the Capitol Hill press corps has dwindled from 35 to just 10 over a few decades. We need more investigative power to follow the billions of dollars spent by state and local governments, often with little oversight. We need competition in places where corporate news has carved out monopolies and let local news wither.
And we need to do it fast, because the butchers are sharpening their knives.

Texto completo: Media gushes over freshman lawmaker despite penchant for inaccuracy
WASHINGTON - If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is.
She would be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge, and brutal sketches on "Saturday Night Live mocking her intelligence and fitness for office.
Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS's "Late Show host Stephen Colbert - far from making jokes at her expense - eats ice cream with her and asks how many "f - s she gives about her critics.
Boy, it's good to be a socialist.
It's not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ocasio-Cortez declared that "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change. She has said that $21 trillion in "Pentagon accounting errors could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan - as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars sitting around in a Pentagon vault.
She opined that "just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn't even ask for - unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009 - when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has remained flat.
She has declared that "unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs - which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only 6 million to 7 million Americans with two jobs and 148 million with just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. "There's a lot of things we can't do as freshman members, she said. "We can't properly set up our district offices. We can't get laptops delivered. We can't start doing the work that we were elected here to do. & It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed.
That's wrong. Last September, Congress passed the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which funds congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid.
The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have managed to open offices in their districts. A more likely explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning "The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like "Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine? to see if she knows what it is?
Nowhere to be found. To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a "Pants on Fire rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Post Pinnochios - so much so that she claims to be the victim of "false equivalency + bias.
Give me a break. She told CBS's "60 Minutes that "being morally right is more important than "being precisely, factually ... correct. Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals - from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the "Green New Deal. The price tag was $42.5 trillion over the next decade - more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can't pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a tremendous testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender in a Mexican restaurant a year ago can throw their hat into the ring, unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives.
It's what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn't excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even Whoopi Goldberg, an Ocasio-Cortez supporter, warned her on "The View, "I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.
That's good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it's hard to recover - just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Texto completo: Sometimes the best motivation is watching other people accomplish something you, too, would like to achieve.
In our case, my husband and I are always looking for ways to get more organized and deal with an accumulation of things that never seems to end.
Enter Marie Kondo.
The Japanese tidying expert is famous for her “KonMari” method, which encourages cleaning by category (i.e., clothing, books, sentimental items) rather than by room. The catchphrase people are familiar with is whether an item “sparks joy” — if it does, keep it. If not, thank the item for its service and get rid of it.
Kondo’s 2014 book, “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” quickly became a New York Times best-seller. And this year she debuted a Netflix series, “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo,” that allows viewers to see the KonMari method in action.
While we didn’t pick up her book, we knew who Kondo was and occasionally mentioned wanting to try her approach. Then we effectively binge-watched the series and came away more motivated than ever to organize our life.
The episodes are both educational and entertaining. Kondo is a delight to watch, and it truly is inspiring to see families of all kinds transform their homes.
It’s more than just a cleaning show, though. As we watched the eight households come to grips with their messy situations, we realized that each episode also gently illuminates the frustration and challenges the couples face in their relationships. (One episode features a woman whose husband had recently died, and she had to learn how to be her own person again while honoring her husband’s memory.)
After we finished the series, my husband and I set about looking for how we could apply the KonMari method to our own space.
Some tips were no-brainers that we simply had never thought of, such as using storage bins pretty much everywhere in the house — small ones for sentimental items, large ones for things like towels and seasonal decor.
Other KonMari tricks, though, have become game-changers, namely how to fold our “sparks joy” clothes in a way that is both neat and display-worthy. I thought I knew how to store socks until Marie Kondo came along.
My husband and I still have a long way to go, and we don’t follow the KonMari method precisely; it’s easy to get distracted and organize by area rather than by category. But we’re gradually sorting through our stuff and organizing our life. Eventually, we hope, we’ll only be surrounded by things that spark joy.

Texto completo: As a decades-long independent, I find the behavior of the Republican and Democratic Party leadership in Washington disgraceful, embarrassing, unpatriotic and dangerous. They, along with their respective cronies in the media, have successfully divided the country into opposing factions who disregard the Constitution, precedent and common sense, whenever convenient.
Extremists now control the narrative, and party leaders play to the fringes. Democrats in particular are now supporting and electing candidates with far-left ideologies who state their support of socialism and radical ideas that have always been considered extremely dangerous to our Democratic principles. This radicalism is currently disguised as hatred for Trump, but consider the day Trump leaves and ask yourself, will they suddenly become less radical regardless of who is president? Can you say, “slippery slope”?
Good people on both sides have fallen victim to the tactics of “divide and conquer.” It’s no longer what is best for America, but what is best for your side.
In addition, the duplicity of the media cannot be ignored. Their ratings (and revenues) are driven by playing to their respective “sides” and their good fortune of having a high percentage of gullible, easily led followers. Facts are the victim.
The Greatest Generation has been replaced by the “divided generation,” and permanent gridlock. Washington is broken, and as long as so many citizens view everything from the ends rather than the middle, don’t expect improvement. Going to bed at night believing Obama was a Kenyan or Trump is a Russian spy might make you the problem.

Medicare for all? It’s not free
Certain politicians have been proposing the idea of Medicare for all. Sounds great, right? What they are not telling the public is that Medicare is not free. Consider Original Medicare 2019 :
Part A: Premiums: Less than 30 quarters working (Medicare taxes paid), $437 per month; 30-39 quarters working, $240 per month; over 40 quarters working, $0 per month.
Part B: Premiums: $135 to $460 per month, depending on income.
Part D: Premiums: Depends on the insurance company selected plus $0-$78 per month, depending on income.
Medigap insurance: Parts A and B only cover 80 percent. This covers the remaining 20 percent. Depending on which of the 13 plans selected, it costs $34-$248 per month.
Parts A, B and D have deductibles, copays and/or coinsurances. There are severe lifetime penalties if one delays getting Parts B and D. There is no maximum out-of-pocket per year. For example, the deductible for Part A is $1,364 per benefit period, and there can be several benefit periods per year.
Don’t forget the 7.65 percent the feds take out of every paycheck. Part of that goes to Medicare. With Medicare for all, it will go higher.
Consider the government’s record managing Social Security (estimated bankruptcy in 2034), Medicare (estimated bankruptcy in 2026) and the VA hospitals. The government’s latest foray into health insurance, the Affordable Care Act, has resulted in enormous increases in premiums and deductibles. Medicare for all. Is it for you?

Preventing gerrymandering
With news of the Supreme Court open to hearing gerrymandering cases from North Carolina and Maryland, it’s time to fan the inferno about Pennsylvania’s own redistricting reform.
For a long time, I believed that promoting an independent, nonpartisan citizens’ commission on redistricting that is proposed by Fair Districts PA was the right answer. Someone asked me who would pick the people to serve on the commission, and I realized that there is no such thing as an independent, nonpartisan anything.
A commission would just be another layer of partisan bureaucracy for our ever-functional state government. Such a thing was killed by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe anyway last year when he eviscerated House Bills 722 and 563 and Senate Bill 22 as chairman of the House State Government Committee. Maybe he unwittingly did us a favor?
Since it seems impossible to wrangle control from the General Assembly, let’s work with that instead of trying to fight it. What we need is to write the rules to be idiot-proof, or even Metcalfe-proof. We need to lay out the terms of drawing district lines so explicitly that it would be impossible to gerrymander ever again.
Keep districts compact. Only use geography and population data from the census, then feed it to a computer algorithm and press a button. Instead of trying to circumvent the Legislature, let’s use it to our advantage. It’s like the old saying, if you can’t go around a thing, go through it.
Jeffrey Vermeire, Collier
Fanning flames of Russian hysteria
“Without presenting any evidence, President Trump said ... .” This is how the media covers the Trump administration, with additional commentary accusing him of lying.
The New York Times on Jan. 11 published a piece about the FBI’s inquiry into the possibility that Trump was working on behalf of Russia. Subsequent stories have been published. Despite The New York Times not presenting any evidence, it is praised for publishing a “bombshell” report that is causing additional Russia hysteria.
The only evidence presented was the last paragraph: “No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. An FBI spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office both declined to comment.”
If The New York Times was consistent in its reporting, the Russia “bombshell” article would have begun with “Without any evidence, we’re accusing Trump of being a Russian agent.”

2 cheers for Gov. Tom Wolf
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was established several years ago by Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont “to support the development and implementation of each RGGI State’s CO2 Budget Trading Program” using a cap-and-trade mechanism to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
In the last couple of months, Gov. Tom Wolf, directly or indirectly, has taken two actions to make Pennsylvania a “greener” state. In mid-December, the state joined the RGGI states in agreeing to abide by a regional plan to cut transportation emissions. Then, on Jan. 8, the governor signed an executive order that commits Pennsylvania to setting targets to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Two cheers for the governor! To get the third cheer, he should find a way for the state to fully join RGGI.
At Citizens’ Climate Lobby, we believe that the real key to slowing the increase of the planet’s temperature is to enact the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which has been introduced in both houses of Congress in Washington with bipartisan support. It’s a better way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than a cap-and-trade process; but given the strong headwinds inside the Beltway, getting local and state governments to do more to save the planet makes a lot sense.
I look forward to giving the governor a third cheer in the near future.

Quit politicizing the border wall
I find it disturbing that the crisis of the wall (barrier?) has been politicized to this point. What I would like to see is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the rest of those who say there is no crisis bused to the border, where they can actually see what’s going on instead of parroting what someone else is telling them.
I doubt either Pelosi or Schumer have ever even spent one night at a Red Roof Inn or driven alone through any area outside their comfort zones. They live and work behind their fences or walls with armed security.
Walls are immoral? Where the heck did Pelosi get that from? It doesn’t even make sense. Walls and barriers are everywhere and have been for thousands of years. After 911, walls and barriers went up all over the nation to protect American citizens from threats from those who are here legally or illegally.
The right thing to do is finish what was started years ago by past administrations, both Democrat and Republican. Complete the wall or barrier. Who cares what it is called? Anything to stop the chaos coming across our borders. Everyone knows it’s not the full answer to stop border crossings, just one large of the piece of the puzzle needed to stop or slow the illegal crossing.
Quit politicizing this issue and finish the wall and fix DACA.
Renee Deglau, Hempfield
‘Wall’ issue is a ‘will’ issue
The Bible is clear on how to handle immigrants. Exodus 22:21 says, “You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him.” This is repeated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.
Exodus 12:49 says, “One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the foreigner who sojourns among you,” repeated in Numbers and Leviticus. One law for all. Some of those coming into our country do not want to submit to the laws of the nation or to God’s laws.
Walls work. Israel heard the outcry of racism as its wall was being built, but suicide bombings by those behind the wall decreased dramatically once it was completed. On the negative side, the Berlin Wall separated entire families and millions from freedom for nearly three decades.
America not only needs a wall, it needs the will to protect its citizens.
While the media and progressives can argue President Trump’s numbers, the facts are that bad things are happening because of lax border security. A report from the Center for Immigration Studies indicates that in 2014, ICE released 30,558 criminal aliens, convicted of 92,347 crimes. These aliens were convicted of 2,560 crimes after ICE released them.
When presented with these facts, some try to refute them with charges of racism or other such labels. This is not a “wall” issue. It’s a “will” issue. The will of the lawless verses the will of the just.
We have walls for protection, not because we hate people on the outside.

Texto completo: Manitowoc Treehouse Theater students won a national Freddie G Award for Excellence in Music and earned other recognition at the 2019 Junior Theater Festival Atlanta Jan. 18-20 at The Cobb Galleria Centre in Atlanta.
The Junior Theater Festival Atlanta united 6,600-plus students and educators from 133 educational musical theater groups representing 28 states, Australia, China, New Zealand and the U.K.
The Treehouse Theater students presented selections from "Disney's Aladdin JR." for director, choreographer, performer and assistant professor of musical theater dance Jacob Brent and Tali Allen, director of education and outreach at STAGES St. Louis.
"Treehouse Theater had excellent musicianship throughout the cast," Allen said. "They had great energy from start to finish."
Brent added: "This group blew me away. Their ability to work as a team to bring this musical to life was inspirational. Every one of them was in it to win it!"
Treehouse Theater's Kiersten Moser and Maya Paige made it to the call-back for future Broadway Junior shoots for "how-to" choreography videos for soon-to-be-released Broadway Junior musicals. The shoots will be taped in New York City this summer.
The Broadway Junior scouts were on the lookout for outstanding students, 181 of whom made it to the final call back for iTheatrics resident choreographer Steven G. Kennedy. The final cast will be determined later this year. These videos will be used in tens of thousands of schools across the country and internationally.
Treehouse Theater's Noah Babich and Maya Pagel were named to the Junior Theater Festival All-Stars, made up of outstanding performers attending the festival. The All-Stars performed a song during the closing ceremony for all 6,600 festival attendees.
Treehouse Theater is a non-profit youth organization that formed in April 2012. During the 2017-2018 season, Treehouse showcased 175 students, ages 4-18, who attend 28 different schools. A new record audience total of 3,200 patrons filled nearly every seat for the three musical productions — "Disney's The Lion King KIDS," "Disney's The Little Mermaid JR." and "Disney's Madagascar JR."

Stone has long history in Broward County

Texto completo: Roger Stone, a longtime associate of President Donald Trump who was arrested by the FBI in Fort Lauderdale on Friday in a dramatic, predawn raid, is one of South Florida's most politically notorious residents.
Stone had long predicted that he might be indicted as the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign moved closer and closer to him during 2018.
After his first court appearance on Friday, Stone defiantly maintained his innocence, denounced Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and pledged his unwavering loyalty to Trump.
Stone operates on the national political stage, but Fort Lauderdale is his home base. He lives in a rented, $1.6 million home on one of the finger islands off Las Olas Boulevard - a prestigious address.
Stone lives with his wife, the Cuban-born Nydia Bertran Stone, and their dogs. His stepson, Scott Stone, is a detective at the Broward Sheriff's Office.
He hasn't shied from the negative spotlight. Instead, he has reminded readers of his troubles, in mass emails from his Stone Zone blog.
In July, for example, one email told readers that "Stone has been a subject of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations and said he may be facing indictment for unspecified crimes arising from the 2016 presidential campaign."
Ground zero Broward
Stone said he first publicly mentioned that he'd had contact with Julian Assange of Wikileaks in an August 2016 speech to the Southwest Broward Republicans in Pembroke Pines.
He later said he didn't directly communicate with Wikileaks or Assange but used an intermediary "confirming source," whom he identified as comedian Randy Credico.
Stone returned to the club in June 2018, calling it the "scene of no crime." He told the Southwest Broward Republicans that he received nothing from Assange or from the Russian state, and thus passed nothing on to the Trump campaign or to Trump himself.
"Now, it is not inconceivable," he said, "that the special counsel could still go out and conjure up some offense against me in an attempt to get me to testify against the president. But my independent political activities on behalf of the president are perfectly legal and meticulous. There is no evidence of Russian collusion."
He said he'd already spilled his guts to the Senate Intelligence Committee, an experience he likened to "a proctological examination."
Bush lite
Broward voters have had a taste of Stone's electioneering tactics, a menu of shenanigans that earned him the lasting moniker "dirty trickster."
Stone typically doesn't bother with local races. But the Broward sheriff's post is an exception.
First, in 2008, Stone worked to get then-Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti re-elected. Lamberti, a Republican, defeated challenger Scott Israel, a Democrat.
Four years later, Stone, a Libertarian, switched sides and helped Israel defeat Lamberti.
Stone's calling card is the misleading robocall, using Caller ID spoofing.
Democratic voters in the 2008 race, for example, received a Stone-created robocall from a George W. Bush sound-a-like, endorsing Israel as a like-minded Republican. Israel was a registered Democrat, and the call was designed to fool Democratic voters. The Caller ID made it appear the call came from an official Republican organization.
'Ain't beanbag'
The 2012 race also featured spoofing robocalls, as well as a Stone-affiliated Twitter account - Andrew Miller's Broward Bugle - that unleashed attacks on Israel's foes.
"We have zero control over the Bugle and Roger," said Stone's longtime friend Ron Gunzburger, who ran Israel's successful 2012 campaign and was hired as Broward Sheriff's Office general counsel. "No one can get Roger to do anything he doesn't want to do."
"Politics in South Florida ain't beanbag," Stone told the Sun Sentinel at the time. "My activities are legal and protected by the First Amendment. When I do it, I just do it better."
Stone had help.
Credico, a comedian and impersonator now ensnared in the Mueller investigation, has admitted working with Stone on the 2008 and 2012 Broward sheriff's campaigns.
Among the characters on the robocalls: Al Sharpton, former President George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani and Richard Nixon.
"He had me doing some dirty tricks I don't want to get into," Credico told the New York Times, before explaining the impressionistic robocalls. "Both times. Had me doing things that were untoward."
On Sept. 7, Credico told CNN he testified before the Mueller grand jury.
"Most of it was about Roger Stone," he told MSNBC in a televised interview on Sept. 10.
Bomb thrower
In 2016, Stone said he had "bigger fish to fry" than the local races.
He was helping his friend of nearly 40 years, Donald Trump, get elected.
To that end, Stone started a false rumor that Broward Elections Supervisor Dr. Brenda Snipes met with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The allegation fed Trump's conspiracy theories that the election would be rigged. The insinuation was that Snipes, a Democrat, was in league with the Democratic nominee.
Snipes called the allegation a "big, fat lie." Stone claimed he would provide proof on Infowars.com, the domain of far-right commentator Alex Jones. But, he didn't.
Lawyering up
For legal representation in the Mueller matter, Stone is using two Fort Lauderdale-based attorneys.
Robert Buschel and Grant Smith are representing Stone. The three worked together at the now-defunct Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler law firm in Fort Lauderdale.
Media hardball
Stone has tangled with the media for years, hurling vulgarities on social media at his perceived enemies.
His pro-Sheriff-Israel Twitter account, the Broward Bugle, tweeted "C U Next Tuesday" to the Sun Sentinel's editorial board editor several years ago, for the crude acronym.
After he was banned from Twitter in 2017 for his frequent inflammatory and expletive-laden attacks on the media, he directed the same "C U Next Tuesday" slur on Instagram to a Vanity Fair reporter.
Did I mention I have a book for sale?
Stone capitalizes on his notoriety, hawking his books around South Florida, as he complains about a "witch hunt" against him.
A prolific author who tries to influence others, his books certainly are not about winning friends.
His titles include "Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family," "The Clintons' War on Women," and "The Man Who Killed Kennedy, the Case Against LBJ."
He parlays his place in the headlines into sales pitches for his books.
In a May email from his Stone Zone website, for example, he offers insight into how he has survived "the endless smears, personal attacks and innuendo" regarding Russian collusion.
Those insights, he said, are contained in his latest book, "Stone's Rules."
"Now you can read and employ these vital and current rules for yourself," it read.
Howard Appell, president of the Gold Coast Tiger Bay Club, said he has not heard from Stone about Stone's scheduled Feb. 13 appearance, but he's working on potential backups.
"We have a message into his manager," he said Friday. "We are waiting to see what happens in court."
He said he'd welcome Stone if he's still willing to speak. Stone has spoken several times at the club.
"If he is able to do it, absolutely," Appell said.
Back to square one
Though he's been in politics for decades, Stone earned his political chops working on the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon.
That explains the ink on Stone's back - a permanent, tattooed image of Nixon.
Stone once said in email to the Sun Sentinel that the tattoo is a reminder that no matter the setbacks, "when you get knocked down, you have to get up, dust yourself off and get back in the game - and never, ever quit."

Texto completo: President Trump remains bullish that the North Korea nuclear threat can be contained. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the president praised the "incredible meeting" he had the day before with a top representative of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, trumpeting the "tremendous progress" the two sides had made.
The optimistic view is that the White House meeting with Kim Yong-chol, a former North Korean intelligence chief and now his government's lead nuclear negotiator, was indeed productive, and Mr. Trump is on his way to resolving one of the world's most complex and dangerous nuclear weapons problems.
But a path to that outcome isn't yet visible to the outside world. North Korea has forgone nuclear tests, missile tests and rhetorical attacks for more than 400 days. That's an important development. At the same time, however, it continues to produce nuclear fuel, weapons and missiles. So, as the two leaders prepare for their second summit (reportedly next month in Vietnam), the pressure is on the Trump administration to articulate a realistic strategy for achieving a mutually agreed upon outcome.
No such strategy was evident last June when Mr. Trump broke with decades of foreign policy precedent by meeting directly with Mr. Kim in Singapore, in the first summit between American and North Korean leaders. Mr. Trump deserves credit for opening up this dialogue, but it has, so far, yielded few tangible results.
The one concrete product of the Singapore meeting, a concluding statement, was so poorly drafted that it laid the groundwork for months of stalemate. It committed the two leaders to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," without even defining "denuclearization," let alone explicitly agreeing on the sequence of actions to be taken.
Publicly, the two sides still hew to staunch positions: The Trump administration insists that tough sanctions will stay in place until North Korea completely gives up its nuclear arsenal. North Korean officials insist on sanctions relief early in the process.
But small signs of movement led to plans for the second summit. Mr. Trump backed off his insistence on immediate disarmament, and his administration recently eased travel restrictions so American aid workers and humanitarian supplies could once again enter the impoverished country.
Even if complete denuclearization is not possible, negotiators should at least seek a permanent end to testing and the production of fissile material.

Texto completo: "I was David Duke's worst nightmare."
Ron Stallworth
'Black Klansman'
"Let me tell you how it all started," Ron Stallworth told a crowd of over 700 people in Iowa City's Englert Theatre Wednesday night.
What unfolded that night was Stallworth, a retired black officer of the Colorado Springs Police Department, telling the unbelievable story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan in the 1970s, how he stopped cross burnings and how he was close to becoming a local leader for the white supremacist group.
"This sounds like a movie, doesn't it?" Stallworth asked as he stood on the Englert stage just a day after the movie "BlackKKlansman," based off his memoir, received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie was directed by trailblazing filmmaker Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Stallworth and Adam Driver as his partner in the investigation.
"I bet you thought you'd get John David Washington up here. But you got me," Stallworth said.
Stallworth's lecture was a part of the University of Iowa Lecture Committee's spring lineup of speakers. With an audience filled with students, locals and many more, Stallworth illustrated the connections between the hate and racism he confronted as a an undercover cop in the 1970s and what he sees today.
The former cop was direct when asked by an audience member about how to combat white supremacy today.
"You vote that idiot out of the White House," he said , referring to President Donald Trump.
"You vote that idiot congressman out of Congress, Iowa," he added about Iowa 4th District Rep. Steve King, who recently told the New York Times "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
"Why has it just become an issue for those good people who voted for him now? He's been saying these things for years, unless those people actually believe what he says," Stallworth said.
Before he took questions from the audience, Stallworth spent the majority of the lecture explaining the wild but true story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan as an undercover cop.
It started in 1978 when Stallworth was hired as the first black officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department. As an undercover officer, he was looking through the newspaper to see if there was anything of interest. He saw a recruitment ad for the KKK in town. He sent them a letter and absentmindedly used his real name, "not one of my two undercover names. I had a brain cramp that day," Stallworth said.
The next week he got a call from the KKK asking why he wanted to join. After he spewed a series of racial slurs aimed at black people, they asked him to meet the current KKK members.
"Obviously, because God blessed me with this beautiful ebony skin, I couldn't meet them," Stallworth said to a round of thunderous applause from the crowd. What he did was recruit a white officer that would be his white avatar and pose as him in face-to-face meetings.
He had to get approval from leadership first. A sergeant initially denied the request because, as Stallworth said, he thought the white officer didn't "sound like a black guy."
"I asked him what does a black guy sound like," Stallworth said, and the sergeant answered with silence. Other officers at the department told him that the white officer wouldn't be "shuckin' and jivin'" like a black person would.
Stallworth was coming face-to-face with racism within his own department, so he took the matter up with the chief himself.
"When you see that you're out to do something you know is right, that it's the right path, do it. Don't even let authority stop you," Stallworth said.
The chief gave him approval, and a white officer to pose as him, and the investigation was underway. For seven-and-a-half months, Stallworth would have full conversations over the phone with everyone from local KKK members to David Duke, then the Grand Wizard, the preeminent leader of the KKK.
"If he was up here instead of me, I guarantee you'd like him," Stallworth said, calling Duke slick, smart and nice. "Until he started talking about race."
Though Stallworth called them "not the brightest bulbs in the shed," what they discovered was alarming. The KKK had plans to bomb the town's two gay bars. Its membership was made up of a few soldiers from nearby Fort Carson, so they had the means to do such a thing.
One day, he was summoned by the FBI to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base, an installation literally built under a mountain in Colorado. High ranking officials looked at his investigation and discovered two KKK members were higher-ups at North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, and that they had top security positions. Stallworth was told later that day the two men were removed from their positions in Colorado and sent to work at a base near the North Pole.
The investigation was shut down by the chief of police when the KKK members asked Stallworth to be their chapter leader. The chief told him to destroy all the documents about the investigation, but Stallworth ignored his command and kept the files. In 2014, after he retired, he wrote the memoir about his interactions with the KKK.
After the lecture, Stallworth took questions from the audience. One attendee asked about the movie. He detailed young screenwriters Charlie Wachtel ad David Rabinowitz calling him out of the blue to ask if anyone was making his memoir into the movie. He gave them approval to do so, but he had control over what would be in the script. Five drafts later, the script was finished. Soon, Lee would come on-board to give the movie the director's infamous political flair.
"These [writers,] hopefully in February, will win their first Academy Award," Stallworth said.
Stallworth saved possibly the the most unbelievable moment of his investigation, and one of the craziest moments in the movie, for near the end of his event.
When Duke himself visited town, Stallworth was picked to be Duke's bodyguard since the Grand Wizard had received death threats. Though he was worried that Duke may recognize his voice, the chief said no one else was available.
So he did his job, shook hands with Duke and protected him throughout his visit to town. The day came to a crescendo when the cop asked for a photo with Duke and the Colorado leader of the KKK. They agreed, so Stallworth handed a camera to the undercover cop posing as a KKK member. Right before the photo was snapped, Stallworth put his arms around both white supremacists.
Duke was furious, and demanded the photo be destroyed. Stallworth told him if the Grand Wizard touched him, he'd be arrested for assaulting a police officer. Duke sulked away and started spouting his white supremacist rhetoric.
"I was David Duke's worst nightmare," Stallworth said to the crowd. "I was a n***** with a badge and a gun and I have the authority to kick his ass." The crowd cheered wildly and the Black Klansman himself smiled.

Texto completo: Print journalism has become like one of those garbage dumps on the outskirts of Mumbai. People crawl all over the humongous mounds ferreting for anything they can sell. Maybe they find a bit of aluminum. Mainly it's garbage. It is exceedingly difficult to escape the conclusion that American journalism has entered a similar transformative ranking that shapes the content of our ugly public discourse and the chaotic direction of our governance for the current generation.
The quality of our democracy is entwined deeply with the quality of our journalism, and that is the problem that confronts us today.
The Washington Post and the New York Times are as guilty as "BuzzFeed" and multiple news outlets for printing journalism biased with their political views. Objectivity is loss, thus not affording the reader to split the difference.
Following the BuzzFeed's flawed news report political party leaders stampeded into discussing a plethora of proceedings toward impeachment. FBI special counsel, Robert Mueller, observed acutely the ramifications the fake news report was having to bring down a presidency. After 24 hours of thorough investigation of internal documents by his staff to verify the accuracy of the BuzzFeed report, Mr Mueller took the unprecedented intervention to announce publicly the BuzzFeed report had "no credibility."
The late Walter Lippmann, the quintessential Washington journalistic insider, described journalism as "...the last refuge of the vaguely talented." Journalism is worse today than when Mr. Lippmann made his unsavory judgment.
The cancerous prejudice, the toxic stereotype and morbid fear inculcated within many citizens today come not from this administration, but from the likes of the WP, the NYT, the BuzzFeed who regurgitate their junk food of political biases and prejudices targeted at unconscious readers morbidly obese in mind and spirit, indoctrinated and fed only partisan information and opinions that confirm journalists' own biases.
As journalists lose credibility among their subscribers the news business finds its financial prospects clouded, its leaders and employees dispirited, its industry in meltdown; and, an American public taking solace that their government belongs to them, and not to the press.

Texto completo: Ryan Coogler's "Rocky" reboot airs on Paramount Network. And Paul Schrader's bleak, rhythmic "First Reformed" streams on Kanopy.
What's on TV
CREED (2015) 8 p.m. on Paramount Network. He may not have been nominated for an Academy Award for best director this week, but Ryan Coogler is still making history. His "Black Panther," which he directed and co-wrote, is the first superhero movie to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. And it's only Coogler's third feature. "Creed," his second, resurrected Rocky Balboa for a new generation through a story centered on a young boxer, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the son of Rocky's enemy-turned-comrade Apollo Creed. An older, weathered Rocky (Sylvester Stallone, of course) takes Adonis under his wing. We also see the blossoming of a relationship between Adonis and a Philadelphia musician (Tessa Thompson) and a scene on those Philadelphia Museum of Art steps Stallone ran up about 40 years earlier. The movie manages to be "self-aware without being cute about it," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He said that Coogler "looks at the Rocky story and the tradition of Hollywood pugilism through a fresh prism" and that the film itself is at once "soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date."
ROY WOOD JR.: NO ONE LOVES YOU 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on "The Daily Show," tackles the N.F.L. national anthem controversy, the challenges faced by black superheroes and many other subjects in this hourlong comedy special, filmed at the Vic Theater in Chicago. "America is a restaurant that sells equality," he observes from the stage. "Some of you all had some delicious equality, it was good, you had great service. And some of us need to speak to a manager."
What's Streaming
FIRST REFORMED (2018) Stream on Kanopy; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I know that nothing can change, and I know there is no hope." Paul Schrader's rhythmic and bleak exploration of faith in the face of depression and environmental ruin stars Ethan Hawke as a tortured Protestant minister who writes lines like the above in his diary. He diligently maintains a small church in upstate New York, even while his health fails, his sense that there is corruption in his own institution grows and his view that the earth itself is deteriorating along with him reaches a boiling point. "It is the portrait of a soul in torment," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "all the more powerful for being so rigorously conceived and meticulously executed."
A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN on BroadwayHD. Mary Bridget Davies stars in this tribute to the singer, which mixes Joplin's music with biographical reflections. In his review for The Times, Charles Isherwood called Davies's impersonation of the singer "positively uncanny," writing that she sings Joplin's songs "with a throbbing fervor that is often riveting."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Lawmakers are investigating the Twitter account that first shared a video of a group of white teenagers taunting a Native American protester in Washington, a collision of racial groups and politics that went viral.
The House Intelligence Committee asked Twitter on Tuesday to provide information about how the video took off so fast. The committee said it was also awaiting information about the account that first uploaded the video and accounts that helped spread it by retweeting it.
Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, separately asked Twitter to provide more information about the video. A spokeswoman for Mr. Warner said Twitter had found that the account originated in the United States.
Twitter declined to comment on the video, on the requests from the Intelligence Committee and Mr. Warner, and on whether the account was domestic.
The lawmakers' moves were part of a cycle of outrage around the video. Uploaded to Twitter on Saturday by an account called @2020fight, which claimed to be run by a teacher named Talia, it showed a group of white high school students wearing "Make America Great Again" hats and encircling a Native American protester at the Lincoln Memorial. It was viewed at least 2.5 million times and retweeted at least 14,400 times before the account was removed.
Videos that emerged later showed that before the teenagers' encounter with the protester, African-American demonstrators who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites had shouted slurs at the students.
The video touched a nerve in many Americans, exposing fault lines between conservative and liberal groups that each believed the video showed the other side behaving inappropriately.
Liberal groups said the teenagers, from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, were intimidating a protester who was fighting for indigenous people's rights. Conservative groups said the teenagers were being maligned and targeted for simply standing their ground while on a school trip. Days after it was posted, the video remains a topic of fierce debate.
A spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee didn't return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Warner said lawmakers had focused on the video and who might be behind it as part of their efforts to combat foreign interference in political campaigns. During the 2016 presidential race, for example, Russian operatives posted inflammatory videos and other content to stoke divisions among the American electorate.
The identity of the person or people behind @2020fight remains unknown. The account used a profile picture of a Brazilian social media personality, Nah Cardoso, and purported to belong to an educator and advocate. It posted more than 100 times a day, including many overtly political messages that resonated widely on Twitter.
Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California, retweeted a post from @2020fight in 2017, according to a database compiled by The New York Times. Another tweet, about President Trump in August, received nearly 130,000 retweets.
The profile photo tipped off CNN, and eventually Twitter, that the account may not have been run by the person it claimed. While Twitter does not mandate that people use their real names or photos on their accounts, the company forbids impersonation. After CNN raised questions about the user's identity, Twitter suspended the @2020fight account on Monday.
Twitter said users who were suspended because of misleading account information could get their accounts reinstated if they provided proof of their identity, such as a valid government ID. As of Wednesday, the account remained shut down.
The account appeared to be part of a network of users dedicated to amplifying one another on Twitter, said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies disinformation.
Mr. Nimmo noted that the account had roughly 30,000 followers and followed just over 30,000 accounts since becoming active in December 2016, adding: "The sheer number of tweets and likes it has are not the kind of signature you get from a casual Twitter user."
Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher at the New Media Frontier, a company that studies social media, also examined the account and said it appeared to be part of a structure that was built to go viral.
"These types of accounts, and the bigger network they belong to, exist to create an amplification structure on Twitter," she said. "They amplify each other's content to create viral moments on the network."

Texto completo: Warriors skip White House, leaving their star guard time to discuss powerful new film
When the Golden State Warriors came to Washington last season as the defending NBA champions, they did not visit the White House - to much discussion. Stephen Curry had expressed ambivalence about the visit, and President Trump publicly disinvited the team via tweet. Instead, the Warriors opted for a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture with a group of students.
There was less drama this time, just a statement by the Warriors last fall following another title that they would steer clear of the White House and focus their efforts on community outreach.
And so on Wednesday afternoon Kevin Durant opened an after-school facility in the D.C. area. And later that night, Curry visited Howard University for a screening of a documentary about the Emanuel AME Church shooting - a film he executive produced.
"Athletes in general, especially in the NBA, guys are educated. They know what they're talking about," Curry said during a panel discussion. "They know what they believe. And there's a reason when you say something there are headlines. People want to hear what you have to say. We shouldn't shy away from it.
"We have a league that supports each other," he continued. "We have a commissioner [Adam Silver] that supports us in using our voice to speak for those who can't speak for themselves. And I think this era of athlete is unafraid to be unapologetically themselves, whatever that means."
Curry was speaking after the screening of "Emanuel," a documentary that chronicles the events of the 2015 shooting of nine African Americans at a bible study class at a church in Charleston, S.C. Curry's production company, Unanimous Media, is helping to market and distribute the film, which will have a small theater release on the fourth anniversary of the shooting, June 17.
Asked about getting involved in the project, Curry talked about the film's focus on the victims' family members, many of whom in the days after the massacre chose to forgive the shooter, Dylann Roof.
"How were they going to move forward and deal with this tragedy?" Curry said. "They chose forgiveness, and they chose faith and chose to support each other and the community coming together around them. That alone speaks volumes of humanity and the hope in humanity. We wanted to be able to tell that story."
Unanimous was founded last year in partnership with Sony by Curry, Erick Peyton and Jeron Smith, who worked on digital initiatives in the Obama White House. "Emanuel" is the company's first project. On Wednesday night, Curry was flanked onstage by Smith and the movie's director, Brian Ivie, as well as moderator Lauretta Charlton, an editor at the New York Times.
"To be honest, how often this happens in our country - way too often - you almost get numb to it," Curry said, recalling when he first learned of the shooting. "You don't want to have that initial reaction because it's such a traumatic thing for the family in terms of what they're going through. And again, how often, how frequent it is. It just makes you angry."
Curry is not the first basketball star to launch a production company. LeBron James's SpringHill Entertainment produces "The Shop," an HBO docuseries that features James traveling to barbershops around the country and having conversations about race, sports and life. SpringHill also developed "Shut Up & Dribble," a film about athletes and politics named after Fox News's Laura Ingraham's put-down of James and other athletes speaking out.
Unanimous, meanwhile, is producing the upcoming feature film "Breakthrough," about a boy who drowns and is dead for nearly an hour before his mother's prayers help revive him. Curry is an executive producer.
"I don't want to say we're walking in his shadows," Peyton said. "But LeBron had a head start on us. Stephen wants to inspire people, and he wants to do it through media."
Curry has been critical of the Trump administration in the past. After the CEO of Under Armour, one of Curry's sponsors, called Trump an "asset to the country," Curry said he agreed with the sentiment, if you removed the "et." The conversation after the film Wednesday evening was not expressly political and included no mention of Trump, though the crowd at Howard's Cramton Auditorium cheered wildly when former president Barack Obama appeared on the screen during the movie. "Come back!" yelled an audience member. Former South Carolina governor and Trump administration official Nikki Haley was interviewed in the film.
With "Emanuel" focusing so much on the themes of faith, tragedy and forgiveness, Curry was asked for his thoughts on the death penalty. He said he is against it.
"There are situations where an individual can be redeemed or be healed - mentally, physically, whatever the issue is," he said. "Just in terms of what I believe in humanity and the redeeming qualities of my lord and savior and what that means for somebody going through the worst, nothing's impossible."

The Bookshop Band writes new chapter at SOMOS

Texto completo: Scottish musicians Ben Please and Beth Porter are partners in life and as the duo The Bookshop Band. They will be in town Tuesday (Jan. 29) to record a concert album called "Best of The Bookshop Band," starting at 7 p.m.
It all happens at SOMOS, 108-B Civic Plaza Drive. The Bookshop Band's recording at SOMOS is funded by a grant from the Scottish government and SOMOS. An image of Taos will be on the album cover.
The duo started in Bath, England, at a small pub called Mr. B's Emporium of Reading Delights, which features author-themed evenings paired with themed food and music.
Prior to the event the duo had a short time to read and digest the featured book, then present a song. Please described the experience as a "songwriting challenge - books are so rich and inspiring, there is so much content in a book, [and] the challenge is to trust your instincts about what resonates with you ... close the book, go with your first thought and that can come from anywhere in the book." He continued, "We always talk about the book before - you take the stimulus, pause and translate your emotional response, which then becomes another work of art."
According to the duo's website, since their start in Bath, The Bookshop Band has "played in over 200 bookshops around the United Kingdom, Ireland and France, writing songs inspired by over 100 books curated by Mr. B's."
Please said the songwriting and performance form the musicians' "letter to the author." Most people are surprised and moved by the interpretation. "Sometimes there are tears and delight from the authors in the audience; some get very emotional," he said. The night they performed a piece inspired by "Don't Let the Dogs Out Tonight," a memoir by Alexandra Fuller about life with her family on a farm in Zimbabwe, the author became emotional and bolted from the audience which, according to Please, was "rather inconvenient because she was presenting her work next."
According to a SOMOS press release, "Audiences can expect to hear songs about everything from 'The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland' by Lewis Carroll and Shakespeare's 'Richard II' to Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Hilary Mantel's 'Bring Up the Bodies.' There's also a good chance that they will perform one of the songs they were commissioned to write for the launch of Philip Pullman's work 'The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage.' "
Porter and Please have collaborated with celebrated authors such as Ben Fountain, who wrote "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" - which became a feature film directed by Ang Lee - and Armistead Maupin, who wrote "Tales of the City." Some even feature as musicians on the band's 13 albums, like Man Booker winners Yann Martel ("Life of Pi") and Ben Okri ("The Famished Road"), and best-selling authors Joanne Harris ("Chocolat") and Louis de Bernières ("Captain Corelli's Mandolin").
The Bookshop Band has received commissions from the BBC, the Victorian and Albert Museum and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. They are regularly featured on "The Tom Robinson Show," and have been championed by Bob Harris on BBC Radio 2, describing their "fabulous new music." They are also mainstays of the annual Wigtown Book Festival, which attracts visitors from all around the world to the 10-day event in Scotland's National Book Town, situated in the rural region of Dumfries and Galloway.
Tempo asked Please if the duo continues to write as they started their career, inspired by one book at a time. He said they were looking forward to the American Booksellers Association's Winter Institute in Albuquerque this month, an event at which they were invited to perform as a response to a challenge issued by New York Times literary critic Dwight Garner, who said "The Bookshop Band is not just good but achingly good … If America's independent booksellers can't figure a way to get these two … to tour America, they're doing something wrong."
According to Please, author Margaret Atwood is presenting at the event. He said they haven't decided which of her books they'll read to inspire another song, but they plan to compose something. Please said he is thankful to the duo's sponsor, All Media Supply, which made the trip to the United States possible, paying not only for the plane ride but also the costly visa process.
Tickets to the recording session are $10, $8 for SOMOS members, although no one will be refused a seat for lack of funds. For more information, call the venue at (575) 758-0081 or visit somostaos.org.

Lawyers for Manafort Say Prosecutors Twisted Memory Lapses as Lies

Texto completo: Paul Manafort's lawyers on Wednesday strongly disputed claims by prosecutors working for the special counsel that Mr. Manafort repeatedly lied to them, including about the transfer of campaign polling data to a Russian citizen with ties to Kremlin-run intelligence services in spring 2016.
The lawyers argued in a new court filing that the prosecutors had wrongly interpreted honest memory lapses and innocent misstatements by Mr. Manafort as deliberate attempts to deceive them about his interactions with the Russian citizen, Konstantin Kilimnik, who received the polling data in 2016 as Donald J. Trump was closing in on the Republican presidential nomination.
"Failure of memory is not akin to a false statement," Mr. Manafort's lawyers said.
If the federal judge in Washington who is overseeing the case, Amy Berman Jackson, decides that Mr. Manafort intentionally misled the prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with them, she would presumably be less likely to show leniency on March 5, when she is to sentence him on two conspiracy charges.
But as a practical matter, Mr. Manafort, 69, stood little chance of receiving less than 10 years for those crimes even before prosecutors accused him of breaching his plea agreement by lying to them about his dealings with Mr. Kilimnik and other matters. He is also awaiting sentencing for eight other felonies.
Judge Jackson has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the prosecutors' accusations.
The defense team's 10-page filing was heavily redacted, but information inadvertently revealed in a previous court document made it possible to understand some of the lawyers' references.
They suggested that prosecutors had concluded that Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, had lied about the polling data transfer after they compared his statements to those of Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort's longtime deputy both in private business and during the campaign. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Manafort instructed Mr. Gates to transfer the information to Mr. Kilimnik, a longtime business associate of both men.
"The O.S.C. relies on Mr. Gates's testimony in an effort to contradict Mr. Manafort," the defense lawyers wrote, referring to the Office of Special Counsel. Why they contend that the prosecutors were wrong to do so is redacted.
The prosecutors have also accused Mr. Manafort of lying about how $125,000 donated to a pro-Trump political action committee was used to cover some of Mr. Manafort's debts for his legal defense. Investigators were apparently trying to determine whether the payment, made in 2017, constituted a kickback to Mr. Manafort from associates who ran the PAC.
But others familiar with the payment said that money was drawn from a commission owed to a PAC official who wanted to help Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort's lawyers wrote that he did not lie to the prosecutors about the payment, he simply "had difficulty remembering the details of what occurred."
A lawyer for Laurence Gay, who was once the managing director of the PAC, Rebuilding America Now, said in a statement that the money came from a different set of funds.
"In 2017 and at the request of Paul Manafort, Laurie asked that funds be forwarded to an entity designated by Mr. Manafort to assist with his legal expenses," said the lawyer, Anthony J. Iacullo, in response to a request for comment from Mr. Gay. "This was done with funds independent from those belonging to the PAC." He did not identify the source of funds.

Texto completo: Former President Bill Clinton is writing a book about his life since leaving the White House in 2001.

Angel Urena, a spokesman for the former president, confirmed the forthcoming book to the Washington Examiner . It will be the fifth book written by Clinton during his post-presidential life.

"President Clinton has no interest in relitigating 2016 or speculating about 2020 or Trump,” someone with knowledge of the deal told the Washington Examiner .

It wasn't clear how much Clinton will make from the book deal.

Clinton has been out of office for nearly 20 years, but appeared frequently on the campaign trail on behalf of his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during her presidential run. He was sidelined during the 2018 midterm elections as the #MeToo movement gained prominence and his own behavior toward women was criticized.

Paul Bogaards, an executive vice president for the publisher, told the New York Times no timeline has been set for publication.

Clinton co-authored the fictional novel The President Is Missing with bestselling novelist James Patterson in 2018. Clinton’s 2001 autobiography My Life sold more than 3 million copies.

Mike Pompeo: Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro can’t expel US diplomats

Texto completo: Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro lacks “the legal authority” to expel American diplomats, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday.

“The United States does not recognize the Maduro regime as the government of Venezuela,” Pompeo warned in a statement. “Accordingly the United States does not consider former president Nicolas Maduro to have the legal authority to break diplomatic relations with the United States or to declare our diplomats persona non grata.”

Maduro ordered the departure of American officials earlier Wednesday after President Trump announced his support for a leading opposition figure who has claimed the constitutional authority to supplant the socialist strongman. Trump backed Maduro’s ouster by affirming that National Assembly President Juan Guaido stands as the interim president of the country, days after the lawmaker declared Maduro’s inauguration invalid and invoked a constitutional provision authorizing him to assume the presidency and oversee new elections.

“The United States maintains diplomatic relations with Venezuela and will conduct our relations with Venezuela through the government of interim President Guaido, who has invited our mission to remain in Venezuela,” Pompeo said.

Maduro pledged to remain in office and ordered the State Department team to leave within 72 hours.

“We do not want to return to the 20th century of gringo interventions and coups d’etats,” Maduro said after Trump’s announcement, according to the New York Times.

Pompeo warned “the Venezuelan military and security forces” not to attempt to remove the diplomats by force or retaliate over their refusal. “We call on all parties to refrain from measures that are inconsistent with the privileges and immunities enjoyed by members of the diplomatic community,” he said. “The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel.”

Newly thoughtful media aren't going to get me to share in their blame for the fake Covington story they spread

Texto completo: It’s stunning to watch journalists become so thoughtful, with a renewed view of the world and all its complexities, once they’re caught pushing a demonstrably fake story.

Regarding the infamous scene with the Covington Catholic High School students and the Native American man provocatively banging his drum in their faces, liberals in the media are doing the same thing they do when they immediately assume any act of violence must be linked to President Trump, Republicans, or the Right, only to find out that the perpetrator was either mentally ill, or worse, a Democrat.

As in those cases, journalists are now finding that there’s an equal amount to blame among everyone for the fiery havoc they themselves caused.

It was the media and the Twitter mob (almost exclusively a liberal phenomenon) that initially pushed the narrative that a bunch of white and privileged kids were attempting to intimidate a defenseless minority. This was clearly fake. Yet New York Times columnist Frank Bruni somehow finds equal fault in conservatives who are now pointing that out.

“Some conservatives are gleeful about how this went down,” he wrote Tuesday. “But isn’t their vengeful joy its own rushed celebration, its own self-serving simplification of a complex sequence of events?”

Why, no, Frank, it was neither “rushed” nor “self-serving” for anyone to identify the inaccuracy of the media/mob portrayal of events — and especially not a full day after they pushed the fake story line, ruining reputations and lives with their recklessness. Not only is it not rushed, but it can't come soon enough — so many false and libelous stories have now circulated on social media thanks to his colleagues that half of Twitter seems to have chosen to believe the fake story over the video evidence.

Jonathan Capehart at the Washington Post offered what amounts to a parody in his column that posted last night. If his aim was to prove that big city liberals live in a bubble, incapable of understanding the life experiences of anyone outside of New York and Washington, he succeeded.

Capehart writes that the students and their chaperones, all of whom live in Kentucky, where the school is located, should have known better than to cross paths with fringe Black Israelite protesters who were first on location. But the kids had been told to converge on that spot. It was their meetup, and somehow it's their fault that the kooks were there that day, to taunt them with a torrent of hate speech.

“If the ranting and raving Black Hebrew Israelites are the kind of folks who necessitate my crossing the street or altering my path before I make it into their line of sight, why would the Covington kids and their minders think it’s okay to engage crazy, hateful people raising hell in a national park?” wrote Capehart. “They should have ignored the Black Hebrew Israelites the way most everyone else does …”

The location of the incident with the Covington kids, by the way, was the Lincoln Memorial. That’s a place you can reasonably expect visitors to the city to show up — unlike, say, at a lecture by Jonathan Capehart on deductive reasoning.

Why would Capehart assume that anyone outside of Washington, D.C., would be familiar with the habits of a little-known black nationalist cult? In Kentucky, it's possible that towns aren't peppered with radicals shouting words like "faggot" and "n----r" at children, as the Black Israelites were doing for long stretches on end. But it isn't likely. And if Capehart admitted that much he wouldn't be able to distribute the blame that the media and the mob deserve to carry all on their own.

This is another version of what the media did in 2017 after James Hodgkinson, a Democrat who hated Trump, shot up a baseball field of Republicans, critically injuring Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. In the face of all evidence that Hodgkinson was a left-wing Democrat who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for the 2016 Democratic nomination, and that he was animated to go on a shooting rampage by his own political frustrations, New York Times political reporter Glenn Thrush looked to Trump to assign the blame.

"Any debate about civility in politics begins with Trump," he said at the time on Twitter. "No one has degraded discourse more, while embracing the fringe." Yet whatever "fringe" Trump appealed to, none of them have ever picked up a rifle to gun down multiple members of Congress. That was a Bernie Bro.

In an effort to even the score between the GOP and Democrats, the New York Times editorial board chalked the incident up to "vicious American politics" and repeated the false claim that "the link to political incitement was clear" between 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and the 2011 shooting of then-Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. (The paper later had to remove that part from its editorial, admitting nearly a decade after it happened that there was "no such link.”)

Hodgkinson's Facebook page showed that he belonged to the groups "Terminate the Republican Party" and "The Road to Hell is Paved with Republicans." One note on his Facebook said, "It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co."

But a bemused editorial in the Washington Post asked, "Who knows what mixture of madness and circumstance causes someone to pick up a gun and go on a rampage?" Indeed, who knows?

The paper then helped spread responsibility for the tragedy, saying that it should "cause a gut check about what passes for political discourse in this country."

Hodgkinson was a partisan Democrat. Before his shooting spree, he asked then-Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., as they left the field early, whether it was Republicans or Democrats practicing. He wanted to make sure he was attempting to murder the right people.

And yet a willfully-clueless Scott Pelley of the CBS "Evening News" ended one night’s news program decrying unspecified "leaders and political commentators who set an example" for having "led us into an abyss of violent rhetoric."

When an outspoken Democratic voter opens fire on a group of Republicans practicing baseball, the media blame everyone. Likewise, when a group of high school kids are found out not to have been the instigators in a confrontation with an old man banging his drum in their faces, we should all sit back and reflect on what we’ve become.

Sorry, but no, we shouldn’t. We can justifiably call out who was responsible for this mess. They, the media and the Twitter Left, can sit there and take it, and the rest of us won't take part in the misery they’ve spread.

AUSTRIAN-GERMAN HITS THE ROAD AS SCHNITZEL EXPRESS

Texto completo: Schnitzel Express may look like a food truck, but owner Helmut Heiss prefers the term "moving restaurant."
And for good reason.
The inside of Schnitzel Express looks like a top-of-the-line industrial kitchen. It has a four-burner stove, two deep fryers, two warming stations, a cooler and a grill. Everything is spotless and orderly, evidence that this is the handiwork of a professional chef.
Heiss is best known as the owner of the long-running Austrian-German Restaurant at Royal Palm Square in Fort Myers, which he sold in 2017. He had the truck for the Schnitzel Express custom-built in Orlando last fall. It opened for business in December. He said his decision to launch a food truck was about preserving his sanity.
"After 10 years, it was too much," Heiss said.
"I was by myself, cooking 150 meals in three hours every day. And when you want to make it all fresh, it's very labor-intensive.
"It was such a pressure, and I really had health problems. But now it's all over. I can organize this the way I want, and we are also able to take a break when we need it. In a restaurant you can never take a break, there's always something to do. People ask me why I gave up the restaurant, and I tell them it was a survival mission."
Before Heiss moved to Fort Myers, he was a software developer for a hospital in Vienna. Like many who move to Southwest Florida, he came in search of better weather, of a place that wasn't cold eight months out of the year.
Heiss always loved cooking, and after he settled in Lee County he decided to try his hand at running a restaurant.
"It was a big shift," he said. "A complete change in everything. I was cooking for my life, 16 hours a day."
At the restaurant, Heiss met his wife, Annemarie Heiss, who is originally from Baden-Baden, Germany. They married in 2016, and today they run the Schnitzel Express together.
"He used to leave at 7 in the morning and come back at midnight, but now things are different," Annemarie said.
"It's not 16 hours like at the restaurant," said Heiss. "It's concentrated. From 4 until midnight is much better than 8 o'clock in the morning until midnight."
At Schnitzel Express, customers can choose from a list of five or six rotating specials, which include the wiener schnitzel, the chicken schnitzel and the hunter schnitzel served with mushroom gravy.
Diners can also call ahead a few days in advance and request meals from a more extensive menu.
"When people order something in advance, they can get everything I had in the restaurant," Heiss said. "This is the difference between a food truck with a few variations of items and what I offer. If somebody comes and they say, 'You don't have vegan,' I say, 'I have vegan. I can cook everything.'"
Though many people who stop by Schnitzel Express are familiar with the menu, Heiss has to explain schnitzel to some.
"They think it's a sausage," he said. "Sometimes they cannot explain what it is, but this is an invitation to show people."
He's happy to describe the schnitzel (a piece of thinly pounded meat, coated in bread crumbs and fried), and he considers sharing his heritage part of his job on the Schnitzel Express.
"When we are from Germany and Austria, then we also have to present our culture a little bit along with the meals that we serve here."
The Schnitzel Express makes stops around Lee and Collier County with an emphasis on breweries including Point Ybel in south Fort Myers, Scotty's Bierwerks in Cape Coral and Millennial Brewing in downtown Fort Myers.
Why the breweries?
"German food always fits very good with beer," Heiss said.
"Schnitzel and pork roast are things we like to eat with beer."
At Millennial Brewing, where Schnitzel Express is parked every Tuesday from 3-10 p.m., several of the beers are especially recommended for Heiss' German and Austrian dishes.
"The beer that would go well with this stuff is our Extra Special Bitter or ESB. It's an English beer that's similar to a Vienna lager," Millennial's owner Kyle Cebull said.
"It's smooth and the flavor profile fits well with schnitzel. I'd also say our IPA. It's non-traditional, but IPAs go well with fried food. I love it."
And judging from the lines that form outside this moving restaurant, it's safe to say Heiss' customers love it, too.

Texto completo: Dyson, the British appliances company founded by a vocal supporter of Britain's departure from the European Union, has decided to leave for Singapore.
The company, which makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers and has an electric car in the pipeline, is moving its headquarters from Malmesbury, in southwest England, to Singapore in response to demand for its products in Asia, the company said Tuesday.
"An increasing majority of Dyson's customers and all of our manufacturing operations are now in Asia," the company said in its financial report. "This shift has been occurring for some time and will quicken as Dyson brings its electric vehicle to market." The company said it would also double the size of its technology center in Singapore.
The company insisted the relocation of the headquarters would involve only two job moves: Jorn Jensen, the chief financial officer, and Martin Bowen, the general counsel, will move to Singapore. Over all, the company said, it employs more than 12,000 people around the world, with more than 4,500 in Britain.
A spokeswoman said the move was not a response to Britain's plan to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, or conditions in Britain. "We remain committed to the U.K., but are growing quickly in Asia, too," she said.
Still, that did not stop people on Twitter from suggesting that the move was hypocritical and contradicted claims by James Dyson, the company's founder and chairman, that the country would be better off outside the European Union.
Singapore signed a free-trade agreement with the European Union in October, but Britain's relationship with the bloc remains unclear, as it is still negotiating its departure.
"Dyson's decision to move his HQ to Singapore reflects his narrow business interest," said Sam Gyimah, a Conservative member of Parliament, on Twitter. "Betrayal of the public who put their faith in him as a British business advocating a No Deal Brexit."
Mr. Dyson told The New York Times last year that "Europe is a protectionist setup designed to keep competitors out. It's not a good thing to be in."
"It was the right decision for Britain," he said of the vote to leave.
In a conversation with the BBC about Brexit last year, Mr. Dyson also praised Singapore's ability to change. When asked about how Britain would make money around the world, Mr. Dyson said, "We've got to refocus ourselves, as indeed Singapore did 50 years ago when it split from Malaysia."
The company, which started by making vacuum cleaners, has become a ubiquitous presence across the country, with electric hand dryers adorning the walls of many public bathrooms and air purifiers and hair dryers in many homes.
Mr. Dyson, 71, has lost none of his charm, lending his voice to TV commercials for the company's products. He remains the face of the company and is now one of Britain's richest people, as well as a knight.

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
OTHER VIEWS: ' ‘We still have no evidence of collusion’
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
►There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
►Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
►The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
►Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
►A plank in the GOP platform regarding U. S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
►Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won. " By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U. S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

Texto completo: Recently I have been reminded that there are many strong ethnic communities in Latin America. With so much attention in the media to immigrants in the U.S. from Latin America, the U.S. public should realize that Latin Americans are far from the "cookie cutter" image that prevails today.
In April when Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was sworn in as president of Cuba to end 60 years of rule by the Castro brothers, media reports commented that this historic change would herald more diversity in the Cuban government, namely more positions for women and Afro-Cubans. For instance, a New York Times headline read, "A Transition of Power in Cuba Sends a Signal on Diversity, Too." What does not receive media coverage in the U.S. is the diversity in Latin American countries, which in Cuba and elsewhere go far beyond the cited diversity in the new Cuban government.
Few people realize the extent of Asian immigration into Latin America. While today most big cities in the region have a Chinatown, Cuba used to have the largest Chinese population in Latin America before Fidel Castro took power. Beginning in 1847, Chinese immigrations came to Cuba to work the sugar plantations and this Chinese immigration continued until the 1940s. In 1940, the Chinatown in Havana alone was said to have 40,000 people.
Cubans of Chinese descent were prominent on both sides of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s. In fact, a 2006 book "Our Story Is Still Being Written: The Story of Three Chinese-Cuban Generals in the Cuban Revolution" chronicles the stories of Armando Choy, Gustavo Chiy and Moises Sio Wong, three high-profile generals who helped Fidel Castro gain power and later were prominent in the Cuban military and government for some time.
An overlooked and compelling fact is that Brazil holds the distinction of having the highest ethnic Japanese population outside of Japan as in 2008 it was determined that there were more than 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants in Brazil, primarily in the state of Sao Paolo.
To a lesser degree, Peru and Paraguay have noticeable Japanese communities as first-generation Japanese-Peruvian Alberto Fujimori served as president of Peru from 1990 -2000, all the time while political opponents alleged that he was ineligible to be president, claiming Fujimori was really born in Japa. By far, Argentina has the largest Korean community in Latin American which was estimated at 40,000 in 1990, but has been cut in half in recent years as Argentine economic hardship has forced many Korean-Argentines to leave for the U.S.
Over 60% of the Uruguayan population is of Italian descent, with Italian immigration to the South American nation beginning in the 1870's and continuing until the 1960's. An irony occurred in the 2014 World Cup when Italy was knocked out early by Uruguay. However, the biggest World Cup irony, which was noted in the media, was that in the final round Germany met Argentina, a nation that is famous for its large German population.
Another ethnic group in Argentina that is little known to the outside world is that of the Irish. Large numbers of Irish came to Argentina between 1870 and 1930, giving Argentina the largest Irish population outside of the English-speaking world.
There are also visible Lebanese communities in numerous countries and a multitude of strong Jewish communities throughout the region. With immigration from Latin America being such a major issue in recent years, the U.S. public needs to be aware that the image of the typical Latino should not be of the cookie cutter mold. While Latino immigrants obviously bring diversity to the U.S., people in the U.S. should be aware that there is great diversity within Latino countries and that these ethnic communities only make those countries most interesting places.

We’re well past the point of urging the press to do better. Something is seriously wrong

Texto completo: The news media in the United States is horribly, perhaps irrevocably, broken.

In the past 72 hours, there have been two major, all-consuming news cycles based on either inaccurate or outright false allegations. Almost as distressing as the fact that the press ignored obvious red flags in promoting these stories is that some in the news media continue to cling to the original bogus narratives. Because when it comes to accusations leveled against President Trump and conservatives, the nation’s largest and most powerful newsrooms are less arbiters of truth and more actively hostile culture warriors.

The first major news cycle came Thursday evening after BuzzFeed News published a report titled, “President Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project.”

The press went wild, enthusiastically repeating the story’s central claim, ignoring all the while that it is based entirely on the say-so of two anonymous sources who say they’re familiar with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Newsrooms eagerly parroted the BuzzFeed News article despite its authors contradicting each other over whether they had actually seen proof of the allegation made by their anonymous sources.

The three networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC News, dedicated an impressive 27 minutes Friday to covering the report. The talking heads at CNN and MSNBC used the word “impeach” roughly 200 times Friday morning and afternoon in discussing how they thought the article would play out for the White House. Laughably enough, newsrooms and pundits also referred to the story as a “bombshell” while also leaning heavily on the “if true” qualifier.

Then came Friday evening.

"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate," Mueller's office said in a statement.

Good thing those newsrooms couched their coverage with the ironclad “if true” qualifier.

Absurdly enough, some in the news media maintain that maybe the denial wasn’t even a denial after all. Others are criticizing the Office of Special Counsel for saying anything at all.

More still say the news industry is the real victim of BuzzFeed News' reporting. “Those trying to tar all media today aren’t interested in improving journalism but protecting themselves,” said MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. “There’s a lot more accountability in media these days than in our politics. We know we live in a glass house, we hope the folks we cover are as self aware.”

His self-righteousness would be a lot more persuasive were it not for the fact that we’ve been down this exact same road maybe a dozen times already in the Trump era. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Newsrooms face-plant on a doubtful and thinly sourced Trump administration story, the president and his allies claim vindication in their anti-media crusade, and members of the news media say it’s unfair that people keep pointing out the news industry’s mistakes and that they all seem to go in one direction. This was a much more interesting story back in Trump's first year.

Todd’s claim that the press does a good job holding itself accountable would also be more convincing were it not for the fact that newsrooms were at it again less than 24 hours after the Mueller statement, eagerly propping up an obviously dubious story alleging several white teenagers at the March for Life had harassed Nathan Phillips, an elderly Native American protester. There have been calls for boycotts of the teens’ school. Some of the students seen in the video have also been "doxed" and threatened with physical violence, all based on a single, incomplete video and Phillips' say-so.

“Boys in ‘Make America Great Again’ Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March,” reported the New York Times this weekend.

The Washington Post reported in a headline, “‘It was getting ugly’: Native American drummer speaks on his encounter with MAGA-hat-wearing teens.”

“Viral video of Catholic school teens in 'MAGA' caps taunting Native Americans draws widespread condemnation; prompts a school investigation,” reported ABC News.

The New Republic’s Jeet Heer called the teens in the video “racists.” CNN’s Ana Navarro claimed the teens’ “asswipe” parents had taught them “bigotry” and “racism.” Others uncritically repeated Phillips' charge that the teens had chanted “Build the wall” at him while blocking him from ascending the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

As it turns out, however, more complete footage of the incident tells an entirely different story. The longer tapes are so revealing, in fact, that it seems clear Phillips' account in the Washington Post and elsewhere was deliberately misleading. The teens perhaps did not behave as well as one would hope for, but there is nothing to show that they “mobbed” Phillips — he approached them. There is nothing to corroborate Phillips’ claim they chanted “Build the wall.” In short, there is nothing to show the incident played out the way newsrooms claimed it did.

Several of the media commentators who had originally called for the boys’ destruction have since deleted their initial remarks, which, again, were based solely on a contextless video and the say-so of one person. Others, however, clung to the narrative that racist, white teenagers from a school in Kentucky had tormented a Native American. New York magazine even published a supposed first-hand account Monday, which a Vanity Fair staff writer claims refutes the complete footage of the incident.

All of this because newsrooms were willing to bet everything on one brief, contextless video and the allegation of a single source.

Neither the BuzzFeed story nor the MAGA-teens story should’ve been treated as anything other than thinly sourced allegations requiring a healthy dose of skepticism and further corroboration. But the news media can’t help itself, especially if it sees red.

I’ve spent the last two years urging the press to do better, arguing that every misstep and face-plant feeds the president’s claim that the news media is an unreliable narrator. To a degree, he’s right. If there’s one takeaway from this weekend of clown-shoe news reporting, it’s that a disproportionate number of reporters care more about sticking it to the Right than they care about facts. The press has long been an unabashedly political machine, its many members leaning hard to the Left. But this weekend signals that things have gone far beyond politics. It's straight-up culture war now in the nation's media, all of it catering to the lowest, meanest common denominator.

Don't expect the reporting to get better. So long as this industry continues its downward spiral into the supremely partisan, with reporters chasing blindly after wins for their respective teams, the reporting is only going to get worse. Much worse.

Smith: It won’t be easy deciding who will get Dave Lewis’ model train town

Texto completo: Our story Monday about the model train landscape that traces creator Dave Lewis’ 50 years with his wife, Suzan, ended with the surprise that the Windsor couple wants to give the Old Town layout away.
Dave and Suzan wondered if anyone would want it. People do.
Today the couple weighs several requests. Two parties eager to take the layout told of losing their train landscapes to the 2017 fires.
A man shared that he and his wife wanted to build just such a stroll-down-memory-lane train set, but she died last year.
It turns out that giving away Old Town will be tougher than Dave and Suzan thought.

MATURE AUDIENCE: The laughs started early at Lewis Black’s show Sunday night at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts.
Fans of the expletive-loving comic able to read small print noticed this on the ticket: NO CHILDREN UNDER 5.
Would you imagine that many parents take 6- and 7-year-olds to see Lewis Black?
There was an adolescent or two at the LBC on Sunday night. I didn’t notice anyone checking IDs to make certain they were born on or before Jan. 20, 2014.
Black, by the way, seemed genuinely gleeful to be back here. He spoke of how special this area and the LBC are to him, and how dear they were to the late George Carlin.
Maybe you’ll recall that Carlin shot “It’s Bad for Ya,” his 14th and final HBO special, at the LBC — then the Wells Fargo Center — in March 2008. Less than four months later he died from heart failure at age 71.
At Sunday’s show Black, who’s 70, praised the LBC as “one of the greatest, if not the greatest, large comedy venues in the country.”

TOM HANKS’ FACE owes much to Santa Rosa native and two-time Oscar nominee Dan Striepeke.
Through 17 films, Hanks’ countenance was made camera-ready by Striepeke, the brother of late Sonoma County Sheriff Don Striepeke and one of Hollywood’s most acclaimed makeup artists.
Dan Striepeke, who got his start in theater at Santa Rosa High School in the late 1940s, died Saturday in Southern California of heart trouble at 88.
A second brother, Santa Rosa’s Ed Striepeke, recalls that Dan took his makeup kit with him when, not long after high school, he left Sonoma County for a trip to Mexico.
“On the way back,” Ed Striepeke said, “he went to Los Angeles and that’s where he stayed. At 19, he got his first job, on KTTV.”
Dan Striepeke went on to create makeup magic on scores of films: Around the World in 80 Days, The Sound of Music, Spartacus, Planet of the Apes, The Magnificent Seven, Viva Las Vegas, Patton, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
He became head of the makeup department at Twentieth Century Fox, and then Tom Hanks’ exclusive makeup artist.
Hanks wrote in a 2006 New York Times piece, “The Man Who Aged Me,” that Striepeke was a true artist and friend who, in the making of Forrest Gump, worked with him for 27 straight days and “took me from a teenager to a Vietnam soldier to parenthood as Sally Field died of cancer, earning him and his team one of Gump’s Academy Award nominations.

Texto completo: "Without presenting any evidence, President Trump said ... ." This is how the media covers the Trump administration, with additional commentary accusing him of lying.
The New York Times on Jan. 11 published a piece about the FBI's inquiry into the possibility that Trump was working on behalf of Russia. Subsequent stories have been published. Despite The New York Times not presenting any evidence, it is praised for publishing a "bombshell" report that is causing additional Russia hysteria.
The only evidence presented was the last paragraph: "No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. An FBI spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel's office both declined to comment."
If The New York Times was consistent in its reporting, the Russia "bombshell" article would have begun with "Without any evidence, we're accusing Trump of being a Russian agent."

Texto completo: Theodore Roosevelt died 100 years ago, on Jan. 6, 1919, at his home in Oyster Bay, N.Y. A pulmonary embolism, the doctors said. Few Americans know that their most physically vigorous president was also the first major American political figure to advocate passionately for national health insurance.
President Roosevelt won passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act. He succeeded by seizing on public outrage over a best-selling novel, "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair, which had exposed the stomach-turning conditions in Chicago's meatpacking plants. Signed on the same day in 1906, the laws were milestones in health and in federal regulation of business for the public good.
As president, Roosevelt was aware that the governments of Germany, France and Britain had set up programs to help their citizens stave off the financial catastrophes associated with old age, illness, injury, unemployment and loss of a breadwinner. He was embarrassed that the United States had nothing comparable. The idea of using the government's strength to assist those unable to fend for themselves seemed to him a mark of national greatness.
Roosevelt issued dozens of executive orders creating federal wildlife refuges on public land, a move that protected animals and reduced pollution. He also made liberal use of presidential commissions. The Inland Waterways Commission was established in 1907 to manage the nation's lakes and rivers and to develop their potential as a transportation network. The ostensible goals were economic, but the plan also called for flood control, soil reclamation and pollution abatement - all boons to public health.
Toward the end of his presidency, Roosevelt appointed a White House commission to study the problems of rural life. Among the chief topics of the group's report was the poor state of health in the hinterlands.
In 1908, he hosted a conference of governors, focused on conservation, and nearly every governor present went home and formed a state conservation commission. There may be no better way for the country to honor his memory than to get off its duff and persevere until all Americans have decent health care.
Patricia O'Toole is the author of several biographies, including "The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made" and "When Trumpets Call: Theodore Roosevelt After the White House." This is an excerpt from an essay that first apppeared in The New York Times.

Senator Harris raising, softening her profile

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Kamala Harris leaned toward the microphone last week and looked at William Barr, President Trump's nominee for attorney general. The questions flew fast. Was he advocating for a border wall? Did he know most illegal drugs come through ports of entry? Had he been to one lately?
When Barr said he had not, Harris pointedly suggested he do so.
This is the Harris most Americans know, if they know the California Democrat: the calm, focused inquisitor on the dais of the Senate Judiciary Committee, directing withering questions at such Trump appointees as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or former attorney general Jeff Sessions (who once said her volley of queries made him feel “rushed" and “nervous").
But in recent weeks, amid wide speculation she plans to run for president, Harris has taken to cozier forums, including a multicity book tour in stately theaters and a scheduled Monday appearance on TV's “Good Morning America," to unfold a more conciliatory political message.
“We have so much more in common than what separates us as a people, especially after November 2016," Harris said during a recent book event in New York City, referring to the night Trump was elected president — and she was elected to the Senate.
Her rise in national politics has come quickly, and she is working hard to introduce herself to the more than half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, according to one recent poll, who have not heard of her (or are unsure how they view her). But if she runs, Harris is expected to instantly be considered a top-tier candidate, and her potential competitors — including Elizabeth Warren — are likely to eye her carefully.
Harris would “naturally attract a lot of buzz out of the gate," said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Hillary Clinton. But if she runs, he added, “at that point there will need to be more articulation of what she's running for and what her agenda will look like."
While other potential candidates have already made appearances in early primary and caucus states, Harris has offered a broad political message and focused on presenting herself as an enlightened former prosecutor and the daughter of immigrants — one from India and one from Jamaica — who has already made history as the second black woman elected to the Senate (and the first South-Asian American). She has won plaudits from Democrats for her willingness to oppose Trump.
“Look, political capital doesn't gain interest," she said at the New York event, recalling a phrase she instilled in her team while she was a prosecutor — and a possible hint of her plans. “So don't let it sit there. Spend it."
Harris is a relatively fresh face in national politics who has not faced stiff Republican opposition in a race since she was first elected California attorney general in 2010.
She is beginning to face more scrutiny, as when a New York Times op-ed last week argued her record as a prosecutor is not as progressive as she has made it out to be — a line of criticism that may grow in a party turning to the left on criminal justice.
“She is untested, and that's not a criticism — that's just the reality," said Darry Sragow, a political strategist in California. “I don't think anybody knows, including Kamala Harris, how it's going to work out."
Still, some Democratic groups and operatives are deeply intrigued by the prospect of Harris taking on Trump.
“We have the most divisive politician as president of the United States, and Senator Harris is the antithesis of that, its opposite, both in her policy outlook and her biography," said Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, who has known Harris since she was attorney general.
With her new book, “The Truths We Hold," Harris is telling this story.
Born in Oakland, Calif., in 1964, Harris grew up mostly in the care of her mother, Shyamala, a breast-cancer researcher. (Her sister Maya became a senior adviser to Clinton during her 2016 campaign.)
Harris was wheeled to civil rights marches in her stroller and decided early in life that she wanted to become a lawyer.
She attended Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, and became a prosecutor — a choice she says was driven by a desire to reform the system. “When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in," Harris wrote.
Harris was elected district attorney for San Francisco in 2003 and ran for attorney general in 2010, winning a close race in which the Republican State Leadership Committee spent $1 million trying to defeat her.
During the New York book talk, Harris spoke warmly with a friendly moderator, moving easily between political platitudes — “Anything worth fighting for is a fight worth having," she said — and a spot-on impression of her New Jersey in-laws that drew peals of laughter from the crowd.
“She's a real human, and someone who talks about the truth in a way that I can resonate with," said Alison Fetten, 48, a newly elected member of the borough council in South Bound Brook, N.J., who watched the talk and said Harris was at the top of her list of presidential contenders.
Harris drew heavily on her work as a prosecutor. Asked about Trump's border wall, she spoke of dealing with transnational criminals: “The wall ain't gonna stop them!"
She has also touted a settlement she helped to secure from big banks that brought $20 billion in homeowner relief for Californians after the foreclosure crisis and emphasized her work on prison reentry initiatives, bail reform, and other pillars of criminal justice reform.
But some critics say Harris is painting an overly rosy picture of her time as prosecutor. A review in the Atlantic, for example, said her book “doesn't meaningfully reconcile her punitive track record as a California prosecutor with her more recent activist-adjacent positioning as a national Democratic darling."
Her spokeswoman, Lily Adams, said in a statement that Harris pushed for police accountability during her career and diverted young people to apprenticeship programs instead of prison.
“Kamala Harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system," Adams said.
Harris is a formidable fund-raiser with a huge social-media following; online clips of her in Judiciary Committee hearings have been viewed millions of times.
She may also appeal to voters looking for a standard-bearer who embodies the party's diversity.
“The heart and soul of the Democratic Party today, and going into 2020, is fueled by women and candidates of color," said Mary Anne Marsh, a political strategist based in Boston.
That means the early primary map could be favorable to Harris, particularly if she connects with voters in her home state of California — which will vote much earlier than usual in 2020 — and with black voters in the southern states that helped power Clinton to a primary victory over Bernie Sanders in 2016.
But other likely candidates will be working hard to win over those same voters. Warren, who is among the potential candidates already hiring staff in key primary states, frequently mentions the role of racial discrimination in holding back people of color in her stump speech.
“I think Warren is very clearly showing that she understands the need to appeal to many of the same voters among whom Harris will have a quite natural appeal," Fallon said.
Warren and Harris may hit on similar themes about holding the powerful to account, since both are lawyers who have taken on corporate interests. (Warren, however, has built a reputation as more of an economic progressive.)
And both have been famously interrupted in the Senate, which rallied women to their sides. The phrase “Nevertheless, she persisted" originated when Warren was cut off by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell in 2017. And Warren herself tweeted the phrase in support of Harris when she, too, was interrupted by Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr while questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Harris nodded to the phrase again in her book, when she recalled meeting with Warren while she was attorney general and Warren was developing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Harris told Warren she was not ready to sign on to any foreclosure settlement that would prevent her from doing her own investigation.
“As an administration official, she couldn't outright tell us to go our own way, but I got the strong sense she would understand if I persisted," Harris wrote.

THE PA. GRAND JURY REPORT IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS THE DOCUMENT IS INACCURATE, UNFAIR AND MISLEADING, ARGUES COMMONWEALTH'S PETER STEINFELS

Texto completo: August 15 is the Feast of the Assumption, a "holy day of obligation," when Catholics are expected to attend Mass. This year millions of Catholics went to church sick at heart. I was among them.
The day before, the attorney general of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had released a grand-jury report declaring that hundreds of Catholic priests had sexually abused minors. The grand jury's conclusions were summarized in reports that landed on the front pages of the New York Times and other newspapers around the world, as well as lead stories on all sorts of television news programs. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro spoke on "Today" and nightly news broadcasts. No Catholics serious about their faith, indeed no one of any sensitivity, could have read about the report without feeling horror and shame. And anger. It was bad enough to read graphic accounts of anal and oral rape, sometimes combined with sacrilegious perversities; it was doubly appalling to be told that church leaders had systematically covered up these crimes and allowed abusers to go unchecked.
Within hours, the Pennsylvania grand-jury report was propelled to international status. The Vatican expressed "shame and sorrow." Adjectives piled up from Catholic and secular sources: abominable, revolting, reprehensible, nauseating, diabolical. The New York Times editorialized on "The Catholic Church's Unholy Stain."
Months have passed but the report's impact has not. At least a dozen states have announced they would follow Pennsylvania in conducting their own investigations (Illinois issued a preliminary report in December); the Justice Department has suggested that it, too, might get into the act. Pope Francis has called for bishops from around the world to address the sex-abuse scandal at the Vatican in February, where the Pennsylvania report will undoubtedly be a chief exhibit-as it currently is for Catholics both on the right and the left writing farewells to the church.
In fact, the report makes not one but two distinct charges. The first one concerns predator priests, their many victims and their unspeakable acts. That charge is, as far as can be determined, dreadfully true. Appalling as is this first charge, it is in fact the second one that has had the greatest reverberations. "All" of these victims, the report declares, "were brushed aside, in every part of the state, by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institutions above all." Or as the introduction to the report sums it up, "Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all."
What now?
As of this writing, a dozen or more states and the federal government are signaling intentions to follow Pennsylvania's lead in investigating clergy sex abuse in the Catholic church. Just before leaving office, the attorney general of Illinois specifically cited the Pennsylvania model (and duplicated some of its faults) in a preliminary headline-grabbing report. It is possible that these investigations could be productive and salutary. But only if they make distinctions between dioceses, leaders and time frames. Only if they recognize changes over time in the larger society's understanding and openness about sexual abuse. Only if they provide perspective by comparisons with other institutions. Only if they engage honestly with diverse or contrary viewpoints, including those of church officials. Only if they are written in a way that expresses necessary, justifiable repulsion toward crimes against children and young people without burying all efforts at analysis in a mudslide of outrage.
Only, in short, if they do better than Pennsylvania.
That is for the future. For the present, the important thing is to restore some fact-based reality to the instant mythology that the Pennsylvania report has created.
A need for investigation
What does the report document? It documents decades of stomach-churning violations of the physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity of children and young people. It documents that many of these atrocities could have been prevented by promptly removing the credibly suspected perpetrators from all priestly roles and ministry. It documents that some, although far from all, of those failures were due to an overriding concern for protecting the reputation of the church and the clergy and a reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of children. It also documents that a good portion of these crimes, perhaps a third or more, only came to the knowledge of church authorities in 2002 or after, when the Dallas Charter mandated automatic removal from ministry. It documents, well before 2002, many conscientious attempts to determine the truth of accusations and prevent any further abuse, often successful though sometimes poorly executed or tragically misinformed. It documents significant differences between dioceses and bishops and time periods in the response to allegations of abuse. It documents major changes in vigilance and response in some dioceses during the 1990s and, as far as the evidence shows, dramatic changes after 2002.
What does the report not document? It does not document the sensational charges contained in its introduction - namely, that over seven decades Catholic authorities, in virtual lockstep, supposedly brushed aside all victims and did absolutely nothing in the face of terrible crimes against boys and girls-except to conceal them. This ugly, indiscriminate, and inflammatory charge, unsubstantiated by the report's own evidence, to say nothing of the evidence the report ignores, is truly unworthy of a judicial body responsible for impartial justice.
Why the media were so amenable to uncritically echoing this story without investigation, and why Catholics in particular were so eager to seize on it to settle their internal differences, are important topics for further discussion.
It is true that disturbing instances of apparent failures by church officials continue to come to light-and will no doubt continue to do so, especially as the line between past cases and current ones is regularly blurred, and as cases from all around the world are increasingly blended with a few American ones into a single narrative. Church leaders must remove persistent doubts that these failures are being thoroughly investigated, with consequences for those found responsible.
Moving forward
Doing that will not be easy. The prevalent story about Catholic clergy sex abuse as deeply entrenched, largely unabated, and uniquely Catholic is now so embedded in the media as to make it resistant to evidence to the contrary, which, at least for the United States, is ample and well-documented.
In the case of Pennsylvania, whether one looks at the handling of old allegations or the prevention of new ones, the conclusion that a careful, unbiased reading of the Pennsylvania report compels is this: the Dallas Charter has worked. Not worked perfectly, not without need for regular improvements and constant watchfulness. But worked. Justified alarm and demands for accountability at instances of either deliberate noncompliance or bureaucratic incompetence should not be wrenched into an ill-founded pretense that, fundamentally, nothing has changed.
This conclusion does not acquit the Catholic hierarchy of all sins, past or present. Personally I have a substantial list. Nor is it impossible that some other states may vary from Pennsylvania. But just as the grand-jury report correctly though not consistently points to "institutional failure," something beyond the virtues and vices of individual leaders, the Dallas Charter has apparently proved to be an institutional success. It set out, and has regularly fine-tuned, procedures, practices, and standards that can be overseen by middling caretaker leaders as well as outstanding, proactive ones.
The Dallas Charter is decidedly not a recipe that can simply be transferred to any society or culture or legal and governmental situation around the globe. But American bishops should go to the Vatican's February summit meeting on sexual abuse confident that the measures they've already adopted have made an important difference.

Texto completo: Having been born in the ’90s doesn’t stop Christopher Renalds from loving the music of the ’80s.
Singing Pat Benatar’s 1980 classic, “Hit Me With Your Best Shot,” never gets old for the musical theater enthusiast, who’s starring in the touring production of the Broadway musical “Rock of Ages.” The 2009 musical spawned the 2012 eponymous film that starred Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand and Julianne Hough. The show will stop by the Pikes Peak Center on Tuesday.
“The music of the ’80s is both so rough and so fun,” Renalds said from a tour stop in Charleston, S.C. “Nostalgia is so important to who we are as people. There are so many (theater) pieces challenging your perspective, but let’s remember that crazy, wild, profane time of the mid- to late ’80s. Nobody dresses like Bret Michaels anymore, and they probably shouldn’t, but it’s OK to look back at how funny it was.”
It’s the 10th anniversary of the musical that pays homage to classic ’80s rock music, with songs by glam-metal bands Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Twisted Sister, Poison and others. The story tracks three Hollywood musicians: Sherrie, an aspiring young actress from the Midwest, who arrives in town with a thirst for the spotlight; Drew, a wannabe rock star, who falls in love with her; and Stacee Jaxx, a hot rock star at the pinnacle of his career. Life seems rich with opportunity for the three, until a real estate developer arrives and want to transform the Sunset Strip into a strip mall.
“But in These Straitened Economic Times the allure of nostalgia cannot be underestimated. ‘Rock of Ages’ does not aspire to be a Broadway musical for the ages, but for anyone whose youth coincided with the time period in question, the siren call of those screaming guitars and singalong choruses may be impossible to resist,” critic Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times in 2009.
Renalds plays Franz, son of the real estate developer who tries to wreak havoc on the Strip. He made his musical theater debut in “The Music Man” as a pre-teen. He loved everything about it. In high school, he realized it was his calling, which threw his Silicon Valley parents off-kilter. They hoped he’d be a lawyer, a far cry from his passion, but they ponied up support for his choice.
After earning a bachelor’s in musical theater from Emerson College in Boston, he moved to New York City. Along the way he spent almost two years working for Disney Cruise Line and portrayed the characters Peter Pan and Quasimodo. He also developed a stellar “princess whistle,” which is listed on his resume under special talents.
“It was kind of a joke,” he said. “I have an acting coach who said, ‘You should have a conversation piece to put on your resume to open the door.’ I’ll do an audition, and they’ll say: ‘Princess whistle?’ I say, ‘Name the princess.’ They say Ariel, and I say OK and start whistling ‘Part of Your World.’”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Some people who tuned in to watch President Donald Trump's proposal on Saturday to end the 28-day government shutdown took issue with one particular line of the 13-minute address.
The president proposed a compromise: the $5. 7 billion to build a wall along the southern border for temporary protections for undocumented immigrants, including children. He called the proposal "a common-sense compromise both parties can embrace. "
"To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5. 7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall," Trump said. "This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. "
Those at home took notice that Trump seemed to downplay the scope of his wall plan, which he has boasted about during campaign rallies. Many also noted the very public way Trump noted that the wall would not be made of concrete as he had said and wouldn't extend the full length of the border.
From concrete wall to steel fences: A timeline of Trump's evolving border barrier concept
"Not sea to sea, not paid for by Mexico, only steel slats. #Trump is walking back more than Michael Jackson," one Twitter user said after the speech.
Another chimed in, saying the president "finally acknowledged that the wall will not be from sea to sea or 1954 miles, because it is would be physically impossible given the terrain. The right will not be happy. "
Trump's proposal also drew criticism from some hard-line conservatives, who argued it would encourage more illegal immigration.
"A Big Beautiful Concrete Border Wall will be a monument to the Rule of Law, the sovereignty of the USA, & @RealDonaldTrump," Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, wrote on Twitter. "If DACA Amnesty is traded for $5. 7 billion(1/5 of a wall), wouldn’t be enough illegals left in America to trade for the remaining 4/5. NO AMNESTY 4 a wall!"
Conservative commentator Ann Coulter accused Trump of proposing "amnesty" for undocumented immigrants.
"100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals," she tweeted. "So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall. "
While the president's comments have changed significantly when it comes to what the wall will be made of and how much it will cost, Trump and his Cabinet have said multiple times that a wall would not stretch the entire length of the U. S. -Mexico border, which extends about 1,933 miles.
A look at Trump's "evolving" remarks on his proposed border wall shows that as far back as 2015, the president called for a wall extending 1,000 miles, or about half the length of the border.
"As far as the wall is concerned, we’re going to build a wall. We’re going to create a border. We’re going to let people in, but they’re going to come in legally. They’re going to come in legally," Trump said at a presidential debate in 2015, according to The Times. "And it’s something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the Great Wall of China. That’s 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000. "
Already, 34 percent of the border has a wall or fence, about 654 miles. But other areas of the border without fencing would be difficult to enclose because of the Rio Grande and private property, which the government would have to seize, setting up years of legal challenges.

Gillette ad condemns men who deserve some credit

Texto completo: When I viewed Gillette's "toxic masculinity" TV ad — the one that portrays a line of men shrugging, "Boys will be boys," while their fellows bully the weak, help themselves to unwanted sexual contact, and shut up their female colleagues at work — my first, admittedly tongue-in-cheek thought was: how clever.
Let's see, I reasoned: Gillette's specialty is shaving equipment, and ever increasing numbers of men, especially beard-crazy millennials, aren't shaving these days. Gillette is simply repositioning itself from a marketer to men into a marketer to women.
And what sells better to women than male-bashing? From "doofus Dad" commercials hawking laundry detergent, to a #MeToo movement that mushroomed overnight from allegations of sexual exploitation in the entertainment industry to complaints about bad dates with guys with crude foreplay skills, women make a ready audience for material that tells them that there's something fundamentally wrong — maybe it's patriarchal cultural conditioning — with the other half of the human race.
New York Times best-selling author Jessica Valenti writes: "It's true that women are fed up with sexual violence and harassment; but it's also true that what this culture considers 'normal' sexual behavior is often harmful to women, and that we want that to stop, too." In other words, normal maleness is bad and needs to be changed — and that's why Jessica Valenti is a New York Times best-selling author.
Gillette's male-bashing ploy as marketing There is some irony here. A leading study involving 8,520 women published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology in 2016 suggests that men are growing facial hair, and eschewing shaving, because women like it that way. The study concludes that women prefer men with beards because they view beards — from stubble to the full-blown thing — "as a signal of intrasexual formidability," that is, of being tough and aggressive and masculine, which women view as valuable traits for protecting themselves and their children.
In short, women may say masculinity is toxic, but they go for toxic every time. You might conclude that Gillette, by invoking every cliché in the male-bashing handbook, lets women have their masculinity cake and eat it, too — and also pick up one of Gillette's Venus line of razors for females while they're at it.
That was my tongue-in-cheek take on the ad. Now for my serious take. Many people might ask: What's wrong with telling men not to bully each other or harass women? After all, males commit the overwhelming majority of violent crimes — a byproduct of the physical aggressiveness that goes with testosterone.
Men deserve more credit than Gillette gives The problem with the Gillette ad isn't that it points out that males commit antisocial acts. It's its blithe assumption that other males routinely let them get away with it. This is what has infuriated hundreds of thousands of men to the point of threatening to boycott Gillette. They rightfully point out that supposedly patriarchal Western culture (which, by the way, treats women more respectfully than any other culture humans have ever invented) doesn't "normalize" male acts that harm others, but, rather, quite the opposite. Men might say "boys will be boys" when their son breaks a lamp playing fetch with the dog in the living room. They don't say it when their son joins a gang that beats up other boys in the schoolyard. This is not to say such activity, along with its adult equivalents, isn't uncommon, or that there isn't often peer pressure for men, especially young men, to misbehave. But men have devised institutions — called civilization — designed to channel male aggression in positive directions, such as heroism that saves lives or hard work that supports families. They deserve credit for that.
One of those institutions is fatherhood. It's fathers who are chiefly responsible for turning young male barbarians into gentlemen instead of rapists, boors and bullies. Right now, one out of every four boys in America grows up in a home without a father and pays a price in the well-documented social disorder that has ensued. If Gillette wants to get into the preaching business, it might want to focus on that problem instead of tarring men in general as violence-enablers in need of re-education and their very masculinity as a kind of poison.

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: They've seen the movie, and now they're reading the original "Bird Box" book.
The 2014 novel by Ferndale author/musician Josh Malerman has landed for the first time on the New York Times best-seller list, thanks to the overwhelming success of the Sandra Bullock-starring horror movie from Netflix.
It ranks fourth for combined print and e-book fiction — and it's on the rise. Last week, it debuted at seventh place.
The novel also bumped former First Lady Michelle Obama's memoir "Becoming" from the top of the Apple books list. As of Thursday, "Bird Box" was at No. 1, with "Becoming" in second place.
For a book that debuted modestly five years ago, it's the publishing world equivalent of going viral (just like "Bird Box" memes and jokes have).
Ecco, a division of HarperCollins, is doing numerous additional printings of the book that will have wide distribution.
"We're thrilled to see a great book getting into the hands of so many readers!," said Ecco associate publisher Miriam Parker via email. "It's always a joy when a book finds a new audience"
"Bird Box" received good reviews when it initially came out. Malerman's spare, powerful writing style and pacing drew comparisons to the stylish chills of director Alfred Hitchcock.
Kirkus named it one of the best fiction books of 2014 and said Malerman "keeps us tinglingly on edge with his cool, merciless storytelling."
Publishers Weekly raved that "the author uses understatement and allusion to create a lean, spellbinding thriller that Stephen King fans will relish."
Hollywood recognized the book's potential before it even reached stores. Universal optioned the film rights in 2013, with Netflix eventually buying them for the film adaptation directed by Susanne Bier.
With a screenplay by Eric Heisserer, the movie follows the same structure as the book, but changes the location from the Detroit suburbs to northern California and compresses the action for the two-hour running time.
Even if you've seen the movie, the novel makes for a gripping read. It goes much deeper into the details of what life is like for a group of strangers who hide inside a house after the world is gripped by a mysterious presence that kills you when you look at it.
And because what you can only imagine is always scarier than what you see, the book ratchets up the tension beyond the film's scares — all while maintaining a crisp, clean writing style and taking a perceptive look at the human psyche stretched to the limits.
Malerman wrote the first draft in 2006. Back then it was twice as long as the final version and had many more characters. But the essentials — the blindfolds, the deadly presence that kills when you look at it, the alternating time periods between Malorie hiding in the house and her taking the children on the dangerous river trip — were the same.
He starting rewriting in roughly 2010 and got a publisher, HarperCollins, about two years later.
Malerman was driving home from the Upper Peninsula when his agent called and told him "Bird Box" had made the New York Times best-seller list. "She screamed with excitement and I probably did the same and all I can say is, I'm so glad I was in a traffic stop when I got the news. It was absolutely electrifying," he told Variety.
Long before the film adaptation came out, Malerman saw how audiences responded to the drama of the book's narrative.
When "Bird Box" initially reached book stores, Malerman and his fiancee, Allison Laakko, did some readings where audiences were blindfolded. Laako would play Malorie, while he provided eerie music with a keyboard.
"It was really a magical moment for us because we (founded) a theater troupe almost," he told the Free Press last month.
Malerman is currently busy with more than just the "Bird Box" buzz. His band, the High Strung (known for the theme song to Showtime's "Shameless") is celebrating its new album, "Quiet Riots."
On April 23, his latest novel, "Inspection," is coming out. It involves the mysteries and secrets of two isolated schools for geniuses, one for girls and one for boys.
And for the first time, Malerman can now be promoted as a New York Times best-selling author.

Texto completo: The late afternoon sunlight in Western Australia's Margaret River region is deeply golden, casting its buttery hue across vineyards and filtering through the forests of giant karri trees. Sometimes the landscape looks almost European, with roads tunneled by groves of old trees next to fields of baled hay. Then you spot a herd of Western Gray kangaroos lounging beneath the trees, or turn a bend in the road and there it is: the shocking aqua blue of the Indian Ocean.
It's not hard to see the appeal. But given its remoteness, it is somewhat surprising that the area to the south of Perth, Western Australia's capital city, has become a popular destination for food and wine tourists.
There is no doubt that the region has all the elements needed to draw hungry (and thirsty) tourists. It is stunningly beautiful, and while it is one of the youngest established wine regions in the world (at around 50 years old) it is quite robust, with close to 100 wineries. But it is hardly the only naturally stunning wine-producing region in Australia, and many are older and easier to access. And yet tourism to Margaret River and the surrounding area has exploded, with the number of international visitors up by 37 percent in just the last three years.
How did they do it?
Australia has tilted its tourism strategy toward culinary offerings, not just its cute and fuzzy animal population. Central to the tourist boom in Western Australia is the Margaret River Gourmet Escape, a major food and wine festival.
But first, how remote is it?
Imagine a third of the contiguous United States -- let's say everything west of the Rockies -- as one single state. That is approximately the size of Western Australia, which takes up just under a million square miles of the country's 2,941,300-square-mile area. Now imagine that the entire vast expanse is populated by less than three million people, with more than half of those people living in one city.
Perth is already one of the most remote state capitals in the world, a five-hour flight from Sydney or Singapore (there are no direct flights from the U.S.). Margaret River, the small town that anchors the wine region of the same name, is another three-hour drive from Perth.
How did the festival end up there?
A decade ago, Perth was in the midst of a mining boom, and its hotel rooms were filled almost to capacity. State tourism officials were looking for a way to get visitors to travel beyond the capital city. At the same time, Brand Events -- best known for its "Taste of" festivals in various cities -- was searching globally for a location for its next big food festival. (Brand Events has since been acquired by IMG, a worldwide sports, fashion and events company.)
The Margaret River Gourmet Escape was launched in 2011 and has returned to the region every November since, drawing more that 20,000 attendees in 2018. The festival, which has events spread across the region, consists of wine dinners, parties, book signings and a central "gourmet village" at one of the major wineries, with a main stage for cooking demonstrations and talks.
One of the festival's keys to success has been its ability to draw top-tier talent, and chefs come from around the world to participate. In 2018, Nigella Lawson was the headliner of the Gourmet Escape, all the while sharing dreamy photos of the event with her 1.4 million Instagram followers.
The 2018 festival pretty much looked like this: Ms. Lawson in a long flowing dress on a beach at sunset, toasting a crowd of tipsy revelers. The water was calm and almost electric blue, the beach was adorned with huge canvas tents with lounging areas, waiters carried platters of grilled prawns and pretty cocktails, and strings of twinkling lights made everyone seem a little more attractive than they really are.
Tickets for events are sold separately, and accommodation in the area can be pricey, particularly during the festival; attending is an expensive endeavor, even before you've factored in the travel involved. But the yearly gathering of media, chefs and moneyed food obsessives has helped to boost the profile of Margaret River exponentially.
What's there besides the festival?
The Margaret River winegrowing region is surrounded by state forests and national parks, and outdoor activities are practically limitless. Along the coastline, the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park stretches from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin, and the 76-mile Cape to Cape Track is a bucket-list trail for many Australian hikers. Hugging the coastline and with near constant views of the Indian Ocean, the trail takes between four and eight days to hike, depending on how you go about it.
Most hikers go old-school, packing their own food and stopping to camp wherever they find space. But there are companies that will guide you and arrange transportation, accommodation and food, and high-end hotels, spas and restaurants are just off the track. One company, Walk Into Luxury, offers guided tours with daily transport to and from the trail, gourmet meals and accommodation at Injidup Spa Retreat, where villas with personal spa pools overlook the ocean.
Hotels?
Injidup has one of the most dramatic settings of any Margaret River accommodation option, but it is hardly alone in the ultraluxury hotel game. Farther north along the Cape to Cape Track is Smiths Beach Resort, which looks out over a well-known surf beach and offers everything from two-room cabins to four-bedroom beach houses. Inland, Forest Rise Chalets has free-standing cabins that are nestled into a fairyland-like forest, where kangaroos lope through the trees right in front of your bedroom window. There are also many glamping companies in the area.
Budget options are plentiful, as well. Campsites abound, including in the region's many national parks. Just a little way up the coast from the luxe Smiths Beach Resort is Yallingup Beach Holiday Park, where cabins rent for as little as 90 Australian dollars per night, or about $63, and campsites are even cheaper. The town of Margaret River is home to a host of cheerful motels with reasonable rates.
And what about restaurants?
Margaret River's restaurant scene is also experiencing a boom, much of it hand in hand with the wine industry, as vineyards learn that the dining room can be as much of a draw as the cellar. Two of the region's best-known wineries, Vasse Felix and Cullen Wines, are also home to two of the state's most highly awarded restaurants.
But there are wonderfully unexpected finds as well, including Miki's Open Kitchen, a high-end tempura restaurant in a former beauty parlor in the back of a shopping strip on Margaret River's main street. The chef, Mikihito Nagai, has lived in Western Australia for 22 years, and was drawn to Margaret River 12 years ago in part because it's a great place to surf. In 2013, with tourism on the rise, he saw an opportunity to open something the region hadn't seen before, and Miki's Open Kitchen was born.
These days, Perth's hotel rooms aren't quite as full as they were a decade ago. Western Australia's tourism board and IMG are both looking for ways to expand the success of the Gourmet Escape, and shine light on other areas of the state. In 2019, the festival will expand from four to 10 days, and events will take place in Perth, Margaret River and the Swan Valley, a winegrowing region just northeast of Perth.
Whether they'll find the same success in other parts of the state remains to be seen. Margaret River owes a lot to the Gourmet Escape, but its newfound popularity is undoubtedly mostly thanks to that light, those trees and that astonishing ocean.

500-plus at Women's March in Geneva [Corrected 01/21/2019]

Texto completo: Despite a snowstorm and low temperatures, a crowd of more than 500 flooded downtown Geneva on Saturday at the first Women's March in this small western suburb that boasted prominent speakers like newly elected U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood and Sean Casten.
"Thank you for braving the cold but more importantly for all that you have done in these last two years, and it started with marching," Underwood told the sea of supporters.
"Look at where we are now," she said to applause. "We are stronger and more represented than ever before in Congress."
The inaugural Fox Valley Women's March was organized following recent news that this year there'd be no Chicago march, an event that in previous years drew hundreds of thousands of supporters to Grant Park. In contrast, the turnout at a last-minute Women's March rally downtown this year was a little over 200.
The shift comes as controversy and divisions embroil the larger movement, with leaders of the national group Women's March Inc. facing mounting accusations of anti-Semitism.
Women's March Chicago recently announced it wouldn't host its annual march and rally at Grant Park this year, citing costs and limited volunteer resources so soon after coordinating a similar event in October. While organizers say they have no affiliation with the national group Women's March Inc. and the decision was independent of the recent strife, the opportunity to further distance themselves was considered a "side benefit."
Instead, the local group urged supporters to craft their own community-based marches, political actions or service projects, an initiative dubbed "operation activation."
The result was dozens of anniversary events scattered across the region. An organization in west suburban Brookfield held an event making Valentine's Day cards for the upcoming Brookfield Senior Social. The Downtown Islamic Center organized a talk called "Stories of Woman Strong!" Volunteers on the South Side of the city coordinated snow shoveling to help those in need.
But some women expressed disappointment at the lack of a unified march in Grant Park.
To fill the void, college student Jazmine-Marie Cruz announced this month that she was organizing an event dubbed "Young Women's March Rally 2019" at Federal Plaza.
She said her rally was in alignment with Women's March Inc., and its leaders helped her coordinate it; she's said she hopes the public can move on from the controversy and embrace the good that's come of the broader movement.
"The Women's March has never been easy. The weather has never been perfect," said Cruz, a 19-year-old freshman at Roosevelt University, as snow covered her hair just before the rally kicked off.
"But after all that women have been through this past year, we can handle a little snow."
Supporters huddled to stay warm, occasionally dodging plows clearing out the several inches of snow that had already accumulated. Roughly a dozen speakers using a megaphone tackled a range of topics including disability rights, violence against women and immigrant rights.
Nineteen-year-old Sydney Leidig of northwest suburban Algonquin stayed warm in her pink cat-eared knit cap, the icon of the movement from the original women's marches following the January 2017 inauguration of President Donald Trump. She said she didn't mind the cold and snow.
"There are women all over the world fighting for their rights in far worse conditions," she said. "If we can be here, we should."
Posters dotting the scene defended women's rights and mocked the president, including one with an image of Trump as an infant, declaring him "the only baby that belongs in a cage."
Megan Owens traveled from downstate Quincy on the train Friday night to take part in the rally. It was her first Women's March event -- she said she didn't understand the magnitude of the movement in 2017 and had to work in 2018.
"If you're not going to stand up for what you believe in, that's when complacency sets in," she said.
While Cruz had hoped for a crowd of 1,200, she said she was still very proud of what she called a powerful, youth-led event. "We definitely accomplished what we set out to do."
Marches were held in south suburban New Lenox, northwest suburban Woodstock and Rockford, as well as other cities across the country.
The New York Times reported a smaller crowd than usual at Women's March events in Washington, D.C., this year, amid stormy weather as well as infighting as Women's March Inc. continues to battle claims of anti-Semitic rhetoric and ties to Louis Farrakhan, whose Chicago-based Nation of Islam has been called a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
One organization in New Orleans canceled its local Women's March, citing the national controversy. Another in Houston rebuked national leaders in a statement titled "What we WON'T stand for."
Back in Geneva -- a suburb of roughly 22,000 -- organizers said they longed to continue the momentum spurred by the Women's March movement, advocating not just for the rights of women but also for the immigrant and LGBTQ communities, as well as causes like the environment and gun laws.
"We're tough and we are going to march through," said co-organizer Leah Beck. "We are going to stand up for our rights and not let the weather slow us down."
The event, which organizers said is not affiliated with Women's March Inc., drew women from all over the area, including Naperville, Elgin and Chicago. Metra added three commuter train cars on the Union Pacific-West line to accommodate the extra traffic.
Supporters gathered at the Old Kane County Courthouse for a pre-march rally before stepping off at South Third and James streets, and heading south to the Geneva Metra train station. The village closed Third Street to traffic to accommodate the crowd.
Marchers carried placards with such messages as "Families Belong Together" and "We are not afraid," and chanted, "This is what democracy looks like."
Various local politicians spoke, including Underwood and Casten, two newcomers to politics who flipped their respective seats blue in the midterm election.
Casten said it was remarkable to be among a freshman congressional class that has so much diversity.
"We are in a class that looks like America," he told the crowd.

Texto completo: “911. What is your emergency?”
“Help! I need backup!”
“Ambulance, fire or police?”
“Police! The Grammar Police! I’m surrounded by people attacking, abusing the English language.”
“I’m sure it’s very distressing for you, but the Grammar Police are no longer taking calls. They’ve been disbanded. Their forces were overrun, and they’ve given up the fight. You must be in one of the outlying districts and didn’t get the word. We recommend that you surrender.”
“Surrender? NEVER! Deceased English teachers by the millions are spinning in their graves. Something must be done.”
“The relentless tide of the ages cannot be swept back. Language evolves. New ways of speaking develop. Change is difficult for those who have been around awhile. Some new ways will never feel quite right. The good news is you may cling to the old ways. You may even consider them better. The new ways may never feel right. Are there some things you find particularly bothersome?”
“ ‘For free.’ Something is free or you have to pay something. The word ‘for’ suggests you’re going to pay something and the next word ‘free’ says no you don’t. You don’t need the word ‘for.’ It’s contradictory and confusing.”
“Logically, you are correct. I don’t like that change either. It’s not the way I speak. But many people do speak that way, and dictionaries and grammar guides are more likely to reflect the way people actually speak. Some battles are not worth fighting. Speak (or write) the way that is right for you; though if you speak English as if in the time of King James I, people might find you a bit, shall we say, eccentric.”
“Doth thou thinkest so? Gotta agree with that.”
“You are not alone. Just the other day (Jan. 5), LNP had a column by Cal Thomas venting his spleen about the decline in proper English usage. By the way, did you know that until sometime in the 19th century the spleen was thought to be the seat of anger in the body? We know better now, but the phrase is still around. And there was a letter to the editor decrying the misuse of words. The New York Times ran a column lauding Old(e) English (before 1066 or so). To read English over the years you need dictionaries close by. It’s enough to make your head spin.”
“It’s comforting to know I’m not alone. Are there support groups for people like me?”
“I’m not sure. I’ll have to do some checking. In the meantime, people around your age are more likely to have your word-use preferences.”
“Do the English speak better English?”
“Don’t count on it. It might have been George Bernard Shaw who observed that the British and the Americans were two peoples divided by a common language. That might also be attributed to Oscar Wilde. Then there’s that most prolific one of all: Anonymous. I knew an English woman who came to America to practice nursing. One day in the hospital a woman asked her if she was from ‘around here.’ She replied that she was born and raised in Britain. The woman responded: ‘I didn’t think you were from around here. You speak broken English.’ What is the right way to speak?”
“Change is a many-splendored thing, and sometimes it’s not too splendid. At least most of the time I can understand what people are saying even if I don’t want to speak that way.”
“Truth to tell, most of us are multilingual, even if it’s multi-English. In his memoir ‘In Pharaoh’s Army’, Tobias Wolf describes a sergeant who served with him in Vietnam: ‘He thought it was amazing that I could get along in Vietnamese, but he spoke about 10 different kinds of English, as occasion demanded.’ ”
“You’ve been very kind to spend so much time with me. Aren’t you very busy at 911 today?”
“It’s hopping around here, but you were the last call I was going to take. My shift is over.”
“It’s been a pleasure talking with you. Have you been at 911 long?”
“Just a few weeks. I guess I’m still adjusting. There’s a lot of my old job still in me.”
“What was your old job?”
“Many years as a high school English teacher. I couldn’t take it anymore.”

A conspiracy of dunces

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: "We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."
Douglas Cox, chairman of the Menominee Indian Tribe
GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy. Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending. Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.

Texto completo: Hospital patients often present their health care providers with difficult questions. One of the most challenging is this: How much is this test or treatment or procedure going to cost?
Doctors, nurses and other practitioners are rightly focused on the health of their patients, so questions of price may not necessarily be their first concern. But as health care costs skyrocket — and as health insurance gets more expensive, covers less and requires larger and larger deductibles — patients are becoming more sensitive to the costs of treatment.
In short, they are behaving more like shoppers than patients.
Unlike shoppers, however, hospital patients were often left in the dark when it came to the price of the service or procedure they needed. That’s because hospitals were allowed to keep their “master price lists” secret, or at least closely guarded.
As the Detroit Free Press reported earlier this month, the Affordable Care Act in 2010 required hospitals to make their price lists available to the public. But on Jan. 1, a mandate from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services required hospitals finally to publish the prices they charge for every service or procedure they offer.
Hospital care accounted for a third of all health care spending last year — a total of $1.1 trillion — so the new rules are a big win for transparency in health care costs, right? Not quite.
As Marianne Udow-Phillips, executive director of the Center for Health and Research Transformation in Ann Arbor, Mich., told the Free Press, the published price for a hospital service is “not a particularly useful datapoint.” That’s because these list prices are akin to the sticker price on a new car — in this case they’re the opening bid in negotiations between a hospital and an insurance company. They are not the price that most patients will end up paying.
“This is about empowering patients,” Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told The New York Times last week. That may be, but the execution of the new mandate leaves a lot to be desired.
No two hospitals seem to present information or describe procedures in the same way, the mandate provides no definition of “standard charges,” and the lists are simply impossible for the layperson to decipher. As The Times noted, Vanderbilt University Medical Center charges $42,569 for a cardiology procedure listed as “HC PTC CLOS PAT DUCT ART.”
“The posted prices are fanciful, inflated, difficult to decode and inconsistent, so it’s hard to see how an average person would find them useful,” Jeanne Pinder, founder and chief executive of the consumer health research organization Clear Health Costs, told The Times.
There are other, even more damaging potential side effects. University of Michigan professor Mark Fendrick told the Free Press that he feared patients who require a treatment or procedure will check the price on the hospital’s website, get sticker shock, and decide they cannot afford the needed care — even though what they would actually pay after accounting for insurance coverage and, in some cases, discounts offered by the hospital, would be significantly less.
It’s tempting to laud any effort to get health care costs under control. But simply requiring hospitals to post prices without establishing a system to make the resulting information useful isn’t even a Band-Aid on the problem. In fact, if it dissuades some patients to forgo the care they need, it may do real harm.
A much more comprehensive approach to fixing the nation’s health care system is desperately needed, but we may have to wait until 2020 to see real action on that front.

Texto completo: New Yorks Red Apple Group expects to break ground early this year on a soaring tower in downtown St. Petersburg that will include condos, a 200-room hotel, event space and possibly room for offices.

I want to do something that we will all be proud of, John Catsimatidis, Red Apples billionaire founder, said in a phone interview Thursday.

In a full page ad in the New York Times, the company unveiled a draft rendering of an approximately 50-story tower that will be taller than anything on Floridas west coast except for the proposed Riverwalk Place in downtown Tampa. The newly completed ONE St. Petersburg condominium near the citys downtown waterfront tops out at 41 stories.

Catsimatidis said he thinks Red Apples tower  which would dwarf everything nearby  already has gotten at least a tentative okay from the Federal Aviation Administration. Buildings close to downtowns Albert Whitted Airport are subject to certain height restrictions.

As shown in another rendering that Catsimatidis provided, the building designed by the Miami firm Arquitec

tonica will be angled northeast to southwest on the now-vacant 400 block of Central Avenue. The tower appears to be encircled by narrow, wavy bands. Those actually are balconies, Catsimatidis said, although they are subject to change.

The architects are doing the final drawings or plans, and there is one final open item on how the balconies are going to look, he said. Subject to that, we will be ready to start breaking ground in the first quarter of this year.

St. Petersburg planning director Elizabeth Abernethy said the city has not yet received any plans for the project.

The tower will rise on the 400 block of Central Avenue, which Red Apple bought for $16.5 million in 2017. The project will consist of a single building that will include around 325 condos and 800 parking spaces. Catsimatidis said he has met fairly recently with Mayor Rick Kriseman, who has said he thinks the city has enough high-end residences but could use another hotel and more Class A office space.

Office space is an open item, Catsimatidis said. We havent done anything on that yet, but Im personally open to suggestions. Im all for it. If we can do the right deal, we can make it happen.

The ad in a real estate supplement to the New York Times promises that the tower will have breathtaking views of Tampa Bay from luxury condominium residences and an exclusive full serve boutique hotel and event space. The ad also shows a luxury apartment complex in Coney Island that Red Apple is opening this spring.

Texto completo: A day long awaited by survivors of Albany's gantlet of lawmakers' leers and lewd comments and gropes and secret payoffs approaches: The state Senate and Assembly will hold a joint public hearing next month on workplace sexual harassment. Better embarrassingly late than never.
What is sure to be wrenching testimony from women in all sorts of workplaces will bolster the case for measures aimed to help victims have a fair shot at redress. Those include a key proposal from Gov. Cuomo to make it easier to prove in court that harassment happened - removing a requirement that in order to prove harassment, conduct must be "severe and pervasive."
Bills from newly elected Bronx Sen. Alexandra Biaggi - who defeated Jeff Klein, accused of forcing a kiss on a staffer - would warn those about to sign confidentiality agreements of the rights they would waive (ahem, Harvey Weinstein), while defendants who repeatedly sign discrimination and harassment settlements (ahem, Bill O'Reilly) would be reported to the state attorney general.
While Albany awakens, New York City Hall snores. The New York Times reported that a top aide to Mayor de Blasio, Kevin O'Brien, was quietly forced to resign in 2017 following a sexual harassment investigation - only to land at a political consulting firm close to the mayor, with no mention of why he was ousted.
"An absolutely unacceptable situation," the mayor called it this week, speaking of O'Brien's unspecified conduct. Those words apply doubly to his poor call to shroud a perpetrator's departure, putting others unknowingly in his path.

Texto completo: I'm supposed to be a statistic.
On July 14, 2012, drowning in grief and guilt, I tried to kill myself. Like so many veterans, I had found civilian life desperately difficult. War had drained me of joy. The sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield had been relentlessly looping in my head. The suffering seemed endless.
And so, thinking there were no other options of escape, I turned to suicide.
Luckily, I survived. I avoided becoming one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves every day in this country. But I also witnessed firsthand all the ways that our nation's mental health resources fail our fighting men and women. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and the military simply aren't equipped to properly treat sick vets.
We must do better.
More: My husband lost a limb in Afghanistan. Now, as his caregiver, I'm on the front lines.
More: My partner died by suicide. He doesn't know the damage he left behind.
I enlisted in the military on Sept. 11, 2001. My first major combat experience came on a deployment to Sadr City, Iraq, in the winter of 2005, the apex of the insurgency.
War inflicts permanent psychic scars on survivors. Scrubbing a friend's flesh out of a Bradley reconnaissance vehicle, packing up the cold clothes of a new dad to ship home to his family, pulling tortured corpses out of a water treatment facility — the trauma from these experiences is deep and lasting.
Veterans lost to trauma, rather than combat
That trauma can be more deadly than war itself. More of my brothers from that deployment have died from suicide than combat: Nine were killed in Iraq; 15 have killed themselves back at home.
Our company commander, a decorated vet boasting four Meritorious Service Medals, shot himself on Jan. 16, 2016. He was just 44 years old. Readers of his obituary in the local newspaper might have recognized his face; two years earlier, he had appeared in a photo story about a local military appreciation fish fry, grinning from ear-to-ear and playing with his beloved dogs.
My grandfather, a World War II veteran, committed suicide when my father was sent to Vietnam.
And just last month, decorated Navy Vice Adm. Scott Stearney's body was found in his Bahrain residence after an apparent suicide. During his life, Vice Adm. Stearney was awarded the Air Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Superior Service Medal.
Many vets feel ashamed that they're suffering and work to hide their pain, even from their closest friends and family. When a universally respected officer takes his life, the despair trickles down the chain of command.
Vets shouldn't be dying in a VA parking lot
Existing mental health services for vets are clearly insufficient. From 2001 to 2014, vet suicides have jumped 32 percent. The problem is only going to get worse.
Too many VA facilities simply don't have enough staff to provide personalized care. Therapists are badly outnumbered and vets are hurried through their offices.
Sometimes, staffing shortages force facilities to simply turn vets away, leading to the grotesque phenomenon of desperate soldiers killing themselves on VA grounds.
One 51-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran set himself on fire in front of a New Jersey VA clinic after a canceled appointment. Another veteran shot himself in the waiting room of a VA medical center. A 76-year-old vet shot himself in the parking lot of his Long Island VA facility because "he went to the ER and was denied service," as a hospital employee explained to The New York Times.
But improving treatment requires more than new resources. Our mental health system must also evolve its therapeutic paradigms to be more proactive, treating the root causes of mental illness. Too often, VA facilities are purely reactive, only kicking into action once a vet is suffering a crisis. Proactively addressing the precursors to suicidal ideation can prevent the crisis in the first place.
One of those key precursors is isolation. We go to war with our brothers — but we're left to fight demons at home by ourselves. The VA mental health system needs to create more opportunities for vets to meet each other, share their stories, break that isolation, and process their pain. This is battle-forged trust and understanding. We need our battle buddies to survive post-combat as much as we need them to survive during it. Picnics, afternoon runs, bowling tournaments — simple gatherings can work wonders.
That's why my organization, the Independence Fund, is teaming up with the VA to carry out Operation Resiliency. The just-launched partnership provides mental health training retreats for vets and their families, and encourages camaraderie among vets through adaptive sports.
Our military should have a role in prevention as well. Americans are expertly trained to go into battle but receive virtually zero training on what comes next. Each branch of the military should work with vets and their families to develop a personalized mental health plan for when they get home.
Veteran suicide is a national scandal. We must repair and expand the mental health system for our fighting men and women. We must win the war at home.
Danny O'Neel, an Iraq War veteran, is a speaker on suicide prevention, PTSD and mental health for the Independence Fund.

Texto completo: Jack Bogle was an investment industry legend. In Boston, he was also a legendary pain in the butt.
Bogle, who died Wednesday at the age of 89, founded Vanguard Group in 1975and proceeded — slowly at first, then like a juggernaut in the past two decades — to undermine the very premise upon which much of Boston's fund industry was built: that professional stock-pickers are worth the fees they charge investors for managing their money in mutual funds.
At Vanguard, which is headquartered in a small town about 30 miles west of Philadelphia, Bogle created the first fund tied to a stock index for individual investors. Opened in 1976, the Vanguard Index Trust (now the Vanguard 500 Index Fund) was designed to match as closely as possible the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a benchmark for the biggest US stocks.
The goal was simple but anathema to most of the investment world: Instead of paying fat fees to high-priced managers to research and select stocks, Vanguard customers were offered low-cost funds that mirror various baskets for stocks (and later bonds).
“He gave the industry a new way of thinking that was considered complete heresy at the time," said John Casey, former chairman of Casey Quirk, a management consulting firm that caters to the asset management industry. Most people at fund companies “were dismissive of anything that didn't particularly add value. But he was focused on building a business that had never been built before," he said.
There would be no picking of winners and losers at Vanguard. The investor in its passively managed funds would ride the market up (mainly) and down (sometimes precipitously). And there would be no star managers like Peter Lynch at Fidelity Investments or Bill Miller at Legg Mason to attract investors. But that was fine by Bogle because he believed that no matter how smart, no manager could beat the market consistently over a long period of time.
“My ideas are very simple," he told The New York Times in 2012. “In investing, you get what you don't pay for. Costs matter. So intelligent investors will use low-cost index funds to build a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, and they will stay the course. And they won't be foolish enough to think that they can consistently outsmart the market."
Active fund managers in Boston and the rest of the industry scoffed at Vanguard as it rolled out index fund after index fund and (now numbering 190 in the United States and another 220 overseas). In part, they sincerely believed that they could deliver better results than following the market. But they also recognized that Bogle's relentless focus on lowering the costs of running funds — which allowed him to charge smaller fees — had enormous implications for the profits active management made possible.
Vanguard got off to a slow start, with mostly sophisticated investors buying into the power of lower fees to bolster returns. But over time, mainstream investors warmed to the idea of index funds and their close cousins, index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially after the bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2008-2009, when many active managers lost more than market averages.
While some managers were charging asset management fees of 2 percent or more even when they lagged their benchmarks, Vanguard was cutting its fees, taking them down by almost two-thirds over the past two decades to an average of 0.11 percent.
That triggered a price war that has eaten into profits at active and passive fund managers alike. Boston-based Fidelity eventually got into index funds and ETFs, after holding out a long time under then-chairman Ned Johnson, and is seeing good inflows. In August the company even launched two no-fee funds.
But Vanguard's unique structure gives it an edge on fees: It is owned by its fund investors (much like policy holders own mutual insurance companies), not private shareholders.
“Jack was always a tough competitor of ours and kept us on our toes, and for that I am grateful," Abby Johnson, chairman of Fidelity, said in a statement to the Globe, echoing a view shared by other local firms.
“While his focus on index investing helped build significant adoption of passively managed strategies in the industry, I believe his views challenged active managers to be better at what they do," Andy Arnott, CEO of John Hancock Investments, said in a statement. “He will have a lasting impact on the way investors build portfolios for years to come."
Competition was good for Vanguard, too. It is the second-largest fund manager in the world, with about $5 trillion under management. Fidelity has about $2.7 trillion, while New York-based BlackRock, a big proponent of indexing, tops the list with $6.3 trillion.
There are still more assets in actively run funds in ($10.4 trillion) than in passive funds ($6.58 trillion), according to US data from industry tracker Morningstar. But the momentum is clearly with indexers: Last year, passive funds brought in a net $458 billion compared with net outflows of $303.4 billion at active funds.
Nevertheless, some fund companies remain true believers in the merits of active investing. Putnam Investments in Boston is one of them.
“For active managers to justify their being, they have to add a premium to the benchmark," said Bob Reynolds, Putnam's chief executive, who notes that the percentage of active managers outperforming their benchmarks has increased to 45 percent last year. “That's still not high enough. . . . but I think you are starting to see a change there. It's very cyclical."
Reynolds, who was vice chairman at Fidelity before jumping to Putnam, says his firm — which only sells active funds — had net inflows last year.
Still, he has nothing but the highest respect for Bogle.
“He's on Mount Rushmore," he said. “And I'd add Ned Johnson right there next to him or ahead of him for all the innovations he brought to the market. They are the fathers of the fund industry."
Yes, Boston was once king of the fund game. Now we have to share the crown.

An Imaginary Love Story Behind the Taj Mahal

Texto completo: Imperialism for the masses, the movie culture of the 1920s, purveyed romantic fantasies of an imaginary East. Theaters were designed to evoke the Alhambra. Rudolph Valentino rose to stardom as the Sheik; Douglas Fairbanks cavorted as the Thief of Bagdad. A Photoplay writer declared Scheherazade was the muse of cinema, and studio bosses were known as "movie moguls."
In contrast, the 1929 spectacle "Shiraz: A Romance of India" -- at Metrograph in a fine 4K digital restoration by the British Film Institute -- came by its heritage honestly. Based on Indian source material -- albeit directed by a German national, Franz Osten, heading a mainly European crew -- "Shiraz" was filmed on location in and around Jaipur with an all-Indian cast, including its producer and guiding light, Himansu Rai, in the title role as the man who designed the Taj Mahal.
Less an exercise in outsider exoticism than a monument to national pride, "Shiraz" invents an imaginary back story for the 17th-century empress whose death inspired her husband to commission the world's most celebrated mausoleum. The movie opens in grand fashion as brigands waylay a desert caravan carrying a toddler princess. Orphaned in the melee, the child is adopted by a village family that includes a ready-made older brother, Shiraz. Growing into a spirited young woman named Selima (Enakshi Rama Rau), she's abducted by slave traders and purchased for the harem of a handsome crown prince (Charu Roy, an actor who went on to become a director). Complications ensue when the bereft Shiraz (Rai) sets off to rescue her.
Osten, who with his brother founded a movie studio in Munich, is a more than capable director of expansive battles and intimate love scenes but also has an eye for the baroque symmetry of Islamic architecture and an even better one for the landscape of Rajasthan.
[Video: 'Shiraz: A Romance of India' | by Franz Osten | Presented at Cinem'Art - Louvre Abu Dhabi Watch on YouTube.]
"Shiraz" was the second of three silent movies Osten directed in India in conjunction with Rai. (The last, "A Throw of Dice," taken from the Mahabharata, is available for rent or purchase on Amazon.) The coming of sound sent Osten back to Germany, but in 1934 he returned to India where Rai had established a studio and made 16 talking pictures until he was interned by British authorities as a member of the Nazi Party and deported in 1939.
According to Mordaunt Hall's review in The New York Times, "Shiraz" boasted about 50,000 extras, 300 camels and seven elephants -- one drafted as an executioner, foot poised to crush a condemned man's skull. Hollywood could only aspire to the opulence afforded by the movie's palace gardens and expansive mosques, let alone by the finished Taj Mahal.
No less impressive than these lavish backdrops are the movie's understated performances and its overall naturalism. Satyajit Ray, who brought neorealism to India in his 1955 "Pather Panchali," praised Osten as a pioneer with a "decided penchant for realism."
The restored "Shiraz" is further enhanced by the composer-sitar player Anoushka Shankar. As her father Ravi Shankar's inspired improvisation gave "Pather Panchali" a lyrical jolt, so her dramatic, infectiously percussive score, performed by a traditional ensemble infused with strings and a Moog synthesizer, sets the pace of this movie.

Texto completo: This article contains multiple spoilers for the Netflix film "Bird Box."
The bird box in "Bird Box" is full of holes so the birds can breathe; "Bird Box" the movie is full of holes so the audience can meme.
For a certain type of fan, half the fun of watching "Bird Box" is pointing out all the logical gaps. The rules in "Bird Box" are never fully articulated, never fully understood, leaving room to debate its mysteries and its deeper allegorical meaning (if any). It's a movie that loves to raise unanswerable questions, and over the last few weeks, the internet has followed suit: Where did these monsters originate? Was Jacki Weaver's character a doctor the whole time? Where did Felix and Lucy go?
The film has drawn widespread comparisons to last year's other big sensory-deprivation horror film, "A Quiet Place," which has plenty of its own inconsistencies. But many of the apparent gaps in "Bird Box" have explanations if you know where to look: Some are tucked away in the movie itself; others can be found in the source novel by Josh Malerman.
Below, we've done our best to plug some of the holes. And while we may never know what really caused the suicide pandemic -- or why any normal person's kitchen needs a huge glass-fronted freezer -- we do think the Janet Tucker School for the Blind has a few things to investigate.
[Read The New York Times's review of "Bird Box."]
Why run from the creatures if they aren't solid?
Panic maybe? Otherwise ... there is no reason. No one can agree on what these entities are -- Cthulhu-like demons? biowarfare artifacts? handy metaphors? -- but whatever they are, this much seems apparent: They do not have a solid, corporeal form.
They can infiltrate your head, imitate voices, throw creepy shadows, even whip up the wind, but they don't seem able to break down doors or open windows. Their presence sets off a car's proximity sensors, but they can't blow off your blindfold. So don't take it off yourself. And also don't run! Especially if you can't see where you're going. Because you're still wearing that blindfold, right?
What about people who have blurry vision?
That blindfold worn by Malorie (Sandra Bullock) doesn't obscure everything -- some play of light and shadow always seeps through. This suggests that those with limited sight might be safe if they remove their corrective lenses: Somewhere in the spectrum, between perfect eyesight and none, lies a critical threshold.
Greg's experiment with the security camera proved fatal, but he was probably onto something. In the book (in which the character is called George), he has a number of other ideas -- refracted glass, indirect vision -- but he never gets a chance to experiment with them.
How is Fish Finger still alive?
Charlie's (Lil Rel Howery) co-worker from the seafood department, known as Fish Finger (Matt Leonard), was trapped on a loading dock for at least four days. The human body can't survive more than four days without water, and yet Fish Finger is still strong enough to force open a door while three people do their best to hold it closed. How did he survive?
Charlie describes Fish Finger as "a bit crazy"; according to the story's logic, he must have been more mentally disturbed than Charlie realized. That partly explains his survival. But how mentally ill was he? That may explain the rest. When we catch a glimpse inside the loading dock, we see a couple of dead bodies. A close look at the bodies and the blood on his fingers suggest what he did to stay nourished. Getting Charlie to see the creatures -- "Look at it, Charlie, it's beautiful" -- also provided Fish Finger with a new snack.
How did Tom and Malorie manage to keep looking so hot?
After five years of sub-optimum nutrition, Malorie is still looking toned. Tom (Trevante Rhodes) still has his six-pack. (And, as Missy Elliott noted on Twitter, "His hair cut stayed sharp.") Although the film mostly shows us stale Pop-Tarts, the book has them stocking up the cellar with canned food, including sources of protein such as tuna, refried beans and nuts, by raiding abandoned homes. (The movie follows Malorie on one of what we can assume are many of those raids.) The garden in the movie seems fairly extensive, too.
Worried about running out, Malorie also learned to fish while blindfolded, using a rusted fishing pole fashioned from an umbrella, according to the book. In the movie, watch how she counts down the steps on her way to the river -- she has been here before. As for attractive body tone, look at all the running around they have to do! Still, in the book, Malorie is gaunt, her skin tight and sallow from malnutrition. So maybe the best answer is simply: Hollywood.
What kind of supermarket sells pet birds and walkie-talkies?
In real life ... probably none? After a perilous journey rolling over "speed bumps" of human corpses, the gang arrives at a supermarket -- Fields Market, to be precise, which is a real place. If you visited the actual location in West Hills, Calif., you would find pet food in the pets section and batteries in the "electronics section," but no live animals and no high-end walkie-talkies. (We called and asked; the staffer who answered laughed.) The filmmakers stocked those items themselves.
Where are all the pets?
Speaking of pets, a majority of United States households have at least one of them, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. So what happened to all the cats and dogs? Or, for that matter, the wild game and livestock? Early in the movie, a single horse appears on the news -- after that, we see mostly birds. Are animals also vulnerable?
In the book, we get some answers. The birds aren't entirely immune, it seems -- we're told about migrating flocks that kill themselves in midair. As for other animals, the group uses seeing-eye dogs in the book, and one of them gets infected. ("It sounded like Victor had chewed through his own leg.") In the final scene of the movie, we're shown some seeing-eye dogs at the blind school. Presumably, they have been adequately sheltered from the monsters, just like the seeing humans who are there.
How did those birds in the box survive?
The birds in the Bird Box -- a shoe box with holes punched in it -- appear to be scarlet-chested parakeets, a rare Australian breed that likes to be housed in bigger cages or aviaries ... or, of course, allowed to fly free. So how did these birds survive going overboard on a cold river? The short answer is: They shouldn't have. Unless Girl (Vivien Lyra Blair) held it over her head as she swam to shore -- also unlikely for a small child in the rapids -- that shoe box would have been a death trap.
Brianna Latino of the Bird Shop in Roseville, Calif., which sells exotic birds, confirmed that the birds looked like scarlet-chested parakeets -- and probably should have died a few times over. "They surely wouldn't survive in a freezer," she said.
Why didn't Malorie and the kids just hop out of the boat and follow the river on foot once they heard the rapids coming?
Such a good question.
How is that remote compound so well stocked?
The community at Janet Tucker School for the Blind seems close to self-sufficient in the film, and in the book, it is. The members farm fields of potatoes, squash, and berries. They've captured a cow for milk, a few chickens for eggs and two goats, and they hope to find more to build a little farm. They have a rainwater purification system. They also have a whole medical team. (One hopes it includes therapists to help process everyone's trauma.)
Apparently, the fastest way to get there is the river. Did Dr. Lapham (Parminder Nagra) take a blindfolded rowboat trip, too? That much remains a mystery.

Texto completo: Sarah Hirshland took over as chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee at a fraught time. The organization was reeling from heavy criticism over its response, or its lack of one, to the sexual abuse accusations against Lawrence G. Nassar, then a team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics.
Now, after six months in the job, Hirshland spoke with reporters and editors of The New York Times about some of the issues that have dominated the early part of her tenure.
Hirshland began the discussion by highlighting four key areas.
Hirshland: The first is, maintaining clear focus on the mission to empower athletes to succeed on the highest level, on the grandest stages, and doing so in an environment that provides them the safety, the resources and the tools they need to be successful in that adventure.
The second is ensuring that athletes have a voice and a seat at the table as the organization is making decisions. They have to play a critical part not only on the field of play but off the field of play.
The third is striving for an environment in the Olympic movement that's free of abuse. There's some work that's been done, work that's being done and work that we need to do.
The fourth is focusing on stewarding the Olympic and Paralympic movement in this country as we think about our role on the global stage.
Excerpts from the interview with Hirshland are below:
Do you need federal funding at this point? For decades, you got no federal funding. Is it time to say we need to get a lot of money from the federal government?
One of the things I hope to do is identify the revenue gap between the size of the pie today and what we think a reasonable size of the pie could and should be to provide the funding to all of the athletes who have the capability to compete at the Olympic and Paralympic level. There is a revenue gap. If every athlete who had the talent to compete had the tools they needed, what would that number be?
I can't tell you today what that revenue gap is. Then the question becomes, what's the best way to fill it?
Will you push for government funding for the U.S. Center for SafeSport?
Every meeting I've had in Washington, I've asked for money for the Center for SafeSport.
How much?
We asked for, it was before my time, I think $5 million a year. What came back was $2.5 million over five years.
I don't think there's an easy answer that says, yes, the government's going to fund this to this amount and here's where it's going to come from. We don't have any confidence that real funding is going to come at this point.
I would think it would be a priority to get it funded properly because it's sadly underfunded.
The center asked us for $6.2 million next year. We said yes. They haven't come back and said we need more money.
There are coaches that have been banned who are still coaching. These guys are still out there. Sources have said they put in a complaint to SafeSport and no one got back to them. They probably need a lot more money not only for policing but education.
There is no doubt that the capacity of the center is not where it needs to be to handle the volume. My understanding is that they are growing and hiring as fast as they can. Funding is not the issue; it's capacity and growth rate. It's a huge priority for us. But at the same time, it's an independent organization that's accountable to its board. We have given them every dollar they have asked for. If SafeSport needs more money, I certainly hope that they will ask for it.
There's still fallout from all the lawsuits. Are you confident the U.S.O.C. will survive? Will it have to declare bankruptcy?
I am confident, based on the information I have today, that we will be able to resolve the litigation and be strong and healthy as we go forward.
We take the litigation and our responsibility very seriously. The Olympic movement failed these athletes, and we absolutely have a moral and ethical obligation.
How have the sponsorships changed? Have you had trouble gaining new sponsorships or lost a lot of sponsorships?
We have not. It's been a natural process: Sometimes a sponsor doesn't renew and you add a new sponsor, that's a natural evolution. The numbers and the revenue are not markedly different.
What's an early look at the Los Angeles Olympics? Are people going to be excited about L.A.?
Based on really early measures, the answer is absolutely yes. The energy around it is very positive. But this will ebb and flow. We're still a little bit in the honeymoon of the news that it's coming.
You're interfacing with a troubled movement internationally. They're getting turned down by cities. There has been enormous corruption. It's a troubled model. How do you fit into that? Is there a larger, existential problem?
And yet there are thousands of athletes whose lives are changed for the better constantly by this movement. There's no doubt there are two sides to the coin. You can't get too focused on the side you just described that you lose sight of the side I choose to spend more time thinking about.
Fundamentally, the Olympics and sports in general are about breaking down barriers and uniting people. The complexities of the system continue to expose challenges and the need for change.
We have to set the example, and we have to play better ourselves. We can't possibly solve all of that if we don't have our own house in order.
Do you think the current Olympic model works? Every four years having a new city hosting the Olympics?
It's fiscally not responsible to create the infrastructure for an Olympic Games just for an Olympic Games. That can't work. A city has to either need the infrastructure and use the Olympics to accelerate its development, or the infrastructure has to exist. The notion that we're going to go here and build the infrastructure for the Olympics is not sustainable.
As we looked at opportunities for the Winter Games, that's an incredibly compelling reality of Salt Lake City. There is not a construction requirement there to host an Olympic Games.
Are there other cities in the pipeline?
We have been very clear in selecting Salt Lake, to not encourage other cities to prepare to host a Winter Games. We have determined that Salt Lake is our best foot forward for the Winter. And we are not even contemplating Summer beyond L.A.
How confident are you that L.A. will make a profit?
I feel really good about L.A. It's 10 years out, but the fundamental economic model is really strong because the infrastructure is where the huge part of the cost is. And the infrastructure was either there or was already in the plan to be built as part of L.A.'s natural development.
Under your predecessor, the staff of the U.S.O.C. would get bonuses depending on the performance of the athletes at the Olympics. Is that a good model?
One of the things I've changed is the staff incentive model for 2019. There is still a component of athletic success, but it is much more based on a variety of components.
What has the last six months been like?
I logged 115,000 miles in my first five months. I had to make choices about going deep or going broad. I went really broad and met a lot of people at a cursory level. Now I'm starting to home in on priorities.
It feels now like a manageable intake, like I have enough space mentally and time to start to take control and implement change.
The only way I can be good and strong for the organization is to keep myself strong mentally and physically. I'm working hard to make sure this doesn't consume me.
I can't be fearful on this job. Being fearful on this job is not a recipe for success.

Texto completo: CHELSEA, Mich. - Never Not Once, a new play by Carey Crim, will have its world premiere at the Purple Rose Theatre, the second work to be presented in the theater's 28th season.

In Never Not Once, Eleanor, a biology major at Princeton, brings boyfriend Rob home to meet her two moms, and tells them she has hired a private investigator to help find her biological father. As a scientist, Eleanor is curious about her genetics. Nadine, her mom who is not her biological mother, likes the idea, but the other, Allison, who is Eleanor's biological mother, tells her that her biological father was a one-night stand in college whose name she doesn't remember. Still, Eleanor searches for an answer to Where do I come from?

This play is a beautiful, searing, and timely new play by one of America's most talented and prolific playwrights, Carey Crim. With uncommon humor, compassion, and honesty, Never Not Once explores the costs of keeping secrets from loved ones, and what defines a family in today's world, and asks the question, 'Are all sins worthy of redemption?' said Guy Sanville, Purple Rose artistic director. Sanville is directing the play.

Never Not Once was awarded the Jane Chambers Feminist Playwriting Award in 2017. It marks Crim's fifth world premiere at the Purple Rose.

Performances run from Thursday through March 16. Previews, with reduced-price tickets, are available through Jan. 24; opening night is Jan. 25 at the Purple Rose Theatre Company, 137 Park St., in Chelsea.

Tickets range from $23 to $47 with discounts for students, seniors, teachers, members of the military, and groups of 12 and more. For more information or to make reservations, call 734-433-7673 or go to purplerosetheatre.org.

On Broadway

Jeff Daniels, actor, playwright, musician, and native of Chelsea, founded the Purple Rose Theatre Company in 1991.

He has premiered 16 full-length plays at the theater in the past 25 years: Shoe Man, The Tropical Pickle, The Vast Difference, Thy Kingdom's Coming, Escanaba in da Moonlight, Apartment 3A, Boom Town, Across the Way (a 2002 American Theatre Critics Association Best New Play finalist), Norma & Wanda, Guest Artist (a 2006 ATCA Best New Play runner-up), Escanaba In Love, Panhandle Slim & The Oklahoma Kid, Escanaba, Best of Friends, The Meaning of Almost Everything (a 2013 American Theater Critics Association Best New Play nominee), and Casting Session, as reported on the Purple Rose website.

Daniels received Tony Award nominations for Best Actor for his performances in Broadway show God of Carnage in 2009 and Blackbird in 2016.

And now Daniels is back on Broadway, starring as Atticus Finch at the Shubert Theatre in a new play by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, an adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, the story of a small-town lawyer, Atticus Finch, who defends an innocent black man accused of raping a white woman in rural Alabama in the 1930s.

Sorkin's To Kill a Mockingbird was the subject of some controversy. The late Harper Lee's estate sued Sorkin's producer over the To Kill a Mockingbird project, alleging that his Atticus Finch is too mean, his children, Scout and Jem, are too old, and housekeeper Calpurnia is too opinionated, among other issues, according to a March New York Times article about the legal battle. But the controversy was settled and previews of the Broadway play began in November.

Two friends and I decided to make a weekend trip to New York to see To Kill a Mockingbird on a Friday evening in mid-November when the play was in previews. During previews, the director and crew members can discover problems and make improvements and adjustments before the opening. The play opened Dec. 13.

The preview production of To Kill a Mockingbird was worth the trip. The acting was superb, especially Daniels, whose portrayal of a lawyer in a small town in the South has sensitivity and strength, and La Tanya Richardson Jackson, who plays Calpurnia. In Sorkin's adaptation, Calpurnia is tough and in command when she goes head-to-head with Atticus in a discussion of the trial.

In a recent review, AM NewYork theater critic Matt Windman wrote about Sorkin's adaptation of Lee's classic novel: Although the plot remains relatively intact, Sorkin has adapted the book with an eye toward dramatic structure, character development, and contemporary cultural relevance. Perhaps more crucially, Sorkin has opened up the book's most prominent black characters, allowing them to more fully express themselves, and Sorkin presents Atticus as a central protagonist and a more complicated figure, whose views are challenged and changed. Some of Sorkin's choices are questionable. In any event, Mockingbird proves to be an engrossing, provocative, and uniformly well-acted adaptation.

One of our group summed up her opinion of the preview performance by saying that although it was too long, the play made her want to read Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird again.

Lawmakers here today, gone to Maui

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Autor: Stossel, John.

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Mamma Mia, here we go again

Texto completo: Saturday afternoon at Moxxee in Charleston was bustling.
Most of the steel tables at the East End coffee house were full, and womanSong director, Montessori teacher and Charleston Light Opera Guild member Emily Capece seemed nearly swallowed up in the crowd.
Capece had just polished off a small pot of tea and was taking a pause between a Saturday workshop with her womens' chorus, grading student papers and going over her lines for the guild's production of the jukebox musical "Mama Mia.
The show, based around the music of superstar 70s Swedish pop group ABBA, opens Friday at the Clay Center.
"It's not my usual role, Capece acknowledged. "Usually, I go for the heavier, more dramatic things.
Over the past decade, the Ohio native has been a recurring lead for the guild. Two years ago, she was one of the leads in the guild's surprise summer hit, "The Bridges of Madison County. She also played the title role in the company's productions of "Mary Poppins and "Evita, was Fantine in the guild's production of "Les Miserables, and played Grace Farrell, the faithful secretary to Daddy Warbucks in "Annie.
Capece has always been selective about auditioning for roles, but this time, she's performing with the guild because she's a dyed-in-the-wool ABBA fan.
In high school, she said she wore out a cassette copy of ABBA's "Gold while driving around the Cleveland area in her father's Oldsmobile, often singing along at the top of her lungs, her younger brother and his friends in the backseat, chiming in, too.
After she graduated and moved away, Capece kept her love for ABBA, but didn't get around to seeing the musical until just a year or two ago, long after she saw the 2008 film based on the show.
At the time, she thought the film was a bit silly but fun, though the show itself has had an odd, almost unexpected life.
One of the first jukebox musicals, the show is built around ABBA hits, which are arranged to form a story involving a single mother, the aftermath of a summer of love and a daughter who wants to know who her father is before she becomes a bride.
"There isn't a deep plot, Capece acknowledged.
When the musical opened on Broadway in October of 2001, critics gave "Mama Mia tepid reviews - except for Ben Brantley of The New York Times, who, in his way, hailed the show, calling it "the theatrical equivalent of comfort food.
Following the grim weeks after 9/11, it might have been the kind of show to cheer a weary and frazzled city. Eventually, "Mama Mia caught on and became one of Broadway's longest running musicals.
"It's just a really good time, where you'll sing and dance in the aisles, Capece said. "It's not deep, but Mama Mia' is a fun, feel-good kind of show that is maybe a good break from the gray and gloom of winter and all the bad news.
Capece plays Donna, the mother of bride-to-be Sophie, which she said felt odd to her, as an actress.
"I'm the oldest woman in the cast, she said. "That's a little jarring, and not everyone who joined the show knew the music. They came in because maybe they saw the movie or just because they recognized the title.
The womanSong director said she's enjoyed watching and listening to some of her castmates embrace the music, as they've learned the words to the songs.
Capece said she's had to learn or relearn the lyrics, too. Not every word she belted out as a teenager behind the wheel of her father's Oldsmobile was absolutely right.
Capece is proud to be part of this show, which will be her last with the Charleston Light Opera Guild.
For a while now, she said she's been thinking about going home to Cleveland.
When she graduated high school and left Ohio 22 years ago, the actress and teacher said it was "peace, out for her.
Capece never intended to move back, but her parents are getting older and she's discovered that she misses home.
A few months ago, her husband was offered a job in the Cleveland area so the Capece family will be packing up and moving at the end of the school year.
"When we got here, this was all part of a five-year plan, Capece said.
Then life happened. Five years turned into eight and then into 11.
"My children were born here, she said.
Charleston has been good to her, Capece said. The city welcomed her and gave her opportunities to do things she might not have been able to do elsewhere, like teach children, oversee a women's choir and do musical theater, all at the same time.
"They say yes' to a lot more here, Capece said.
The people she's met in Charleston, she added, have been great. Leaving West Virginia isn't easy. She doesn't have a job in Ohio yet. She and her husband haven't even put the house up on the market yet.
"I should probably get on that, she laughed. "But if anybody is looking, it is a cute house.

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The lone lawmaker who prevented the House of Representatives from unanimously denouncing Rep. Steve King, due to worries that the measure didn't go far enough, saw his censure effort against the Iowa Republican fizzle on Wednesday.
Rep. Bobby Rush, a civil rights leader and Democrat representing Illinois, attempted on Wednesday, the day after the House voted 424 to 1 to condemn King, to bring up a censure resolution over King's comments about white nationalism.
His resolution, which included King's remarks questioning why terms like "white supremacists" were offensive and other controversial comments over the years about immigrants, including his comparison of undocumented people to livestock, was read aloud on the House floor. But the measure was moved to the House Ethics Committee, meaning the committee could examine the measure and lawmakers wouldn't vote on it.
"Representative Steve King of Iowa, by his despicable conduct, has dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House and merits the censure of the House for the same," part of the resolution read.
A censure is the second most serious punishment in the House, just behind being expelled from serving in Congress. A censure is basically a formal and public rebuke meant to embarrass, as the lawmaker being targeted would have to stand on the House floor and listen as the censure was read aloud before his colleagues.
While Rush would have liked the House to take a more aggressive route to punish King, he told USA TODAY that it was probably best so it didn't cause division within the party.
Related: House passes resolution condemning Rep. King over white supremacy comments, with his help
King has a history of controversial remarks: Here are some that riled people up
Rush would have to appeal the decision thus, putting him at odds with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Right now, Rush said, Democrats are concerned with the government shutdown and being "divided over the issue" wouldn't "serve the nation well. "
But, he said he could bring the censure back for consideration if King has another slip-up.
"I reserve the right to revive my motion if Steve makes one more utterance of bigotry, and racism and misogynism," Rush told USA TODAY. "If he makes one more utterance, then I will revive my motion. "
It's unclear whether the House Ethics Committee, which is not known for its speed or aggressiveness, will take up the issue.
On Tuesday, King supported efforts that denounced his rhetoric and said his "white supremacist" comments in a New York Times interview had not come across as he intended.
Opinion: JD Scholten: Here's how I nearly beat Steve King and here's why he keeps winning. So far.
King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy. " The resolution invoked King’s comments and condemned such words as “hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States. ”
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.

Food giants undermined China's obesity fight, scholar says

Texto completo: NEW YORK - China's efforts to keep obesity in check have been undermined from the inside by the food industry, according to newly published research.
A scholar of Chinese society at Harvard University traced how a group funded by Coca-Cola and other food companies enjoyed close ties to Chinese health officials. The group helped tilt the country's obesity fight with the message that exercise matters more than dietary habits, which health advocates say is a way to deflect attention from food's role in fueling obesity.
The International Life Sciences Institute was created in 1978 by a former Coke executive and has 17 branches around the world. In China, its small but influential branch organized obesity conferences focusing on physical activity, with speakers including Coke-funded researchers and a Coke executive, according to the papers published in The BMJ and The Journal of Public Health Policy.
A national exercise program for school children called "Happy 10 Minutes was also modeled after a pet project of the former Coke executive who founded ILSI, the papers say. The concept might have a familiar ring for Americans. Facing criticism over its sugary drinks in the U.S., Coca-Cola in 2013 ran a TV ad showing activities that can burn the "140 happy calories in a can of Coke. The activities included walking a dog, dancing, bowling and sharing a laugh with friends.
In another online ad in the U.S., the company showed people working off the calories in a can of Coke by riding a giant stationary bicycle as carnival music plays. The phrase "Movement is happiness appears on screen toward the end.
Susan Greenhalgh, the papers' author, noted the difficultly in trying to untangle how much of China's emphasis on exercise in recent years can be attributed to ILSI's influence. But she said ILSI's activities highlight the difficulty in assessing how food makers may be skewing public policy around the world.
"There's virtually no research on the incredibly complicated network by which ILSI Global and all its branches have been influencing obesity science, she said.
Chinese health officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, ILSI did not directly address the research findings but said it "does not profess to have been perfect in our 40-year history. It said it has instituted guidelines in recent years to ensure scientific integrity.
"The journey to best-in-class nutrition and food safety science research has been a circuitous one. Not surprisingly, there have been bumps along the way, the statement said.
The food industry has long faced criticism that it plays up the importance of physical activity to minimize the role of food and drinks in poor health. Mike Donahue, former chief spokesman at McDonald's, said such efforts may be seen as nefarious, but are intended to put foods in the context of overall lifestyles.
In 2004, for instance, McDonald's launched a campaign featuring "Adult Happy Meals " with pedometers and events where Ronald McDonald promoted exercise. Donahue said the campaign was partly in anticipation of the documentary "Super Size Me that detailed how a diet of McDonald's led to poor health.
"It's playing offense rather than defense, he said.
In the U.S., prominent politicians and groups often collaborate with food makers on high-profile campaigns to improve public health. Industry efforts aren't always transparent, however, and there has been growing interest in uncovering businesses' hidden influence.
In 2015, The New York Times reported Coca-Cola was funding a nonprofit led by obesity researchers. The Associated Press subsequently obtained emails showing Coke's role in shaping the nonprofit, which the company envisioned would run a political

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King is facing national backlash for his comments on white supremacy, but at least one Kentucky representative isn't ready to formally denounce Iowa's controversial congressman.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King asked in a 56-minute interview with the New York Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
House Democratic leaders moved to rebuke the Iowa Republican in a resolution for disapproval that passed by a 424-1 vote. Two House Democrats — Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois and Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio — have introduced a stronger measure seeking to censure King.
But U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, said in an interview with Fox Business Channel that he's known King for six years, and hasn't heard the Iowa representative utter a racist word.
"In my presence, he's never said anything racist and so I'm not ready to censure a man based on a New York Times article," said Massie, whose 4th Congressional District stretches from Louisville to Ashland.
A spokesman for U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky, said he would support the disapproval measure. He added that the congressman, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, also plans to co-sponsor one of the censure resolutions.
Both Massie and Yarmuth voted for the disapproval resolution, as did King, which some Democrats criticized as a "shallow" response. The measure aid the House ejects white nationalism and white supremacy as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois was the sole lawmaker to oppose the measure, saying the House should take the more serious step of censuring King for his "repugnant and racist behavior."
Other Republicans have denounced King's remarks, and House GOP leaders announced they had voted against giving him any committee assignments.
King has spoken out in the face of this latest controversy, however, saying: "I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define." He also described his party's vote to strip him of committee assignments as an attack on his First Amendment rights.
But this isn't King's first time being in the public eye for comments that have been criticized as racially insensitive or racist. In 2013, he claimed undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children were drug mules.
"For every one who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert," King said at the time.
The House Republican's campaign arm abandoned his re-election bid last year after reports tied King to white nationalist groups. He narrowly won his election in his deep red Iowa district.
King said in a floor speech that the New York Times misrepresented his views.
Massie used his interview Monday evening to also cast doubt on the latest reports about King's remarks. He said the Times has, "printed enough fake news not to take them completely seriously."
The Kentucky congressman went on to suggest that King should have recorded his interview with the newspaper.

Texto completo: Through his work creating, writing and producing television in the 1980s and 1990s, Falsey's shows were praised for mixing eccentric wit and characters with stirring drama that proved to be both critically acclaimed as well as popular.
John Falsey, the co-creator of multiple acclaimed television shows including "Northern Exposure" and "St. Elsewhere" and a University of Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate, died earlier this month in Iowa City.
Falsey died at 4:56 p.m. Jan. 3 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, according to Johnson County Medical Examiner's office administrative director Clayton Schuneman. He died of blunt force trauma to the head, and his death was ruled an accident. He was 67.
Falsey's brother James told The New York Times last weekend that he died due to injuries sustained during a fall at his Iowa City house. They reported that Falsey had been living in town for the past five years and was writing short stories and a novella.
He was also set to executive produce a new revival of his beloved comedy drama "Northern Exposure," as reported by Variety last November.
Through his work creating, writing and producing television in the 1980s and 1990s, Falsey's shows were praised for mixing eccentric wit and characters with stirring drama that proved to be both critically acclaimed as well as popular.
Along with his creative partner Joshua Brand, Falsey won three Emmy Awards. In 1992, he won for Outstanding Drama Series as a producer of "Northern Exposure," along with Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or Special for "I'll Fly Away." He and Brand also won an Emmy for Outstanding Miniseries for "A Year in the Life" in 1987.
Falsey graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1978, during an era of the workshop that featured the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley, science fiction master Joe Haldeman and other Iowa literary luminaries.
Soon after, he started a writing job for "The White Shadow," the Emmy-winning drama starring Ken Howard as a white, former professional basketball player coaching a mostly black city high school.
After "The White Shadow" ended, Falsey and Brand created the medical drama "St. Elsewhere." The show, one of the most acclaimed television dramas of the 20th century, would go on to win 13 Emmy Awards, launched the careers of actors like Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon and showcased one of the most talked-about, and controversial, series finale endings in television history.
The series infamously ended with the titular hospital being shown inside of a snow globe, an awfully meta and literary conclusion that has puzzled audiences since.
TV and film critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote last year on the 30th anniversary of the "St. Elsewhere's" finale that the show "wove in commentary on the process of writing, producing and airing a television show, and sometimes characters would round a corner and come face-to-face with a metaphor for the creative process." The show ran from 1982 to 1988.
In 1990, Falsey and Brand created "Northern Exposure," a seven-time Emmy Award-winning comedy and drama show centering on a recently graduated doctor who set up his practice in the small fictional town of Cicely, Alaska. The show ran from 1990 to 1995.
Both "I'll Fly Away" and "Northern Exposure" were co-produced by David Chase. Four years after the Alaska-set show ended, Chase created HBO's defining drama "The Sopranos." Fellow UI graduates Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess would go on to win numerous Emmy awards for their work on the hit mafia drama.
Falsey later co-created and produced the Steven Spielberg-backed anthology show "Amazing Stories." The last show Falsey produced was "Providence, a family drama that ran from 1999 to 2004.
Falsey was born in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1975.

Texto completo: Backlash continues over congressman's remarks about white nationalism
Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) faced new fallout Tuesday after questioning whether the term "white nationalist" should be offensive as more Republicans called for his resignation, the House voted overwhelmingly to disavow his words, and harsher sanctions loomed.
Together with the GOP's decision Monday to strip him of committee assignments, it marks a stunning castigation for a onetime conservative kingmaker who helped steer his party to hard-line positions on immigration, abortion and other issues.
Before the House voted 424 to 1 Tuesday to condemn the substance of King's recent remarks, a chastened but unapologetic King went to the House floor to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to say that he had been misquoted when he asked a New York Times reporter, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
"There is no tape for this interview that I did. . . . There is no way to go back and listen," said the congressman, who conceded that he might have said the quoted words but challenged how they have been interpreted. "But I can tell you this: That ideology never shows up in my head. I don't know how it could possibly come out of my mouth."
But that explanation came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure - the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after King earned a similar rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The Des Moines Register, in an editorial Tuesday, said King should resign "for the good of Iowa."
King remained defiant later Tuesday in an interview with conservative radio host Ed Martin.
"What are they going to do next?" he said. "After they get done telling me to resign, they'll realize that's not going to happen."
King also took aim at Cheney, saying "you can't ever put her in the category of being a conservative again."
"She's called for my resignation! She's been here two years! What would give her the moral authority or the intellectual judgment to do something like that?" King said.
The resolution passed Tuesday was introduced by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) and mentions King's remarks in its preamble but does not directly rebuke the Iowa congressman himself. The only member opposed was Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.), who is pushing for stronger action.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said - citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue members in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King - who had, for a time, kept a Confederate flag on his desk - noted he came from a family of abolitionists, before calling on his colleagues to support Clyburn's measure.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
Two censure resolutions - one introduced by Rush, another by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) - are set to come up for floor consideration on Wednesday, and Democratic leaders made cursory comments about potentially derailing that effort.
Rush told reporters Tuesday that King's vote to support Clyburn's measure "tells you this resolution is not worth the paper it's written on." He vowed to press forward with censure.
Ryan said he, too, was undeterred. "Steve's saying all the right things," he said. "But there's a long history there."
King's comments to the Times followed a string of remarks over the years that disparaged immigrants and minorities, as well as a seeming embrace of far-right foreign politicians and parties that have been openly hostile to those groups.
Asked why the GOP conference had not taken action against King before, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that he is "a brand new leader" and that he had recently researched King's past comments.
"There is no room for white supremacy," McCarthy said. "We don't take this lightly."
McCarthy condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation: "I think that's up to Steve King."
Shortly before the November election, for instance, King lashed out at the media after The Washington Post reported that he had met with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties after flying to Europe for a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group.
Through the campaign and King's election to a ninth term, House Republican leaders remained silent about King's views. But in recent weeks, Republicans have seen a potential alternative to King after Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced that he will challenge the congressman in the 2020 Republican primary.
King served on the House Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees in the last Congress.
Inside the Democratic caucus, some members on Tuesday expressed wariness about moving too rashly to censure King, while others said they saw censure as an absolute minimum response. The internal politics are tied up in a long history of disciplinary action against members of both parties, as well as a fear of setting a new precedent for punishing lawmakers for their comments outside of the Capitol.
Clyburn said he opted for a narrower resolution to build broad support among both Democrats and Republicans. But he said he would support censure if a measure is presented: "Just because I want to keep my members comfortable doesn't mean I'm uncomfortable" with censure, he said.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) also suggested he might vote for a censure resolution and said
King's conduct "far exceeds" that of the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.).
Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings, which included charges that he improperly used his office to solicit funds and failed to pay taxes on a vacation home. At the time, he pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said. "In my opinion, that is a more dangerous phenomenon than anything Charles B. Rangel did."
Other Democrats pushed for censure as well. Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) said the Clyburn resolution "is just the beginning."
"I don't think there is any place for him or those comments in the United States Congress. . . . We've got to get rid of the climate and to show all the citizens of the United States that that's not who we are as a country."
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said lawmakers should consider referring King to the House Ethics Committee for potential expulsion.
"I think censure is a minimum of what we should be doing, and we should at the very least be in agreement with both caucuses on that," she said. "Folks in my district don't think that any sitting member of Congress should be embracing white supremacy."

Tulsi Gabbard would be first soldier to win presidency since Harry Truman

Texto completo: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard would the first president in a half-century elected while on active military service if she makes it to the White House in next year's election.

The Hawaii Democrat said late last week she will run for president in 2020. If she can navigate what promises to be the most crowded Democratic primary scrum in history and then beat President Trump in November, the Hawaii National Guard major will join a small group of presidents who won the office while still entitled to wear uniform.

Former President Harry S. Truman, a World War I veteran, was an inactive reservist through his presidency. He retired from the Officers’ Reserve Corps at the end of January 1953, the month he completed his only full four-year term as president.

While Truman was the last soldier to win the presidency, Lyndon Johnson — a naval man — was the last serviceman. He resigned as a commander in the Navy Reserves in January 1964, a few months after he took office following the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy.

Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, World War II veteran and NATO supreme commander through the early months of 1952, resigned his commission when he entered politics. The last president to have served in combat was George H.W. Bush, one of the Navy's youngest aviators in World War II, where he served with distinction in the Pacific Theater.

In recent decades, a number of presidents have steered clear of military service, or at least combat duty. Neither President Trump nor former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton fought in Vietnam. Trump received deferments due to bone spurs, Bush signed up for the Air National Guard, and Clinton "worked to avoid the draft, at times cleverly," according to the New York Times.

Heading into the 2020 presidential race, Gabbard stands out with over a decade of service in a political landscape scarce of combat veterans — especially among Democrats. Gabbard could not hold her military position while president, since the commander in chief outranks all other officers. Gabbard, now 37, would likely have either to resign her commission or pause her service.

Though in the younger tier of Democratic presidential candidates, declared or intended, Gabbard would bring to the field considerable experience in uniform and elected office. She became a state legislator in Hawaii at 21 and served one term before deploying with the Hawaii Army National Guard on two tours in the Middle East, one in Kuwait and another in Iraq.

After a short stint on the Honolulu City Council, Gabbard in 2012 won an open House seat, becoming one of the chamber's youngest members. She earned liberal cred in the 2016 presidential race by shunning party favorite Hillary Clinton in favor of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. She resigned in protest from the Democratic National Committee, accusing party leaders of giving Clinton a systematic edge on her way to claiming the nomination over Sanders in a hard-fought race. The Hawaii congresswoman proved a powerful surrogate for the underdog Sanders campaign, highlighting their shared opposition to the Iraq war.

Gabbard is a vocal foe of military intervention. She's frequently said government resources could be used better building up the home front — a sentiment in line in many ways with Trump's foreign policy outlook. She also aligns with the president on pulling troops out of Syria, a move critics say could create a power vacuum the Russians will inevitably take advantage of.

"In short, when it comes to the war against terrorists, I'm a hawk," Gabbard told the Hawaii-Tribune Herald in 2016. "When it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change, I'm a dove."

That approach has raised eyebrows in the foreign policy establishment, as has the glowing coverage she's received in Russian state media.

“Our actions in Syria must be based on strategy, which is based on what our mission actually is. What are we trying to achieve?” Gabbard tweeted early last year. “The neocons/neolibs calling on Trump to attack Syria either don't know what the mission is or are pursuing a mission that is contrary to U.S. interests.”

Gabbard’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Enthusiastic panel spent over $100m on Trump inauguration

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Private donors put up $107 million to usher Donald Trump into office in style two years ago, and it is now clear just how enthusiastically his inaugural committee went to town with it.
There was $10,000 for makeup for 20 aides at an evening inaugural event. There was another $30,000 in per diem payments to dozens of contract staff members, in addition to their fully covered hotel rooms, room service orders, plane tickets and taxi rides, including some to drop off laundry.
The bill from the Trump International Hotel was more than $1.5 million. And there was a documentary, overseen by a close friend of Melania Trump's, that was ultimately abandoned.
The details of the expenditures, gleaned from interviews and from documents reviewed by The New York Times and not previously made public, show that the committee spent heavily on nearly every aspect of the events surrounding the inauguration.
In 72 days, it laid out about $100 million, roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations.
The expansive spending reflected Trump's desire to make a grand entrance, with roughly 20 events around Washington, people familiar with the events said. It also had the hallmarks of previous Trump efforts, such as the campaign, with some Trump-family friends circumventing existing chains of command.
Disclosure of the spending details comes at a time when the inaugural committee is facing legal scrutiny over the donations that funded it.
Inaugural committees are required to document every donation with the Federal Election Commission, and the Trump team's reports are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

GOP leaders remove King from committee positions
House Republican leaders removed Representative Steve King of Iowa from the Judiciary and Agriculture committees Monday night as party officials scrambled to appear tough on racism and contain damage from comments King made to The New York Times questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.
The punishment came on a day when King was denounced by an array of Republican leaders, though not President Trump. Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, suggested King find “another line of work" and Senator Mitt Romney said he should quit. And the House Republicans, in an attempt to be proactive, stripped him of the committee seats in the face of multiple Democratic resolutions to censure King that are being introduced this week.
Those measures would force Republicans to take a stand on the House Democratic majority's attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own.
King has a long history of making racist remarks and insults about immigrants, but has not drawn rebukes from Republican leaders until recently.
In an interview with The Times published last week, King said: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
Speaking to reporters Monday night after the House Republican leadership team acted, California Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, said he was not ruling out supporting a censure or reprimand resolution against King. He said the Republicans are not removing King from the GOP House conference itself, so he can still attend its party meetings, and it was up to Iowans whether King should stay in office.
New York Times
Gillibrand expected to join 2020 race for president
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is expected to move toward launching a 2020 presidential campaign within days by forming an exploratory committee, according to several people familiar with her plans.
The New York Democrat will likely announce her intentions ahead of a trip to Iowa this weekend, one person said. She will be a guest Tuesday night on CBS' "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."
The people spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on Gillibrand's timing. Gillibrand's representatives didn't comment Monday on her plans.
Gillibrand would become the fifth Democrat — and second senator — to jump into a presidential primary that could ultimately feature dozens of candidates. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts along with former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are among those who have joined the race.
While Gillibrand's prominence has grown, she faces a tough battle to capture the attention of Democratic voters in a crowded field that's expected to include multiple women. Several of her potential rivals have spent more time in critical primary states while Gillibrand has visited one — New Hampshire — in October to stump for the Democratic candidate for governor.

Iowa's King loses committee posts

Resumen: King's comments "call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity," McCarthy said, adding: "House Republicans are clear: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced King earlier Monday, saying, "There is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind." Who does that, how does it get done, how do they get by with laying labels like this on people?" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican in the Senate, cast King's remarks and those like them as a blemish on the country and the Republican Party.

WASHINGTON - Veteran Republican Rep. Steve King will be blocked from committee assignments for the next two years after lamenting that white supremacy and white nationalism have become offensive terms.
King, in his ninth term representing Iowa, will not be given committee assignments in the Congress that began this month, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday night. King served on the Agriculture, Small Business and Judiciary committees in the last Congress, and he chaired Judiciary's subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.
McCarthy, R-Calif., called King's remarks "beneath the dignity of the Party of Lincoln and the United States of America."
King's comments "call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity," McCarthy said, adding: "House Republicans are clear: We are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law."
The action by the GOP steering committee came after King and McCarthy met Monday to discuss the remarks on white supremacy.
King called McCarthy's decision to remove him from committees "a political decision that ignores the truth." He vowed to "continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced King earlier Monday, saying, "There is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind."
Meanwhile, House Democrats moved to formally punish King. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the third-ranking House Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, introduced a formal resolution of disapproval late Monday.
Addressing what he called "a tale of two kings," Clyburn said the Iowa lawmaker's remarks were offensive because they embraced evil concepts.
Invoking the memory of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. - whose 90th birthday will be celebrated on Tuesday - Clyburn called on colleagues from both parties "to join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding condemnation be heard."
Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said he will introduce a censure resolution, a more serious action by the House, that Rush said would announce to the world that Congress has no home for "repugnant and racist behavior."
"As with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated," Rush said Monday in a statement that also called on Republicans to strip King of his committee memberships until he apologizes.
A third Democrat, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, introduced a separate censure resolution against King.
"It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, we all have a responsibility to call out Rep. King's hateful and racist comments," Ryan said, noting that the white supremacy comments were not the first time King has made headlines for inappropriate language.
The text of Rush's censure resolution lists more than a dozen examples of King's remarks, beginning with comments in 2006 in which he compared immigrants to livestock and ending with his lamentation in the New York Times last week that white supremacy and white nationalism have become offensive terms.
McConnell, in his statement, said he has "no tolerance" for the positions offered by King, and said "those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work."
One Republican did not join the chorus of criticism. Asked about King's remarks Monday, President Donald Trump said, "I haven't been following it."
King on Friday suggested he's been misunderstood. He said on the House floor that the interview with the Times was in part a "discussion of other terms that have been used, almost always unjustly labeling otherwise innocent people. The word racist, the word Nazi, the word fascist, the phrase white nationalists, the phrase white supremacists."
King said he was only wondering aloud: "How did that offensive language get injected into our political dialogue? Who does that, how does it get done, how do they get by with laying labels like this on people?"
South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican in the Senate, cast King's remarks and those like them as a blemish on the country and the Republican Party.
"When people with opinions similar to King's open their mouths, they damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole," Scott wrote in an op-ed last week in The Washington Post.
"Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism - it is because of our silence when things like this are said," Scott wrote.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also condemned King, telling CNN Monday that King "doesn't have a place in our party" or in Congress and should resign.
King's position in the GOP had been imperiled even before his remarks about white supremacy.
Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, in which King was running, Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, then the head of the GOP campaign committee, issued an extraordinary public denunciation of him.
King has already drawn a primary challenger for the 2020 election: Randy Feenstra, a GOP state senator. Feenstar said Monday, "Sadly, today, the voters and conservative values of our district have lost their seat at the table because of Congressman King's caustic behavior."

Texto completo: One strong argument against the legalization of marijuana is that it is a "gateway drug leading to harder drug use. I have no strong opinion on it but wondered what the literature said. As of right now, it's not, although the science is far from settled. Here is what I found.
Marijuana is not without its harmful effects like legal tobacco use or legal alcohol consumption. It's just the gateway effect doesn't hold up. That's where the use of one substance leads to subsequent use/abuse of a more harmful substance.
So, just because marijuana smokers might be more likely to use cocaine later does not imply that using marijuana causes one to use cocaine.
What it does show is correlation without causation.
The classic causation versus correlation example is that smoking is correlated with alcoholism but doesn't cause alcoholism. That means people who are likely to smoke are also likely to drink alcohol. But smoking does not cause one to drink. What smoking does cause is an increased risk of developing lung cancer.
Robert DuPont, president of the Institute for Behavior and Health, arguing for the gateway theory in the New York Times said people addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin. He further said, "people who use marijuana also consume more, not less, legal and illegal drugs than do people who do not use marijuana.
The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) a part of the National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services, has a different take on it.
They say, "An alternative to the gateway-drug hypothesis is that people who are more vulnerable to drug-taking are simply more likely to start with readily available substances such as marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol, and their subsequent social interactions with others who use drugs increases their chances of trying other drugs. Further research is needed to explore this question.
FactCheck.org reported in 2015, "there is some evidence in favor of a gateway effect, but the scientific community shares no consensus on the issue and there is little evidence on the underlying cause of that effect.
It cites a 1999 report from the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, which said, "In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation into the use of other illicit drugs, it is indeed a gateway drug. However, it does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.
This is not to say marijuana is benign, because it can be harmful.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading national public health center is a federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, and reports multiple adverse effects with marijuana use.
Short-term negative effects include: memory difficulties; anxiety; paranoia; panic attacks; increased probability of psychotic symptoms; hallucinations; decreased reaction time; increased risk of heart attack and stroke; coordination problems (impaired driving); and sexual dysfunction (mostly for males).
Repeated use of cannabis over the long term has been associated with problems that may include: lower IQ (especially when use starts early); poor school or work performance; impaired ability to perform complex tasks; lower life satisfaction; relationship problems; antisocial behavior (stealing, lying); financial difficulties and unemployment; as well as addiction.
The verdict?
Research supports the positive effects of cannabis in treating chronic pain. But it does not conclude using marijuana leads to other drug use or the "gateway effect.
So, is marijuana a gateway drug? I found no settled evidence that it is a causation. Therefore, the "gateway theory cannot be used as proof in opposing the legalization of marijuana unless proven.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Steve King of Iowa, set to be rebuked by the House for his comments in which he questioned why phrases like "white supremacist" are offensive, said on the House floor he intended to vote for the resolution and urged all of his colleagues to do the same.
King, a Republican, said he agreed with Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy. " The resolution invoked King’s comments and condemned such words as “hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States. ”
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country. "
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said that his previous comments had not come across as he had intended them to.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Rev. Martin Luther King, whose birthday would have been Tuesday.
“Now is the time to do right,’’ he said. “This body must speak out against this evil. ”
In a rare move, House Democratic leaders coalesced behind a vote of disapproval put forth by Clyburn, an African-American, a senior Democratic aide said Monday.
A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was previously on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees. The Iowa Republican had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language and we’ve decided that he will not serve on any" committees, GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Tuesday. He said it was up to the Iowa Republican whether he should resign.
But Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. , the No. 3 House Republican went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney has also called on King to resign.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?” King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
On Monday, King was defiant accusing the GOP's McCarthy of making an "unprecedented assault" on his recent to free speech. He also suggested his comments had been misinterpreted.
Rekha Basu: Why did it take national condemnation for Grassley, Ernst, Reynolds to call out King?
"Rep. King’s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday.
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S. C. , the only black Republican in the Senate, wrote a Washington Post op-edtitled: "Why are Republicans accused of racism? Because we’re silent on things like this. "
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet breaking records for the number of women and minorities. At the same time the House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer applauded Republican leaders for their “strong” actions against King Tuesday. “I think they did the right thing,’’ he said. “I think they’re very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party. ”
There were some disagreements among Democrats over how far to go in taking action over King's comments.
Earlier, Hoyer said he would vote for Clyburn’s resolution, but the party was still discussing the censure option, acknowledging that it could open a Pandora’s box. “It is a big deal to be censured,” he said.

Texto completo: Prez denies working for Russia: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests. "I never worked for Russia," Trump said on the South Lawn a day after he didn’t explicitly deny working for Russia in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, though he did call the question "insulting." The New York Times reported last week that the FBI began investigating whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia in 2017, before the special counsel was appointed.
Rep. King off committees: WASHINGTON — A panel of Republican leaders voted unanimously Monday to keep Rep. Steve King of Iowa off of House committees, a firm rebuke to an influential opponent of illegal immigration who sparked outrage last week after openly questioning whether the term "white supremacist" was offensive. King, who was elected to a ninth term in November, served on the House Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees in the last Congress. The decision to effectively strip him of those posts. In a statement, King wrote that the decision "is a political decision that ignores the truth." House Democrats could bring up a measure condemning King as soon as today.
UPS hostage suspect killed: LOGAN TOWNSHIP, N.J. — An armed man who entered a UPS processing facility Monday morning and held two women hostage for several hours was shot and killed by police as he left the building with the women, authorities said. Several officers fired at William Owens, 39, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, the state attorney general’s office said in a news release that did not detail the situation or explain why the suspect was shot. Owens had entered the business at about 8:45 a.m. and fired shots, which did not strike anyone, before taking the women to a room and barricading himself inside with them, authorities said. Officials believe that Owens had a prior relationship with one of the hostages, Gloucester County Prosecutor Charles Fiore said. The women escaped without serious injuries after the standoff in Logan Township, about 20 miles south of Philadelphia, Fiore said.
Polish mayor dies of wounds: WARSAW, Poland — The popular mayor of Poland’s port city of Gdansk died Monday after being stabbed over the weekend at a charity event. Pawel Admowicz was 53.
Birth control rules halted in U.S.: A Pennsylvania district court judge on Monday issued a nationwide injunction pausing Trump administration rules that would restrict the ability of some women to get birth control at no charge because their employers object on religious or moral grounds. The ruling that paused the new policy just as it was slated to take effect came less than 24 hours after a California judge issued a stay that was limited to Illinois, 12 other states and Washington, D.C.
FAA unveils drone rules: The Federal Aviation Administration outlined draft rules Monday that would let drone operators fly small drones over crowds and at night without a special waiver from current rules. It’s not clear how long it might be before the FAA’s easing goes into effect. The FAA said it won’t take final action until it finishes another regulation regarding remote identification of small drones, which analysts say could be years away.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup:
March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival. She is the author of the critically-acclaimed 2018 best-seller "The Library Book," a love letter to libraries that doubles as a true crime exploration of the unsolved 1986 fire that damaged the Los Angeles Public Library. Orlean's 1998 nonfiction classic, "The Orchid Thief," was adapted into a feature film, "Adaptation."
April 18: Laurie Frankel. She's the author of the best-selling 2017 novel "This is How It Always Is," which tells the story of a family struggling with the challenges of raising a transgender child. The story is fiction, but the author is the mother of a transgender child herself. The book was chosen as a Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick in fall 2018.
April 22: Chigozie Obioma. The Nigerian-born author burst onto the literary scene in 2015 with his debut novel, "The Fishermen," which won multiple national and international awards — including an NAACP Image Award — and was a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. That same year he was named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. His much-anticipated second novel, "An Orchestra of Minorities" is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" written in the style of the Nigerian Igbo tradition.
May 2: Sarah Smarsh. Journalist, educator and author Sarah Smarsh's debut book, "Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth," was an instant best-seller upon release in 2018. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and National Book Award. Heartland was named one of the best books of 2018 by NPR, Amazon, Audible, Publisher's Weekly and more. The book examines America's historic economic inequality and tells the story of her upbringing among the working poor of rural Kansas.

Texto completo: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he pressed Saudi Arabia's crown prince on Monday on a range of thorny issues -- including war, murder, diplomatic rifts and human rights abuses -- that have weakened the American-Saudi alliance and increased tensions among Arab nations.
At the same time, Mr. Pompeo reaffirmed the two nations' shared goal of opposing Iranian policies in the Middle East.
"I want to talk to you about a couple of places we've been," Mr. Pompeo told Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, at the start of their morning meeting at the royal palace. "We think we learned a lot along the way that will be important going forward."
Prince Mohammed, apparently sensing the delicate political situation, said, "We'll try to add more positivity to your trip, as much as we can. And we'll try to cooperate more."
Mr. Pompeo has been traveling through the Arab world since leaving Washington on Jan. 7, and Saudi Arabia is the most important stop on the trip.
At each stop, Mr. Pompeo has talked about the importance of countering Iran, a country whose Shiite Muslim government is often at odds with the Sunni Muslim rulers of many nations in the region.
"We certainly talked about our effort to counter Iranian malign influence," Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference at the airport before flying to Oman, his final stop.
Saudi Arabia is Iran's main rival and an old American ally -- as well as the United States' biggest buyer of arms -- though Prince Mohammed's actions are roiling the region and unsettling the kingdom's relationship with the United States.
On Monday morning, Mr. Pompeo left Al Faisaliah Hotel in central Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a list of problems to discuss with Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman.
The list included the killing by Saudi agents in October of Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken Saudi dissident who lived in Virginia; the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, a crucial military partner of the United States; and the Saudi-led air war against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has resulted in the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with many Yemenis starving.
The United States Embassy in Riyadh wrote on Twitter that Mr. Pompeo and Prince Mohammed had agreed Monday on the "need for de-escalation and adherence" to agreements reached at peace talks in Sweden over the Yemen war.
Mr. Pompeo insisted on upholding the cease-fire and pullback of forces in the port city of Hudaydah, the embassy said. "A comprehensive political solution is the only way to end the conflict," it said.
Human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia are also under the international spotlight. On Sunday, The New York Times published an Op-Ed by Alia al-Houthlal, the sister of a women's rights activist imprisoned in Riyadh, Loujain al-Houthlal, beseeching Mr. Pompeo to ask Prince Mohammed for the release of her sister.
Ms. Houthlal wrote that her sister had been tortured in prison, and that a close associate of the prince, Saud al-Qahtani, who has been implicated in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, was present at several torture sessions.
Over the weekend, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman who had fled the kingdom, arrived in Canada after being granted asylum there.
She has talked of the plight of women in Saudi Arabia and the oppressive system of male guardianship over women, despite Prince Mohammed's promotion of more liberal social policies in some areas.
Mr. Pompeo said he had spoken to Prince Mohammed about concerns over the imprisonment of women's rights activists. "Their commitment was that the process, the lawful judicial process here, would take place," he said. "They understand the concerns that some have."
But many of the most prominent activists being held have not been charged with any crimes, making it unclear what process Mr. Pompeo was referring to. Critics also question the independence of the judiciary in Saudi Arabia, one of the world's few absolute monarchies, where few trials are open to the public or the news media.
Amid the growing criticism of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump has voiced his backing of Prince Mohammed, 33, who has secured power in the kingdom by ousting his rivals, including detaining other members of the royal family in the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh.
But many other American officials, including in the State Department, Pentagon, C.I.A. and Congress, have been more circumspect and increasingly view the prince as an unreliable partner.
The visit with Prince Mohammed on Monday was the first for Mr. Pompeo since an emergency trip in October, as the diplomatic crisis over the murder of Mr. Khashoggi was ballooning. In his previous visit, Mr. Pompeo flew to Riyadh and posed for photographs in which he shook hands with the prince and smiled, drawing intense criticism for the images of bonhomie.
Since then, Mr. Pompeo has had regular calls with the prince, said a former American official.
Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a Saudi hit team while visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, Turkish officials have said. The C.I.A. assessed that Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing.
President Trump has declined to endorse that finding and has said the United States would continue its relationship with Saudi Arabia and with the prince, who is close to Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and main Middle East adviser.
Mr. Pompeo said at the Monday news conference that both the prince and his father, King Salman, acknowledged in separate meetings at the palace that the Saudi government needed to show accountability for the murder. Yet Mr. Pompeo declined to answer a question about how his demands square with the C.I.A.'s conclusion that Prince Mohammed was behind the assassination.
Middle East experts working in the State Department have concluded that the Saudis have not met the threshold of accountability yet.
A Saudi court has begun trial proceedings for 11 suspects in the Khashoggi case, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of them. In October, the government said it had arrested 18 people, and it is unclear what has happened to the other seven.
The Saudi government has also removed a few senior officials from their posts, including Mr. Qahtani, the close associate of the prince who directed the kingdom's social media efforts.
When pressed by a reporter about Prince Mohammed's conduct, Mr. Pompeo ultimately said that Saudi Arabia's "leaders are going to act in their country's interests."
"That's their obligation, the same way mine is to act in America's best interests," he said.
Given the darkening views on Saudi Arabia in the West, it will be difficult for the Trump administration to avoid scrutiny of the relationship, and for Prince Mohammed to overhaul his image, said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
"There's a narrative that a dictatorship is emerging where there was once a monarchy," he said. "This is a very, very damaging narrative."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

RNC calls on Pelosi to follow GOP's Steve King rebuke with 'action' against Democrats with Louis Farrakhan ties

Texto completo: Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel coupled praise of House Republicans for voting to remove Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from his committee assignments Monday with a call for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action against Democrats who have met with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.

In a tweet, McDaniel said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., “made the right decision” to strip King of his committee assignments in response to allegations that he showed support for white supremacy.

“There’s no place for white supremacy in our country & it’s totally inconsistent with the Republican Party,” McDaniel tweeted. “I hope Nancy Pelosi also takes action against all the Democrats who continue to associate with prominent anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.”

King has been the subject of controversy after an interview with the New York Times, where King was quoted as saying: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? ... Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"

While critics contended that King was questioning when the terms had become offensive, King defended himself on Monday with a statement that said he was only referring to Western civilization and not “any previously stated evil ideology.”

“Clearly, I was only referencing Western Civilization classes. No one ever sat in a class listening to the merits of of white nationalism and white supremacy," King said.

A number of Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and current lawmakers, have faced controversy for their interactions with Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam group who has made controversial comments over the years. For instance, last year for a Saviours’ Day 2018 address, he said “the powerful Jews are my enemy” and “white folks are going down.”

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney declared in no uncertain terms Monday that Rep. Steve King should resign for his controversial comments about white supremacy.

“I think he ought to step aside and I think Congress ought to make it very clear he has no place there," Romney, R-Utah, told CNN.

Romney is the latest prominent GOP lawmaker to join a bipartisan chorus of condemnation of King, R-Iowa, after he spoke with the New York Times last week and asked why the phrases "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" have become "offensive."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., issued a stern rebuke of King earlier in the day, saying "If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work."

King has backtracked on his comments amid intensifying backlash. “I reject white nationalism. I reject white supremacy. It's not part of any of my ideology. I reject anyone who carries that ideology," he told NBC News.

While debate about King's future in the Republican Party and Congress plays out this week, including possible censure, President Trump has been mum on the issue. "I don't — I haven't been following it. I really haven't been following it," he said Monday when asked by reporters at the White House.

Enthusiastic panel spent over $100m on Trump inauguration

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Private donors put up $107 million to usher Donald Trump into office in style two years ago, and it is now clear just how enthusiastically his inaugural committee went to town with it.
There was $10,000 for makeup for 20 aides at an evening inaugural event. There was another $30,000 in per diem payments to dozens of contract staff members, in addition to their fully covered hotel rooms, room service orders, plane tickets and taxi rides, including some to drop off laundry.
The bill from the Trump International Hotel was more than $1.5 million. And there was a documentary, overseen by a close friend of Melania Trump's, that was ultimately abandoned.
The details of the expenditures, gleaned from interviews and from documents reviewed by The New York Times and not previously made public, show that the committee spent heavily on nearly every aspect of the events surrounding the inauguration.
In 72 days, it laid out about $100 million, roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations.
The expansive spending reflected Trump's desire to make a grand entrance, with roughly 20 events around Washington, people familiar with the events said. It also had the hallmarks of previous Trump efforts, such as the campaign, with some Trump-family friends circumventing existing chains of command.
Disclosure of the spending details comes at a time when the inaugural committee is facing legal scrutiny over the donations that funded it.
Inaugural committees are required to document every donation with the Federal Election Commission, and the Trump team's reports are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
New York Times
GOP leaders remove King from committee positions
House Republican leaders removed Representative Steve King of Iowa from the Judiciary and Agriculture committees Monday night as party officials scrambled to appear tough on racism and contain damage from comments King made to The New York Times questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.
The punishment came on a day when King was denounced by an array of Republican leaders, though not President Trump. Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, suggested King find “another line of work" and Senator Mitt Romney said he should quit. And the House Republicans, in an attempt to be proactive, stripped him of the committee seats in the face of multiple Democratic resolutions to censure King that are being introduced this week.
Those measures would force Republicans to take a stand on the House Democratic majority's attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own.
King has a long history of making racist remarks and insults about immigrants, but has not drawn rebukes from Republican leaders until recently.
In an interview with The Times published last week, King said: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
Speaking to reporters Monday night after the House Republican leadership team acted, California Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, said he was not ruling out supporting a censure or reprimand resolution against King. He said the Republicans are not removing King from the GOP House conference itself, so he can still attend its party meetings, and it was up to Iowans whether King should stay in office.
New York Times
Gillibrand expected to join 2020 race for president
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is expected to move toward launching a 2020 presidential campaign within days by forming an exploratory committee, according to several people familiar with her plans.
The New York Democrat will likely announce her intentions ahead of a trip to Iowa this weekend, one person said. She will be a guest Tuesday night on CBS' "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."
The people spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on Gillibrand's timing. Gillibrand's representatives didn't comment Monday on her plans.
Gillibrand would become the fifth Democrat — and second senator — to jump into a presidential primary that could ultimately feature dozens of candidates. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts along with former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are among those who have joined the race.
While Gillibrand's prominence has grown, she faces a tough battle to capture the attention of Democratic voters in a crowded field that's expected to include multiple women. Several of her potential rivals have spent more time in critical primary states while Gillibrand has visited one — New Hampshire — in October to stump for the Democratic candidate for governor.

“Let’s set a world record together and get the most liked post on Instagram,” the post, which has over 29.6 million likes as of Monday morning, reads. “Beating the current world record held by Kylie Jenner (18 million)! We got this.”
The photo, posted on Jan. 4 by user world_record_egg, is the only photo on the account. Who’s behind the mysterious egg photo and how exactly the post was so well-received remains unclear.
Though a second act may be coming as the account wrote on Instagram that “it doesn’t end here,” and that “we’re only just getting started,” according to The New York Times.
Jenner’s post from February announcing the birth of her daughter shows the baby’s little hand wrapped around her mom’s thumb. It garnered over 18 million likes.
The comments on that post have been taken over by users posting images of eggs or egg emojis.
After she learned she was bumped from the top, Jenner posted a video of herself cracking an egg with the caption: “Take that little egg.”

Texto completo: A hedge fund-backed chain that is aiming for a hostile takeover of Gannett, which owns USA TODAY and 109 local media properties, placed too low of a value on the company and is betting on a level of cost cutting that may be unrealistic, analysts said Monday.
Michael Kupinski, director of research at Noble Capital Markets in Boca Raton, Florida, said most newspapers, after years of staff reductions across the industry, "are running pretty lean. "
He predicted that Gannett's board will decline the offer.
MNG Enterprises, which also operates as Digital First Media, is proposing to buy Gannett for $12 a share. That would be a 23 percent premium above Friday's closing price of $9. 75 a share. Gannett (GCI) shares on Monday closed up 21 percent, or $2. 07, at $11. 82.
MNG, majority owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, owns about 200 publications, including newspapers such as The Denver Post, The Mercury News of San Jose, California, the Los Angeles Daily News and the Boston Herald. The company has also gained a reputation for deep cost cuts and extensive layoffs in newsrooms.
A plan to prune Gannett for additional return on investment may be faulty, Kupinski said.
“I guess this particular firm is notorious for going in and slashing costs," he said. "I really don’t view Gannett as being one of the companies that has bloated staffing or anything like that. There might be an opportunity to consolidate maybe some facilities but they were moving along that direction anyway. ”
Paul Caminiti, a spokesperson for MNG, said it "has extensive operational experience and a successful track record in the newspaper industry, enabling us to run newspapers profitability and sustainable so that they can continue to serve their local communities. ”
Subsequent bidders could surpass the MNG/Digital First offer because "it would be below what I would expect the company to achieve," Kupinski said. "We have a $15 price target" on Gannett stock.
Huber Research analysts Douglas Arthur and Craig Huber, in a note to clients Monday, said any offer for Gannett should be at least $14 a share.
The two analysts described the takeover attempt as "opportunistic given the stock was battered during the market’s December sell-off and the CEO as well as head of digital sales have both announced they are leaving (CEO is retiring). Our bottom line is that the proposed price is not high enough. "
Gannett CEO Robert Dickey announced his retirement in December. Sharon Rowlands, who led USA TODAY Network Marketing Solutions, is leaving the company to become CEO of web. com.
Gannett said MNG/Digital First did not approach the company prior to Monday. That is an unusual strategy and one that would not only be more costly, but would be less likely to be effective, said Morton Pierce, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer with the firm of White & Case in New York City.
“If I approach you and punch you in the mouth and then say, ‘Let’s be friends,’ it’s less likely to work than if I just come up and talk to you,” Pierce said.
This first bid may not be the last and shareholders could be wooed, he said.
“If someone’s paying you cash, whether they’re the nicest people in the world or the worst SOBs, their cash is the same,” Pierce said.
Since MNG/Digital First is privately held, financial details are hard to collect. But the chain achieved a 17 percent operating margin for fiscal 2017, the highest among publishing chains, said Ken Doctor, an analyst who writes about the media business on his website, Newsonomics. com.
Other major publishers such as The New York Times Co. and Gannett posted margins of less than 10 percent, according to Doctor. He said company financials obtained confidentially found that much of Digital First's profit was driven by its Colorado newspapers and its Bay Area News Group.
Two months ago, Gannett reduced its full-year 2018 revenue forecast after digital advertising and marketing services revenue growth slowed, resulting in a 4 percent dip in total operating revenue for the third quarter. The company revised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $2. 9 billion to $2. 94 billion, compared to the previous range of $2. 95 billion to $3 billion. Wall Street analysts now expect Gannett to post full year-revenue of $2. 9 billion, down 6. 5 percent from $3. 1 billion a year ago, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Declining print circulation and advertising revenue has led newspaper groups to seek protection through consolidation. Gannett itself has bolstered its size in 2016 by adding the Journal Media Group. Its 15 media properties included the Journal Sentinel in Milwaukee, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee, and The Record in Bergen County, N. J.
"Alden has a controversial reputation in the newspaper business and is known for aggressively slashing staff (media sources refer to the strategy as strip-mining), selling off real estate and otherwise attempting to seemingly run papers until the very last iota of cash flow has been squeezed from it," the Huber Research analysts wrote. "We believe, while Underweight, (Gannett) is on the right path with its digital growth push and legacy cost cuts. "

Trump-Russia reports spur questions by Dems; GOP allies, White House defend high secrecy with Putin

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked - I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader - to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark - was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland - but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "

Lab revokes honorary titles for Nobel Prize winner James Watson after repeated racist comments

Resumen: James Watson, who helped discover DNA, lost his titles after making what the Cold Spring Harbor Lab called "reprehensible" comments in documentary.

Texto completo: Nobel Prize-winning scientist James Watson has been stripped of his honorary titles at the laboratory he once led after doubling down on racist comments.
Watson, who discovered DNA’s double helix structure alongside Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin in the 1950s, said that genes cause a difference on IQ tests between blacks and whites, in a recent PBS documentary "American Masters: Decoding Watson. "
The leaders of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island said in a statement his comments were “reprehensible, unsupported by science. ”
This isn't Watson’s first controversial comment about race. He lost his position as chancellor at the lab in 2007 after he told the Sunday Times he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa" because "all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really. "
He added that although he wished everyone were equal, “people who have to deal with black employees find this not true. ”
His comments in the documentary “effectively reverse the written apology and retraction Dr. Watson made in 2007,” the lab’s statement read. As a result, the lab stripped him of his titles of Chancellor Emeritus, Oliver R. Grace Professor Emeritus and Honorary Trustee.
Watson became the first person to sell his Nobel Prize in 2014 as part of an attempt to restore his reputation, the New York Times reported.
His son Rufus told the Associated Press that his 90-year-old father is recovering at home from a car crash in October and has “very minimal” awareness of his surroundings.
“My dad’s statements might make him out to be a bigot and discriminatory,” he said. "They just represent his rather narrow interpretation of genetic destiny. ”

Texto completo: The top Republican in the House vowed Sunday that "action will be taken" after Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King's recent comment about white supremacy and white nationalism.
"That language has no place in America," California GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Mr. King has faced criticism after he apparently told The New York Times that he thought it was wrong white nationalism and white supremacy were considered offensive.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -how did that language become offensive?" Mr. King said.
He later said he is "simply a nationalist" and condemned "anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology" of white nationalism and white supremacy.
R. Kelly permit denied
R. Kelly won't be bringing any bump and grind to the Illinois State Fairgrounds in April after the state denied a permit application for an event to be hosted by the singer in April.
"That application was under review until Thursday, at which point Illinois Dept. of Agriculture (IDOA) staff contacted the organizer to let them know their application would not be approved," said Denise Albert, the department's spokeswoman. "Unfortunately, we cannot control when organizers start promoting an event - there was never a signed agreement to host the event at the Illinois State Fairgrounds, only an application."
The fact that Mr. Kelly is the subject of intensified criticism following the docuseries "Surviving R. Kelly" played into the Department of Agriculture's decision, Ms. Albert said.
"The criteria they didn't meet is security concerns based on recent protests," she said.
For years, the singer has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, including child pornography, giving women sexually transmitted diseases and having relationships with underage girls, but Mr. Kelly has never been convicted on the charges.
The three-night Lifetime series "Surviving R. Kelly," which aired earlier this month, put many of these accusations back in the spotlight. The series revisits the allegations via interviews with Mr. Kelly's accusers, witnesses and those close to the singer.
Through his attorney, Steve Greenberg, Mr. Kelly denied the accusations against him, with Mr. Greenberg telling CNN his client "has done nothing wrong."
The series also appears to have renewed prosecutors' interest in the allegations, with the Cook County, Ill., state's attorney urging alleged victims to come forward and the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney saying his office is investigating the singer.
'Mooch' on'Big Brother'
Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci will be on this season of "Celebrity Big Brother" on CBS, the second straight year that the reality show has featured a prominent member of Donald Trump's White House.
The CBS announcement comes a year after Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the "Apprentice" alum and former White House aide, appeared on the show.
Mr. Scaramucci, the financier-turned-Trump whisperer, was infamously the White House's communications director for a whirlwind 11 days in July 2017. "The Mooch" was ousted after giving an aggressively vulgar interview to The New Yorker about fellow officials Reince Priebus and Steven Bannon.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked - I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader - to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark - was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland - but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's efforts to hide his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and new details about the F.B.I. inquiry into his ties to Moscow have intensified debate over his relationship with Russia, adding fuel to Democrats' budding investigations of his presidency and potentially setting up a clash between the White House and Congress.
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who now leads the Intelligence Committee as part of the new Democratic House majority, implored his Republican colleagues Sunday to support his effort to obtain notes or testimony from the interpreter in one of the private meetings between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.
"Will they join us now?" Mr. Schiff wrote on Twitter. "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?"'
The administration appears unlikely to acquiesce to such a demand without a fight.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly withheld details of his conversations with Mr. Putin, according to current and former American officials, a practice that has left officials blind to the dynamic between the two leaders and intensified questions within the administration over the president's actions.
That development, first reported by The Washington Post, followed a report in The New York Times that the F.B.I. had earlier begun a counterintelligence investigation on Mr. Trump to see whether he had been influenced by Russia when he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017.
On Sunday, congressional Democrats said the steps Mr. Trump took to keep his conversations secret brought forth uncomfortable questions about the relations between the two men and why the American president echoed some of Mr. Putin's positions.
"Why is he so chummy with Vladimir Putin, this man who is a former K.G.B. agent, never been a friend to the United States, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world and tries his damnedest to undermine our elections?" Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on ABC's "This Week." "Why is this President Trump's best buddy? I don't get it."
Mr. Trump went so far as to take the notes from the interpreter who worked with him during a private meeting with Mr. Putin at the 2017 Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany.
A former senior administration official said a number of top figures in the administration sought in the hours and days after the meeting to find out details of what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had discussed. But Mr. Trump waved off their queries, leaving the officials to rely solely on a brief readout that Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state at the time, had provided to the news media, according to the former official.
Several administration officials asked the interpreter what had been discussed. But the interpreter told them that the president had taken the notes after the meeting, and had instructed the translator not to discuss the meeting, the former official said.
Last year both House and Senate Democrats called on Mr. Trump's interpreters to testify on the president's meetings with Mr. Putin, including the leaders' July summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Trump's news conference in Helsinki, in which he questioned his own intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election, prompted bipartisan criticism.
Mr. Trump's failure to allow other officials into the room or share notes of the meeting has become something of a Rorschach test inside the government.
For opponents of the president, there are no innocent explanations for Mr. Trump's actions, which are possible evidence that Mr. Trump has colluded with Russia, a question at the heart of the special counsel inquiry. For supporters, Mr. Trump's actions are evidence that he must go to extreme lengths to prevent leaks and is a nontraditional politician pursuing new approaches to old problems.
Republicans defended Mr. Trump on Sunday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS's "Face the Nation" that any notion the president was a threat to American security "is absolutely ludicrous."
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, defended Mr. Trump's choice to talk privately with Mr. Putin or other leaders.
"I know what the president likes to do," Mr. McCarthy said on "Face the Nation." "He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship, like he does with other world leaders around."
The F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump's ties to Russia was taken over by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. While it is not clear what Mr. Mueller has done with the investigation, there are some clues that he has pursued at least parts of it.
While many of the questions Mr. Mueller submitted to Mr. Trump were focused on accusations of obstruction of justice against the president, others had to do with the president's relationship with Russia.
Mr. Mueller asked Mr. Trump whether he had any discussions during the campaign about any meetings with Mr. Putin and whether he spoke to others about American sanctions against Russia.
While Mr. Trump did not answer Mr. Mueller's questions about obstruction, he did answer the questions about Russia, although what the president said is not known.
The revelation about the earlier F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation prompted Republicans to renew their criticism of the bureau.
Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and fierce defender of Mr. Trump, told Fox News he was going to ask Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, if the bureau had begun a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Graham said there should be checks inside the bureau to prevent such an investigation.
"I find it astonishing, and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the F.B.I.," Mr. Graham said. "I don't trust them as far as I throw them."
As Democrats press ahead in their investigation of Mr. Trump's meetings with Mr. Putin, it is not clear what information they will be able to extract from the White House.
There are no reports inside the government on what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed in their meetings, current and former officials said.
Without official detailed notes about Mr. Trump's conversations, senior officials in the administration have had to rely on intelligence reports about what the Russians were saying to one another after the meeting. There are limits to what officials could glean from the intelligence, current and former officials said. And the Russians could hardly be considered reliable narrators, even with one another.
While that frustrated some in the government, the former senior administration official said he was not unsympathetic to Mr. Trump's predicament. The official said the president feared that whatever he said to Mr. Putin would be twisted by critics.
But because access to meetings and transcripts was tightened after early leaks, some officials believed Mr. Trump's decision to take the notes was too extreme and raised questions about what he was trying to keep private, the former official said.

Texto completo: For the Valley News
Maybe I’ve gotten too big for my britches. It’s been 50 years since I graduated from Ithaca College and I don’t even read the alumni magazine anymore. For a while, in the 1980s, rumor had it that Ithaca had “made” Playboy’s list of “Best Party Schools.” But that was just a rumor. It is currently way down, at No. 23, on a list of top New York party schools.
But that was the way I had come to think about Ithaca over the years: as a party school that never dared to rock the intellectual or political boat. Its most famous graduate is the host of ABC’s World News Tonight — and speaks so fast you’d think the world is ending.
I guess I had gone onto bigger and better things, or so I convinced myself: After Ithaca, I earned degrees from a huge state university in 1972, a great Ivy League university in 1980 and, finally, an elite sub-Ivy college in 1997. I hadn’t seen the name Ithaca College for decades, except on alumni propaganda, until 2016.
That’s when it showed up on the front page of The New York Times.
The college’s president, Tom Rochon, had been hounded into resigning after being accused by students of insensitivity to racial issues. Maybe Ithaca was at last throwing off its party school reputation and embracing the great political issues of the day.
I had created the college’s first teach-in 50 years ago, in the 1968-69 school year, on the same topic that propelled the college to the front page of the Times: Racism. (Actually, I stole the idea from Cornell University. That Ivy League school, which sits on a hill opposite from Ithaca College, had shut down for a weeklong “Teach-in on Racism” in response to its own paralyzing race-related crisis. But that’s another story.)
So it seemed a bit late to me, in 2016, after 50 years of silence, for Ithaca College suddenly to decide to deal with the issue of racism.
False alarm. After raising the racism banner, Ithaca faded back into oblivion — in the news, and in my mind, for two more years.
That’s when I learned about Shirley Collado, Ithaca’s new president and the first person of color to be appointed to that post. What an eye opener! Then Google told me that The Ithacan, the college’s otherwise ho-hum student newspaper, had reported in January 2018 that Collado had pleaded no contest in 2001 to a sexual assault charge during the time she was training as a trauma therapist at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington.
That doesn’t sound like the timid little party college I had been ignoring for decades. Read on, thought I.
Bureaucracies and presidents, I believe, traditionally engage in “benign neglect and intransigent equivocation,” a phrase I invented decades ago to describe how many administrators behave. It means ignore accusations, muddy the waters with meaningless words and hope the problem will go away. But during her interviews for the Ithaca post, instead of a covering up or issuing denials, Collado responded openly and frankly to the search committee’s questions about why she pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor charge of putting her hand on a patient’s body outside of her clothing.
Collado, who was 28 at the time of the incident, denied allegations that she had a sexual or romantic relationship with the patient, and said the woman was no longer her patient during the short time she stayed in her home.
Collado said she was emotionally vulnerable at the time because her first husband had recently committed suicide, and she granted that, in retrospect, her friendship with a former patient had been a mistake based on that vulnerability.
In other words, she is human.
She didn’t have the money to fight the charge, so she did what many people do in those circumstances — she pleaded no contest, which allowed her to maintain her innocence while ending the proceedings. She received a 30-day suspended sentence, and 18 months of probation.
All of this Collado has recounted publicly.
Wow. In one stroke, my humble little college was suddenly involved in almost all of the major controversies of 2018: gender fluidity, race and gender discrimination, sexual assault, gay relationships, justice and money, power dynamics in professional relationships, and the First Amendment.
While I feel terribly for Collado’s former patient and what she went through, to tell the truth, I’m proud of little Ithaca College and the courageous behavior of its faculty, its board of trustees and its tiny student newspaper: No cover-up; face the problem squarely; acknowledge redemptive behavior; offer forgiveness; move on.
And I’m a bit embarrassed that I got so big for my britches that I ignored my first alma mater for two decades.
Did I mention that when I left Ithaca in 1969, I went to graduate school in Ohio at a university named Kent State? Within six months, on May 4, 1970, it became the most notorious university in the world after Ohio National Guardsmen shot into a crowd of student demonstrators, killing four and wounding nine others.
Kent State’s board of trustees and the Ohio courts then adopted a strategy quite unlike that taken by Ithaca College: Blame others; muddy or cover-up the facts; protect institutions; let decades pass; and then, and only then, reluctantly acknowledge reality. History will judge how that approach worked out for Kent State.
Maybe The Ithacan, Ithaca College’s gutsy little student newspaper, is reminding us all of something we need to remember: The mission of the Academy — even a former party school — is the pursuit of truth.
Is half a century too late for this prodigal alumnus to resize his pants and say he’s proud to reclaim his status as a graduate of Ithaca College?

Texto completo: Today is the 13th day of 2019. There are 352 days left in the year.
Today's highlight in history: On Jan. 13, 1982, an Air Florida 737 crashed into Washington, D.C.'s 14th Street Bridge and fell into the Potomac River while trying to take off during a snowstorm, killing 78 people; four passengers and a flight attendant survived.
On this date:
In 1794, President George Washington approved a measure adding two stars and two stripes to the American flag, following the admission of Vermont and Kentucky to the Union. (The number of stripes was later reduced to the original 13.)
In 1915, a magnitude-7 earthquake centered in Avezzano, Italy, claimed some 30,000 lives.
In 1941, a law went into effect granting Puerto Ricans U.S. birthright citizenship. Novelist and poet James Joyce died in Zurich, Switzerland, less than a month before his 59th birthday.
In 1962, comedian Ernie Kovacs died in a car crash in west Los Angeles 10 days before his 43rd birthday.
In 1964, Roman Catholic Bishop Karol Wojtyla (the future Pope John Paul II) was appointed archbishop of Krakow, Poland, by Pope Paul VI.
In 1968, country singer Johnny Cash performed and recorded a pair of shows at Folsom State Prison in California; material from the concerts was released as an album by Columbia Records under the title "Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison," which proved a hit.
In 1978, former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey died in Waverly, Minn., at age 66.
In 1990, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia became the nation's first elected black governor as he took the oath of office in Richmond.
In 1992, Japan apologized for forcing tens of thousands of Korean women to serve as sex slaves for its soldiers during World War II, citing newly uncovered documents that showed the Japanese army had had a role in abducting the so-called "comfort women."
In 1997, seven black soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II valor; the lone survivor of the group, former Lt. Vernon Baker, received his medal from President Bill Clinton at the White House.
In 2000, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates stepped aside as chief executive and promoted Steve Ballmer, the company president, to the position.
In 2012, the Italian luxury liner Costa Concordia ran aground off the Tuscan island of Giglio and flipped onto its side; 32 people were killed.
Ten years ago: President-elect Barack Obama's nominee for secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, vowed during her Senate confirmation hearing to revitalize the mission of diplomacy in U.S. foreign policy. Obama's choice to run the Treasury Department, Timothy Geithner, disclosed that he had failed to pay $34,000 in taxes from 2001 to 2004. U.S. marshals apprehended Marcus Schrenker, 38, in North Florida days after the businessman and amateur daredevil pilot apparently tried to fake his own death in a plane crash. (Schrenker was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, on top of four years in federal prison on charges stemming from the plane crash.) Actor-director Patrick McGoohan died in Los Angeles at age 80. Author Hortense Calisher died in New York at age 97.
Five years ago: A shooting at a Wesley Chapel, Fla., movie theater left Chad Oulson, 43, dead; retired Tampa police Capt. Curtis Reeves, 71, is accused of killing Oulson during what authorities said was an argument over Oulson's texting just before a showing of the movie "Lone Survivor." (He is still awaiting trial; a judge has rejected a "stand-your-ground" defense.) Two Fullerton, Calif., police officers who were videotaped in a violent struggle with a homeless man, Kelly Thomas, during an arrest were acquitted by a jury in Santa Ana of killing him.
One year ago: A false alarm that warned of a ballistic missile headed for Hawaii sent the islands into a panic, with people abandoning cars on a highway and preparing to flee their homes; officials apologized and said the alert was sent when someone hit the wrong button during a shift change. Two Army captains who met at West Point, Daniel Hall and Vincent Franchino, returned there to be married, in what The New York Times said was believed to be the first same-sex marriage of active-duty personnel at the military academy.
Caption: A U.S. flag with 15 stripes and 15 stars flies in Baltimore during a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the United States' national anthem. The addition of two stripes was approved on this date in 1794, though the number was later reduced back to 13.

A brief guide to Rep. Steve King’s ‘long history of racist statements’

Texto completo: With nearly two decades of Steven Arnold King as a national political figure, the American public has become well-acquainted with the Groundhog Day-like parameters of the Steve King news cycle.
1. King, R-Iowa, says or tweets something widely viewed as racist, anti-Semitic, white nationalist, or he insults immigrants, blacks, Latinos, women seeking abortions -- or some combination thereof.
2. Outrage ensues, and King’s words are denounced by fellow Republicans, with such phrases as “completely inappropriate” and “we must stand up against white supremacy.”
3. King says or tweets that he is not racist, denounces the Holocaust, or says that his remarks were obviously taken out of context.
4. Repeat.
On Saturday, after King’s lament in the New York Times that “white nationalist” had become a pejorative term, the Congressional Black Caucus said Republicans need to use more than words to denounce King.
“If Republicans really believe these racist statements have no place in our government, then their party must offer more than shallow temporary statements of condemnation,” CBC said in a tweet on Saturday. “Instead they must actually condemn Mr. King by removing him from his committee assignments so that he can no longer affect policies that impact the very people he has made it clear that he disdains.”
Anything thing less from the Republican Party, the caucus said, is essentially “tacit acceptance of racism.”
King ultimately released a statement and addressed the issue in a speech on the House floor, saying he rejects “those labels and the evil ideology that they define.” He proclaimed himself “simply a Nationalist.”
But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he’s meeting with King on Monday.
“Action will be taken,” McCarthy said on CBS News. “I’m having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in the Republican Party.”
But that was far from the first time that King has been denounced for offensive statements.
An incomplete list of the others:
• The time he claimed “our civilization” can’t be restored with “somebody else’s babies.”
In 2017, King tweeted that he agreed with far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders that “our civilization” cannot be restored “with somebody else’s babies.”
As The Washington Post’s Philip Bump wrote after King made the statement, the idea that national identity and racial identity overlap is at the center of white nationalism.
“The formulation of ‘our’ civilization being at risk from ‘somebody else’s babies” is a deliberate suggestion that American civilization is threatened by unnamed ‘others.’” Bump wrote.
• The time King retweeted a message by a Nazi sympathizer and defended it for weeks
In June, King retweeted a message sent by Mark Collett, a self-described “Nazi sympathizer.” King declined to delete the retweet and spent weeks defending it.
Collett is a British author who, as The Post’s Avi Selk wrote, “questions the Holocaust, wants to separate the continents by races, blames slavery on Jews, mocks interracial children, wrote a book embracing National Socialism, and once called himself a ‘Nazi sympathizer.’”
On neo-fascist message boards, users celebrated a U.S. congressman’s endorsement of an overt National Socialist, Selk wrote.
• The time he met with a far-right group with Nazi ties on a trip sponsored by a Holocaust memorial group
In October, during a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group, King spoke to the Unzensuriert site. As The Post’s Mike DeBonis wrote, Unzensuriert is associated with Austria’s Freedom Party, DeBonis wrote, and was founded by a former Nazi SS officer and is now led by Heinz-Christian Strache, who was active in neo-Nazi circles as a youth. The party has embraced a hard-line anti-immigration stance, one that was echoed by King when he was there.
“What does this diversity bring that we don’t already have?” King said in the interview with the site. “Mexican food, Chinese food, those things - well, that’s fine. But what does it bring that we don’t have that is worth the price? We have a lot of diversity within the U.S. already.”
• The time he said blacks and Latinos will be “fighting each other” before the United States becomes a majority-minority nation
Shortly after King was criticized for his comments about rebuilding Western civilization, King responded to a conversation between Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about whites becoming a minority in the United States by 2044.
“Ramos’ stock in trade is identifying and trying to drive wedges between race,” King told Iowa radio host Jan Mickelson on 1040 WHO.
“When you start accentuating the differences, then you start ending up with people that are at each other’s throats. And he’s adding up Hispanics and blacks into what he predicts will be in greater number than whites in America. I will predict that Hispanics and the blacks will be fighting each other before that happens.”
• The time he said black people could afford abortions if they stopped buying iPhones
In a September 2016 congressional hearing, King said that even if he succeeded in taking away Medicaid funding for abortion, blacks would find a way to end their pregnancies anyway.
According to Rewire, after saying that abortion was a “tragedy for any life, no matter what color,” King also responded, “They chose to have an abortion. I would give you even money that a vast majority of mothers who say they can’t afford an abortion have an iPhone, which costs more.”

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."

Meet Bret Richards, Steve King's second Republican challenger

Texto completo: Earlier this fall, I heard a longtime Iowa Republican consultant predict, in public, that Congressman Steve King would not be on the ballot in 2020 – either by losing a primary or choosing to retire. And he said he didn't care which one it turned out to be.
I was skeptical. Despite his close call in the 2018 election, King's practically an institution in Republican-dominated western Iowa. He handily dispatched his last two primary challengers.
But now it seems as if GOP consultant David Kochel's prediction has some potential. State Sen. Randy Feenstra announced on Wednesday morning that he was planning to challenge King in the June 2020 primary. By afternoon, I had heard from a second Republican who is going to run: Bret Richards of Irwin. I'll tell you more about him in a minute.
I'm hearing there may be at least one more GOP challenger who hasn't yet announced as well. And King may be feeling some pressure: He kicked off the new year with an announcement that he would hold 39 town hall meetings in his district this year. That's a huge change from his past practice of avoiding public forums in favor of telephone town halls and by-invitation meetings.
What King likely won't be able to change, especially now that Democrats are in charge in the House, is his relatively paltry record of legislative accomplishments. That's one of the reasons Richards, a 47-year-old Army veteran, educator and former businessman, has decided to mount a challenge to King.
At first glance, Richards seems like someone who might be content to keep voting for King as long as the Kiron Republican wants to serve. He grew up in Irwin, a Shelby County town of just over 300 people, married his high-school sweetheart, got a degree in civil engineering from the University of Iowa and came back home after the Army to work in his family petroleum and convenience-store business. The business was sold in 2015. He spends his free time attending his three kids' sporting events and other school activities.
But Richards also views King's service from the perspective of his second career. He has a doctorate in human capital management and teaches classes in interdisciplinary leadership at Creighton University. He isn't seeing much leadership from King.
"Living here my whole life, it's frustrating to see how ineffective he has been," Richards said in a phone interview. "... For the 4th District, we do not have great representation in Congress. And we need it."
Richards mainly keeps his focus on issues like rural development, health care and veterans' mental health. He doesn't mention the controversy over King's inflammatory, race-based rhetoric until he's asked. "He can answer for his own actions," Richards said. "I know who I am. I know I won't embarrass the state."
King in recent years has gained national notoriety for virulent, anti-immigrant rhetoric such as characterizing undocumented border-crossers as drug mules with "calves the size of cantaloupes." He's also made it his business to travel the globe to hobnob with far-right European politicians, and he endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi affiliations. Several of his corporate supporters dropped him just before the 2018 election amid a wave of sensitivity about anti-Semitism in the wake of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.
On Thursday, King's interview with the New York Times was generating a buzz, especially his quote lamenting the controversy generated by phrases like "white supremacist."
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said, according to the Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
It appears King doesn't think this kind of talk hurts his prospects. Now Republicans have an opportunity to prove him wrong for the sake of Iowa's reputation, if nothing else.
Richards describes himself as a conservative Republican who has been interested in public service his entire adult life. Other than a stint as Irwin mayor in the early 2000s (almost an obligation in a town that size), his experience in politics has consisted mostly of efforts to influence public policy through the Petroleum Marketers of Iowa. He's also on the board of the community hospital in Manning, which gives him a platform to talk about health-care issues in rural Iowa.
He would have to be considered a dark horse candidate at this point. Feenstra, who chairs the Iowa Senate's tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, gained prominence last year as an architect of the $2 billion tax cut. Tax cuts are on the agenda again this year, which will keep him in the spotlight — but also in Des Moines, instead of campaigning full time in the district.
Based on nothing more than a phone interview, I'd say Richards is neither a polished speaker nor an expert on a wide range of issues. But if he works hard enough to meet voters personally, he likely can speak their language and relate to their concerns.
"I think what matters is showing that I'm a leader that can get things done," Richards said. "I think I can connect with voters."
Richards doesn't discount the power of incumbency. King is serving his ninth term in the House.
"I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could win," Richards said. "But Congressman King is not going to win his next congressional election."
That's a message many Iowa Democrats have been pining to hear — and, apparently, a growing number of Republicans as well.

Presidential bid appears likely for NY's Gillibrand

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appears all but certain to launch a 2020 presidential campaign soon.
Gillibrand, a Democrat, has keyed in on the Rensselaer County city of Troy as a potential headquarters for a 2020 campaign, not far from her home in Brunswick, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Next weekend, Politico reports Gillibrand is planning on traveling to Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are a key first step in the primary season.
And she has been staffing up for a potential bid, selecting a campaign manager, communications directors and other key positions for the coming campaign, according to various reports.
A spokesman for Gillibrand did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Gillibrand has been publicly mulling a presidential run since cruising to re-election in November.
She is expected to formally announce her run in the coming days or weeks.
Long rumored to have aspirations for higher office, she first publicly confirmed she was considering a 2020 bid on Nov. 8, two days after she winning re-election in New York.
"I believe right now that every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans, so I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought of consideration," Gillibrand said then on CBS' "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
Gillibrand, 52, has been New York's junior senator since 2009, when she was selected by then-Gov. David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had become secretary of state.
She's been easily re-elected three times since then — in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Prior to that, she was a congresswoman representing an Albany-area district from 2007 until she was appointed senator.
Gillibrand's apparent run comes despite repeatedly pledging to serve a full six-year term in the Senate, which would run through 2024.
Her most public pledge came during an October 2018 debate.
"I will serve my six-year term," she said then.
That led to a quick rebuttal from Republican opponent Chele Farley: "Honestly, I don't believe that."
The New York Times reported Friday that Gillibrand had hired Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as her 2020 communications director.
Her campaign staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her chief of staff in the Senate, and Dan McNally, who worked for Senate Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Both reports cited unnamed people who were familiar with the hirings.

Texto completo: The more the merrier in the presidential race should be the general rule for a party not in power and eager to reclaim the White House after multiple years in the wilderness. However, I draw the line at self-absorbed billionaires with no governing experience who throw their money around on vanity projects.
I'm not talking about President Donald Trump, for now, but progressive moneyman Tom Steyer.
The New York Times reports: "Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has crusaded for President Trump's impeachment, said on Wednesday that he would not join the pack of Democrats running for president in 2020." Instead, he will continue running those impeachment ads. "Underwritten by Mr. Steyer's personal wealth," the Times report continued, "the impeachment campaign has bombarded television and computer screens around the country with ads demanding Mr. Trump's ouster, and staged pro-impeachment events around the country." He's spent tens of millions of dollars already and plans to spend $40 million more.
I don't share Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's aversion to self-funded candidates. A candidate such as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would add a lot to the 2020 race, has well-thought-out positions on important issues and would be qualified to serve as president.
However, I certainly do object to unqualified dilettantes taking up space and political oxygen. (In fact, put me down as against any presidential candidate who has zero military or civilian service.) Steyer's decision not to run therefore is good for the country and the Democratic Party. It is also far from certain that he would have won many votes.
"Steyer made his vast fortune as the founder of a hedge fund, and his portfolio of investments included considerable stakes in fossil fuel companies," The New York Times report noted. "As a wealthy white man, he could have been an awkward cultural match for a party increasingly defined by demands for racial and gender equality, and economic populism."
However, it is ridiculous, deplorable even, for him to spend tens of millions of dollars on an utterly useless campaign to impeach Trump, regardless of whether you favor impeachment. Trump either will or won't be impeached after the report from special counsel Robert Mueller is completed; lawmakers and the public won't be influenced by Steyer's annoying, ubiquitous ads -- featuring himself! -- but by what's in the report, Trump's political standing and the reaction of voters.
Steyer's financial wastefulness is his own concern, I guess, but the moral vacuity of spending money on such an ostentatious activity is matched only by Arab sheikhs eating gold. (Really, that's a thing now.) Imagine the children who could be educated, the families fed, the shelter and mental health services provided to the homeless, the diseases eradicated, the species saved and the mentors hired for $40 million.
Even if you wanted to spend your money on politics, why not do something halfway productive? Register new voters, promote civics education, run a campaign to end gerrymandering or finance media literacy. The possibilities are endless. (It should be noted that Steyer did spend on activities such as voter turnout, but he chooses to blow tens of millions more on his vanity project.)
Oh, and I have one question for the environmentalist mogul: Why did he add to his carbon footprint by flying to Iowa to announce he wasn't running for president?

Texto completo: Trump slams report that FBI probed if he worked for Russia
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily rejected a New York Times report that said the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 to determine whether he worked, knowingly or unknowingly, on behalf of Russia.
The report said that in the days after Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, the agency began investigating whether the president had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
U.S. counterintelligence investigators attempted to assess whether Trump's actions constituted a possible threat to national security, and agents also tried to determine whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unknowingly come under Moscow's influence, the Times reported.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James B. Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
The president also criticized familiar targets including special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump concluded Saturday by asserting that he'd been tougher on Russia than former U.S. presidents.

S. Korea balks at Trump's push over more funds for U.S. troops
WASHINGTON - South Korea is resisting a Trump administration demand for sharply higher payments to defray the cost of basing U.S. forces on its territory, raising fears that President Donald Trump might threaten a troop drawdown at a time of sensitive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
U.S. negotiators have sought a 50 percent increase in Seoul's annual payment, which last year was about $830 million, or about half of the estimated cost of hosting 28,500 U.S. troops, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions.
South Korea is expected to make a counteroffer this month.
The standoff is straining the alliance as Trump plans a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to renew the U.S. push for elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.

Former Obama housing chief Castro enters 2020 campaign
SAN ANTONIO - Assailing President Donald Trump for "a crisis of leadership," former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as a rush of Democrats accelerates.
Castro, 44, could end up being the only Latino in a crowded Democratic field. He was San Antonio's mayor for five year and U.S. housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter the race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have formed exploratory committees. Casto's first trip as a candidate comes Monday to Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for a border wall.

U.S. calls for the formation of new government in Venezuela
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - The U.S. stepped up its criticism of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday with an explicit call for the formation of a new government in the South American country.
The State Department said in a statement that it stood behind the head of Venezuela's opposition-run congress, Juan Guaido, who said Friday that he was prepared to step into the presidency temporarily. The statement was the latest in a series of Trump administration attacks on Maduro, whose inauguration to a new term as president Thursday has been widely denounced as illegitimate.
"The people of Venezuela deserve to live in freedom in a democratic society governed by the rule of law," State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.

Pompeo upbeat on deal with Turkey over Kurds
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - Despite Turkey's vows to the contrary, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday he was confident the two nations can agree on a way to protect U.S.-allied Kurdish rebels in Syria after American troops withdraw from the country.
After speaking to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Pompeo said an agreement was a work in progress but can be achieved in a way that allows the Turks to defend their country while leaving alone Kurds who do not pose a threat.
The top U.S. diplomat said he was "optimistic" that Kurds who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State group in Syria are not threatened by pledges from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch military operations against what he terms Kurdish "terrorists."

Hamas probe: Israel tried to wiretap group in Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - Gaza's ruling Hamas said Saturday that Israeli undercover forces had attempted to install equipment to monitor the Islamic militant group's landline communications network during a botched mission in November.
The findings of an investigation were announced by the Hamas military wing, Qassam Brigades, in a prerecorded TV statement.
Hamas presented surveillance footage and photos to back up its claims.
Hamas thwarted an attempt to "plant spying devices in the Gaza Strip," a Qassam spokesman said in the statement.
Israel's military has not released details about the operation, which went awry Nov. 11, leading to the heaviest round of cross-border fire, including Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes, since a 2014 war between the two sides.

Still missing: Police arrested 12 people alleged to have been involved in the kidnapping of an American in Costa Rica. Police say a joint operation caught nine Costa Rican suspects Friday; three others were arrested in Spain. William Sean Creighton Kopko was abducted Sept. 24, 2018, in Costa Rica. He is still missing.

In Congo: Presidential runner-up Martin Fayulu has asked a constitutional court to order a recount. He has accused the winner, Felix Tshisekedi, of a deal with President Joseph Kabila. An official said Fayulu has two options: accept the vote or it is annulled, which would keep Kabila in power until another election.

Resumen: According to the New York Times report, first published Friday, Comey's ouster reportedly caused such concern among law enforcement that officials launched an investigation into not only whether Trump obstructed justice, but also whether or not he was under Kremlin influence and advancing an anti-American agenda. Law enforcement officials contended that if Trump axed Comey to bring an end to to the Russia probe, it would be a matter of national security and a clear effort to prevent the United States intelligence community from learning the full extent of the Kremlin's sway over the 2016 election, sources told the Times. The White House initially said Trump fired him at the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but shortly after, the President explicitly admitted in a TV interview that he moved to dismiss Comey because of "this Russia thing."

Texto completo: President Trump fired off a flurry of enraged tweets Saturday morning following a report that claims the FBI opened a secret investigation into the commander-in-chief's alleged ties with Russia shortly after he fired FBI Director James Comey.
"Wow, just learned in the failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the President tweeted.
According to the New York Times report, first published Friday, Comey's ouster reportedly caused such concern among law enforcement that officials launched an investigation into not only whether Trump obstructed justice, but also whether or not he was under Kremlin influence and advancing an anti-American agenda.
Law enforcement officials contended that if Trump axed Comey to bring an end to to the Russia probe, it would be a matter of national security and a clear effort to prevent the United States intelligence community from learning the full extent of the Kremlin's sway over the 2016 election, sources told the Times.
The investigation, launched by officials just after the President booted Comey as FBI in director in May 2017, was picked up by Robert Mueller upon his appointment as special counsel the same month.
Trump also took aim at Mueller amid his Saturday morning rant against the former FBI director.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted.
"He was a crooked cop who is totally being protected by his friend, Bob Mueller, & 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!"
Comey fired back with a tweet of his own late Saturday morning.
"'I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.' - FDR," he wrote.
The President has repeatedly defended his firing of Comey, though his reason for doing so has changed on several occasions. The White House initially said Trump fired him at the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but shortly after, the President explicitly admitted in a TV interview that he moved to dismiss Comey because of "this Russia thing."
In his fifth tweet of the morning, Trump praised his administration's relationship with Russia, holding it above those of President's past.
"I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any President," he wrote. "At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!"
No evidence has yet been revealed that Trump was secretly operating on behalf of Russia, though several of his associates - including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort - have been indicted and pleaded to guilty to Russia-linked crimes.

Texto completo: Dear Senate Republicans,
I really enjoy spending time with you. You are interesting and excellent company (I really mean that!). When I'm with you, we often enter a magical land in which Donald Trump doesn't exist. You're eager to tell me about the issues you're working on, and sometimes we have these substantive conversations in which we get to ignore the raging dumpster fire on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
But there's one question, which I'd like to ask of practically every member of Congress. Why are you so dispossessed?
You take all the trouble to run for public office and, against all odds, you actually get in a position to wield influence. But then you accede to a thousand small decisions that you and your predecessors have made, and you give it all away.
There are 535 Americans elected to Congress, but the way things are arranged now only three have real power - Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. Only a handful of others - in leadership - have a whiff of power. The rest of you have rendered yourselves less powerful, in a way never envisioned by the founders.
You Senate Republicans are in a double bind because what power you didn't give to the majority leader you gave to Trump.
I understand why you were deferential in 2017 and 2018. But the Democratic capture of the House changes everything and gives you an opportunity to lead.
First, there is a good chance that the Democrats will impeach Trump this year or next. When that happens, you Senate Republicans are effectively the jury. Suddenly Trump needs you more than you need him. Suddenly he's going to be much less likely to go against you personally. Even the mere specter of impeachment changes his whole attitude toward you.
Second, the power structure of Washington has fundamentally changed. Pelosi is now one power center. Trump is another. You Senate Republicans are the fulcrum between the two. You are the crucial players in this drama if you decide to make yourselves that.
Take the government shutdown fiasco, for example. On one side there is Trump, who wants a concrete or steel wall - which is an inane policy, but there it is. On the other side is Pelosi, who says walls are immoral. No money for a wall. Pelosi's policy is equally inane. We've already got 654 miles of fencing on the southern border. It may be wasteful, but how is it "immoral" to go up to 800 or even 1,000 miles?
This is where you come in. You are at the fulcrum between the absolutist inane positions. You have the power to create facts on the ground.
You pass the obvious deal that everyone has been talking about for a year: a wall for DACA. Trump won the 2016 election offering voters a wall - so he gets $5 billion for "border security," which he can claim is a wall. The Democrats won the 2018 midterms offering voters a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, so they get their path.
By passing an actual bill you cut through the dysfunctional negotiations at the White House. You make Trump and Pelosi come to you, to accept or reject.
Moreover, this general approach can be applied across policy areas. It does not mean going against Trump or your base. You are giving Trump things he's unable to get on his own. It doesn't mean crushing the Democrats. It means exercising leadership to create a government that actually works.
The White House can't lead because it lacks a legislative agenda and a competent chief executive. Pelosi can't lead because she has control of only one chamber and she has a base that doesn't believe that Trump is legitimate or that compromise with him is moral. McConnell can't lead because he's in a tough position in Kentucky.
It's only you - the 52 other Senate Republicans - who can fill that leadership vacuum.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Pegan diet could be next big trend

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."
Organic produce is recommended as part of a pegan diet.

Dietitians recommend sheep or goat dairy products on the diet because they're easier to digest than milk from cows.

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

American Airlines stock drops, pulling down other airlines, on weaker earnings
American Airlines Group stock tumbled more than 4 percent and pulled other carriers in its wake after saying 2018 earnings could fall short of its forecast because domestic fares were weaker than expected. Adjusted earnings will be $4.40 to $4.60 a share, the carrier said Thursday in a regulatory filing. American had forecast profit of as much as $5, and analysts had anticipated $4.62. The update compounded a bleak outlook for US carriers as economic uncertainty threatens global demand. Delta Air Lines Inc. recently trimmed its forecast for a key gauge of pricing power and set the stage for a gloomy earnings season, which kicks off next week for the major carriers. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
EMPLOYMENT
Audit finds program designed for young workers hired a 62-year-old
A New York state audit has found lapses at a program that rewards employers who hire young workers — including a 62-year-old who was deemed eligible for the program. The review, published Thursday by Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, found several problems in the state-run program, including nearly $200,000 in questionable tax credits. Some of the companies that received the credits hired employees who were too old for the program, while others didn't adequately verify their employee's eligibility. The jobs program, started in 2011, encourages employers to hire at-risk youth ages 16 to 24 by awarding tax credits of up to $500 for a full-time worker. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

US supplier of T-shirts, team apparel cuts ties to Chinese company over forced labor
A United States supplier of T-shirts and other team apparel to college bookstores cut its ties Wednesday with a Chinese company that drew workers from an internment camp holding targeted members of ethnic minority groups. In recent years, authorities in the far west Chinese region of Xinjiang have detained an estimated 1 million Uighurs and Kazakhs in heavily-secured facilities where detainees say they are ordered to renounce their language and religion while pledging loyalty to the China's ruling Communist Party. Last month an Associated Press investigation found the Chinese government had also started forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. The investigation tracked recent shipments from one such factory, the privately owned Hetian Taida Apparel, located inside an internment camp, to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, N.C. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates fall to lowest level in nine months
Long-term mortgage rates continued to fall this week, reaching their lowest levels in nine months. The decline in home borrowing rates in recent weeks has been a spur to prospective home buyers, reflected in a spike in applications for mortgages. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dipped to 4.45 percent this week from 4.51 percent last week. Rates remain far above last year's levels, however. The key 30-year rate averaged 3.99 percent a year ago. The average rate for 15-year fixed-rate loans fell to 3.89 percent from 3.99 percent last week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
GOVERNMENT
Shaheen, Hassan file legislation to block drug companies from ad expense deductions
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, has introduced a bill that would prohibit pharmaceutical companies from claiming tax deductions for consumer advertising expenses. Under current law, drug manufacturers are allowed to deduct the cost of advertising expenses from federal taxes. A news release from Shaheen's office Thursday said those advertising expenses have more than quadrupled over the past two decades, rising from $1.3 billion in 1997 to $6 billion in 2016. Shaheen said the aggressive advertising also increases demand and allows drug companies to increase prices. She said taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing the ads. The bill is cosponsored by fellow Democratic Senator Maggie ­Hassan. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google wins a round in European 'right to be forgotten' case
Google shouldn't have to apply the so-called right to be forgotten globally, an adviser to the EU's top court said in a boost for the US giant's fight with a French privacy regulator over where to draw the line between privacy and freedom of speech. While backing Google's stance, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar of the EU Court of Justice said that search engine operators must take every measure available to remove access to links to outdated or irrelevant information about a person on request. The Luxembourg-based court follows such advice in a majority of its final rulings, which normally come a few months after the opinions. Google has been fighting efforts led by France's privacy watchdog to globalize the right to be forgotten, which was created by the EU court in a landmark ruling in 2014, without defining how, when, and where search engine operators should remove links. This has triggered a wave of legal challenges. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Google shareholder sues over large payouts to sexual harassers
A Google shareholder sued the company's board of directors and senior management on Thursday, arguing that the tech giant's leaders breached their duty to investors when they covered up sexual misconduct by executives and gave harassers large payouts. The suit, by shareholder James Martin, stems from revelations last year that the company awarded a $90 million exit package to executive Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android operating system, even as Rubin was being pushed out over sexual misconduct. Google had asked for Rubin's resignation in 2014 after determining that allegations that he had coerced a woman into performing oral sex in a hotel room the previous year were credible. Rubin was celebrated when he left Google, and the real reason for his departure was made public by the Information and New York Times, which also reported the payout. Rubin has denied the allegations. — WASHINGTON POST

Group funded by Coca-Cola undermines Chinese fight against obesity, research finds
China's efforts to keep obesity in check have been undermined from the inside by the food industry, according to newly published research. A scholar of Chinese society at Harvard University traced how a group funded by Coca-Cola and other food companies enjoyed close ties to Chinese health officials. The group helped tilt the country's obesity fight with the message that exercise matters more than dietary habits, which health advocates say is a way to deflect attention from food's role in fueling obesity. The International Life Sciences Institute was created in 1978 by a former Coke executive and has 17 branches around the world. In China, its small but influential branch organized obesity conferences focusing on physical activity, with speakers including Coke-funded researchers and a Coke executive, according to the papers published in The BMJ and The Journal of Public Health Policy. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Government shutdown threatens newborns, their families

Texto completo: Like many expecting moms, I spend a lot of time reading anything I can to prepare for my babies to come.
I’ve found a great community of moms online from around the world who are due around the same time I am. On internet message boards we share recommendations for baby gear, philosophies on parenting and a whole lot of “is it normal when my body does x, y or z?”
The discussions are generally supportive and never political – just moms-to-be sharing their swirling questions, fears and hopes before they bring new lives into the world.
It was in that same spirit that some U.S. federal workers and spouses of federal workers began posting about the government shutdown on one of those boards.
With babies due in a month or two, many expressed deep fears about how they would be able to put food on the table or pay rent or their mortgages without receiving a pay check.
Additionally, when the government is shut down, some said they (or their spouses) are not eligible to receive pay for time off they have already planned to care for their babies. In fact, many are working now for free because their jobs are vital for the safety and security of our Country.
“There’s no leave during a shutdown,” one mom, a government scientist, posted. “So if this drags on or our little guy comes early, I go out and there’s no guarantee I’ll get paid for any of it. And hubby doesn’t know what to do because he is also a fed, so does he stay home and help and risk no one is getting paid?”
New parents already face so many fears when they’re preparing to welcome children – adding the real possibility that they won’t be able to feed or house their kids is cruel and immoral. And it’s also medically risky, as high maternal stress during pregnancy has been linked to preterm labor and low birth weight.
All of this comes in such stark contrast to what’s happening in California.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has three small children of his own, has already begun discussing a proposal to provide families with six months of paid leave after the birth of a child, along with a host of other improvements to prenatal and child care.
“Economists have found that about six months of parental leave is ideal” according to a report in the Jan. 6 New York Times about Newsom’s plans. “A shorter period offers fewer benefits for babies’ health and development, and a longer one can hurt women’s careers and earnings.”
In fact, the report goes on to describe how inadequate parental leave policies have caused fewer women to rejoin the workforce, which hurts the nation’s economic output.
This is another way the government shutdown is damaging the U.S. economy, both in the short term and potentially for generations to come. It compels federal workers to grapple with deciding whether to continue their career paths in the federal government, seek work elsewhere, or stay home.
And this is added to all the other impacts to our nation’s safety and security, to the economic security of some 800,000 workers who are going without pay, to moral fabric of our nation.
President Trump has already demonstrated he doesn’t care about immigrant children seeking refuge at our nation’s borders. But what about the unborn children of federal workers whose lives and futures he is risking today? Will he take action for them – for their families – and stop this political stunt over a wall he promised Mexico would pay for anyway and reopen our government?

Texto completo: Iowa safety inspectors say their firings were retaliation
IOWA CITY - Two Iowa workplace safety inspectors were fired in what they are calling retaliation for blowing the whistle on a hostile environment inside their agency.
The firings of Jason Garmoe and Travis Stein on Tuesday are the latest turmoil at the Division of Labor, which has been rocked by recent personnel turnover and accusations of cronyism and harassment. The agency accused both men of misconduct that included leaving a state vehicle running for two hours while conducting an inspection - an allegation they call false.
Republicans slam Rep. King for what they call racist remarks
WASHINGTON - House Republicans on Thursday criticized a fellow GOP lawmaker from Iowa for making what they said were "racist" comments.
Rep. Steve King of Iowa was quoted in The New York Times saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
The comment drew a denunciation from a member of House Republican leadership. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, said King's remarks were "abhorrent and racist." Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash , of Michigan, tweeted, "This is an embrace of racism"
King later issued a statement saying he is neither a white nationalist nor a white supremacist.
Randy Feenstra, a Republican state senator, announced Wednesday that he plans to run against King in 2020. King has represented the district since 2013.
Illinois accepts $10 million bid to repair state fair coliseum
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. - Illinois officials have accepted a bid of more than $10 million from a contractor to repair the deteriorating Illinois State Fair Coliseum, with the goal of reopening the coliseum in time for this year's fair.
Springfield-based R.D. Lawrence Construction Co. hopes to begin construction in the coming weeks. Funding for the project comes from $30 million the General Assembly allocated last year to repair the state's two fairgrounds.
Regulators cite contractors in Wisconsin gas explosion
MADISON, Wis. - Federal safety regulators have cited two contractors for failing to locate a gas main that exploded during work in a Madison suburb in July.
A VC Tech employee punctured the line while installing fiber optics, resulting in a blast that leveled a half a city block in Sun Prairie and killed firefighter Corey Barr.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited VC Tech and the contractor that hired the firm, Kansas-based Bear Communications, $12,934 each on Jan. 4.

Plan to Honor German Socialite Is Halted

Texto completo: El Museo del Barrio in Harlem, the country's oldest museum devoted to Latino art, announced on Thursday that it was rescinding a decision to honor a princess from Germany at its upcoming 50th anniversary gala.
Longtime admirers of the museum had criticized the choice to honor Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a 58-year-old socialite who lives in a 500-room palace in Regensburg, Germany, and is known for her connections to archconservatives who complained that Pope Francis is too liberal. They include Roman Catholic officials and Stephen K. Bannon, the chief executive of Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign, who has forged relationships with far-right political parties in Germany and France.
Some questioned what Princess Gloria had in common with an institution that was started inside a public school classroom by a group of Puerto Rican artists and activists.
Ana Dopico, an associate professor at New York University who studies United States Latino cultures, wrote on Twitter that it was "staggering and shocking" that El Museo would honor "a princess of Europe's extreme right wing."
A former El Museo board member, Alex Gonzalez, said he had asked the museum how Princess Gloria, who was reported to have once blamed the nature of Africans for spreading AIDS on that continent, "aligns with the mission and purpose of a Latinx institution" -- but had not received an answer.
"Her views on the African AIDS crisis were so lacking in humanity and expressed so publicly on live TV that it should have raised a red flag," he said on Wednesday in an email message.
After inquiries by The New York Times on Wednesday, the museum issued a statement on Thursday morning. "As a cultural institution founded on the principles of inclusion, civil rights and diversity, El Museo del Barrio is committed to honoring individuals that uphold those values and support the elevation of Latino and Latin American art and culture both in the United States and beyond," the museum said. "As a result, El Museo del Barrio has decided to part ways with H.S.H. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis."
Princess Gloria, reached on Thursday by email, said: "I am disappointed to what degree the society is divided today and that there seems to be absolutely no room for tolerance whatsoever. My conservative religious views have absolutely no impact on my open mind on cultural diversity and inclusion. I have been friends with all sorts of people of different political and religious views all my life."
The criticism is the latest in a series of controversies to buffet El Museo, a respected institution that has put on well-received shows but which has also experienced serious setbacks. Financial shortfalls have forced staff cuts and reduced operating hours. Several high-profile executive departures have created a sometimes acrimonious climate.
The museum's fourth leader in seven years, Patrick Charpenel, was named as executive director in 2017. He said that he wanted to explore subjects like immigration, exclusion and diversity, adding that museums sometimes "have to become platforms for political resistance."
But the decision to honor Princess Gloria was a step in the opposite direction by the museum's leadership, said Arlene Dávila, a professor and author of a forthcoming book on Latinx art (Latinx is a gender neutral alternative to Latino or Latina). "How little they know about our community," she said. "It really is a slap in the face."
Other honorees at the gala, which is to be held in May at the Plaza Hotel, are Raphael Montañez Ortiz, an artist and founder of El Museo; Ella Fontanals-Cisneros, an art collector and philanthropist who created the nonprofit Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation; and Craig Robins, a collector and real estate developer who is a trustee of the Pérez Art Museum in Miami.
For many years, Princess Gloria was a hard partying art-collecting aristocrat who was sometimes known as "Princess TNT." Nowadays she is a practicing Catholic whose intimates include several figures who vigorously oppose the current Pope.
She has said that Cardinal Raymond Burke, the American leader of the anti-Francis faction, is as close to her as a family priest. She introduced Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German Cardinal who was fired by Francis from his position as the church's top doctrinal watchdog, to Mr. Bannon.
Mr. Bannon, who met last year with leaders of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party and addressed France's far right National Front, aims to build a "gladiator school" for the training of Catholics hostile to Francis.
Princess Gloria was reported to have told a German television host in 2001 that Africa had a high incidence of AIDS because "blacks like to copulate a lot." She later sought to amend that, saying the reason for that was the continent's intense heat.
Some people who criticized El Museo said that the decision to honor Princess Gloria was part of a series of moves that have distanced the museum from its roots.
The museum was founded in 1969, during a time of political upheaval, to emphasize Puerto Rican cultural contributions. But it eventually embraced a broader mission to exhibit the work of Latino, Caribbean and Latin American artists from all backgrounds.
"El Museo was founded by New York Puerto Rican activists, educators and artists whose community had been excluded from elite institutions," Ms. Dopico wrote in an email message. "What values does the Museum honor in honoring Von Thurn und Taxis? How is this honor connected to el Museo's past or its future?"

Commentary: Former New York Times religion reporter slams grand jury report on clerical abuse

Texto completo: “Grossly misleading, irresponsible, inaccurate, and unjust” is how former New York Times religion reporter Peter Steinfels describes last August’s Pennsylvania grand jury report in its sweeping accusation that Catholic bishops refused to protect children from sexual abuse.
The report from a grand jury impaneled by the Pennsylvania attorney general to investigate child sexual abuse in the state’s Catholic dioceses has revived the furor over the abuse scandal, causing the resignation of the archbishop of Washington, D.C., and inspiring similar investigations in other states.
Steinfels argues that it is an oversimplification to assert, as does the report, that “all” victims “were brushed aside, in every part of the state, by church leaders who preferred to protect abusers and their institutions above all.”
Writing in the Catholic journal Commonweal, Steinfels acknowledges the horror of clerical abuse and the terrible damage done to children, but he complains that no distinctions have been made in the grand jury report from diocese to diocese, or from one bishop’s tenure to another. All are tarred with the same brush.
Steinfels’ article will be published in the magazine’s Jan. 25 issue and is currently available on its website.
A major fault with the report, according to Steinfels, is its failure to acknowledge the impact of the 2002 Dallas Charter, which changed dramatically how the church responded to abuse. The charter required reporting credible accusations to police, the establishment of lay review boards and the removal of any priest guilty of abuse.
He also notes that “a good portion of these crimes, perhaps a third or more, only came to the knowledge of church authorities in 2002 or after, when the Dallas Charter mandated automatic removal from ministry.” How can bishops be blamed for covering up crimes they did not know about?
“The report’s conclusions about abuse and cover-up are stated in timeless fashion,” he writes. It leaves the impression that there has been no change in how bishops deal with abuse and that they are still leaving children at risk.
Almost all the media stories on the report, notes Steinfels, were based on the 12-page introduction and the dozen or so sickening examples in the introduction. The report was 884 or 1,356 pages long, depending on whether the dioceses’ responses were included. These responses were buried in the back of the report and are not included in the version on the attorney general’s website.
To show how diocesan policies got stricter over time, Steinfels examines the Erie Diocese in detail.
While the grand jury report accurately reports that Erie Bishop Donald Trautman reassigned an accused priest multiple times, it omits that these reassignments were to a chaplaincy at a nursing home, a senior living facility and a jail for adults, where the priest would not be ministering to children. The priest was forbidden to function as a priest outside of these assignments and was eventually barred from wearing priestly garb, before being kicked out of the priesthood altogether.
Nor does the report acknowledge Trautman’s assertion that “none of these priests is known to have reoffended.”
Steinfels points to the grand jury’s failure to report that Trautman attempted to meet with every victim and provided pastoral counseling and funds for therapy. It doesn’t reflect that in 2002 the bishop had all diocesan files reviewed by the Erie County district attorney, who concluded “no offenders remained in a position where they would present a danger.”
Most damning to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who ordered the grand jury report, is an Aug. 2, 2018, joint stipulation between him and Trautman stating that virtually all of the sweeping charges in the report were “not directed at Bishop Trautman.”
Those charges included statements in the report that “all [victims] were brushed aside”; that “the main thing” was to avoid “scandal”; that “priests were raping little boys and girls and the men of God … did nothing”; that diocesan officials knowingly “enabled offenders and endangered the welfare of children”; and that they blocked law enforcement from investigating “crimes against children.”
Steinfels believes the bad treatment of Erie was no exception. He shows how the phrase “circle of secrecy,” inaccurately attributed to Donald Wuerl when he led the Pittsburgh Diocese in the 1990s, had nothing to do with a church conspiracy, as the grand jury implied.
“Despite incomplete or inaccurate reports from Pittsburgh that prompted Cardinal Donald Wuerl to resign from his later position as archbishop of Washington,” writes Steinfels, “the response from Pittsburgh offers a clear, pointed rebuttal to many assertions in the report, for any reader willing to go to Page 1,113.”
Steinfels does not argue that things are now perfect in the church, but that the sweeping allegations of the grand jury report were “designed to be a weapon in the debate” to support a legislative agenda.
“Its impassioned, graphic style; its characterization of church leadership as no better, perhaps even worse, than the abusers; its refusal to make distinctions between dioceses or between periods of time like pre- and post-Dallas Charter,” writes Steinfels, “all are aimed at mobilizing public opinion behind legislation suspending the statute of limitations for civil suits and discrediting church opposition.”
Acknowledging the progress made by the American bishops is important, as Steinfels writes, because their experience is very important for the rest of the church, which today often makes the same mistakes the Americans made in the past. There is a lot the bishops of the world can learn from the U.S. bishops, and to ignore the progress they have made is not helpful.

Trump slams 'totally bonkers' media for leaks of off-the-record comments

Texto completo: President Trump lashed out Wednesday after comments he made during an off-the-record session with some of the country's most influential journalists found their way into press reports.

"Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!" Trump tweeted.

Trump on Tuesday hosted a select group of network anchors, including CNN’s Chris Cuomo and Fox News’ Bret Baier, for an off-the-record meal hours before he was due to address the nation in his first televised speech from the Oval Office. Remarks from their discussion, however, were reported on Thursday morning, including how the president had doubts a prime-time appearance would help him make his case for more than $5 billion to fund his southern border wall amid a partial government shutdown.

“It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” Trump said Tuesday, according to the New York Times.

Trump also reportedly told the network personalities that his trip to Texas on Thursday was a mere photo opportunity, but that White House communication aides Bill Shine, Sarah Sanders, and Kellyanne Conway thought it would be "worth it" as negotiations with congressional Democrats stall over funding for a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.

Texto completo: Singer-songwriter Steve Forbert once turned down the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine.
It's true.
"My second record had just come out. I came out of Mississippi and everything was new to me and I was just trying to adjust to everything. I was young and just wanted to concentrate on writing good songs," Forbert, 64, told the Clarion Ledger recently via phone.
Those songs are the reason the magazine sent rock writer Robert Palmer out to interview the Mississippi native on the heels of his 1979 Billboard No. 11 single, "Romeo's Tune," an achingly gorgeous slice of catchy American folk-pop.
Forbert will be playing a show at Duling Hall in Jackson Saturday night.
"It was a strange time to experience fame. Do I regret turning down the cover? No. Would it have made a difference? Who knows. That kind of thing is so abstract," Forbert said.
It was a heady time for Forbert after heading to New York City from his hometown of Meridan to try and make it as a singer-songwriter.
Following a stint playing at folk clubs in the city, he got a gig at NYC's fabled rock club CBGB's opening up for the Talking Heads. First, he asked the club's sound man if he could play there before approaching the club's owner, Hilly Kristal. Although the club wound up becoming the launching pad for American punk and New York City new wave, Kristal loved country music and intended his club to host those kinds of bands.
Forbert's folksy, acoustic sound was a perfect fit.
After a record company bidding war spurred by a 1977 New York Times article on Forbert, he signed with CBS records. He was managed at the time by Linda Stein and Ramones and Iggy and the Stooges manager Danny Fields.
Before he knew it, Forbert was being compared to John Prine and Bob Dylan.
"I thought it was a nice thing to be put in that company. I related to those people because of the songwriting," Forbert said.
Forbert's music and songs definitely had a Dylan influence but also sounded like the early material of Dire Straits and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, bands that had both just started their careers around the same time.
With The Byrds' 1965 version of Dylan's "Mr. Tamborine Man" as a major touchstone on Forbert's music and life, the Mississippi songwriter was creating "Americana" music before the alternative country genre even had a name.
"Yeah, I remember when I first heard the word used to describe Uncle Tupelo, Wilco and Whiskeytown. That's what I was doing, too. But not just me. Gram Parsons was doing the same thing, too," Forbert said.
Today, Forbert has a new album out, "The Magic Tree," as well as a memoir he wrote about his career in music, "Big City Cat: My Life in Folk-Rock."
The newly released music, with songs that were written between 1985 and 2018, is a companion piece to the book.
Still, Forbert's most recognized song is "Romeo's Tune," which turns 40 years old this year.
The first time he heard the song on the radio was on a tour bus "when we were out running all over the place.
"It was a hit but we recorded that song live. We did it on our own terms," Forbert said.

Fraud Claim Against McKinsey Prompts Judge to Reopen Case

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. -- A judge in Virginia reopened a more than two-year-old case on Wednesday to consider accusations that the powerful consultancy McKinsey & Company had defrauded his court while advising a bankrupt coal company.
"These are some of the most serious allegations that I have ever seen," said the judge, Kevin R. Huennekens of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Richmond.
The decision to reopen the bankruptcy case of Alpha Natural Resources was the latest in a series of court actions and legislative maneuvers meant to examine whether McKinsey has failed to disclose investments in the entities it helps reorganize -- an arrangement that could allow the company to profit off the plan it helped put in place. The request to reopen came from a retired turnaround specialist, Jay Alix, and was supported by the Justice Department's Office of the United States Trustee.
The federal bankruptcy code bars the professionals who work on bankruptcies from hiding their stakes, although possessing an interest in a company is not automatically disqualifying. The regulations require the disclosure of such connections between companies to ensure fair treatment of all parties.
McKinsey has denied wrongdoing. "We continue to stand by our disclosures, which have always fully complied with the law, and we are confident that Alix's fraud claims will be exposed as completely meritless," the company said in a statement.
McKinsey already faces similar claims of misconduct from Mr. Alix in the bankruptcy of another energy company, Westmoreland Coal, in Texas. And an examination by The New York Times revealed how the company is acting as an adviser in the bankruptcy-like restructuring of Puerto Rico while also holding some of the territory's debt. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed legislation that would strengthen the disclosure requirements in Puerto Rico's case.
Judge Huennekens did not indicate whether he thought there was any merit to the allegations involving Alpha Natural Resources, but said they were too grave to brush off.
"We have to get to the bottom of this," he said.
Mr. Alix, who formed a small investment company that bought some of Alpha's unsecured debt, has expressed concerns about McKinsey's behavior in bankruptcies for several years.
Mr. Alix alleged that there was "substantial, irrefutable evidence" that a McKinsey investment fund held an indirect stake in Alpha's secured debt. He told the court he believed McKinsey had improperly reaped a profit of $50 million because it helped determine the way secured creditors were compensated.
McKinsey made the investment through an outside hedge fund, Whitebox Advisors, which has been a creditor in several other bankruptcies where McKinsey played a role, as well as in Puerto Rico's case.
Judge Huennekens said he was especially troubled by Mr. Alix's accusation that McKinsey did not tell him about its relationship with Whitebox, because McKinsey disclosed its business connections to the judge privately, rather than in open court.
A lawyer for McKinsey, Jennifer Selendy, told the judge the omission was not intentional. She said the consulting firm believed it had provided all the information that Judge Huennekens had asked for. She said Mr. Alix was seizing upon innocent omissions and using them to make "wild accusations."
Judge Huennekens said McKinsey's relationship with Whitebox still should have been disclosed, saying that it would have shone out at him "like a beacon."
The Office of the United States Trustee had also asked for the Alpha case to be reopened. The office filed a statement in court in November, saying that McKinsey had failed to comply to make "transparent, timely and accurate" disclosures of potential conflicts. The statement asked Judge Huennekens to order McKinsey to pay back roughly $20 million in fees it had received.
The hearing Wednesday came a week after another bankruptcy judge, David R. Jones, told McKinsey and Mr. Alix that they should try to settle their dispute over Westmoreland Coal. If they didn't, he said, he would also be compelled to investigate further. The United States Trustee is also urging the court to disqualify McKinsey in that case and make it forfeit the fees it has earned.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

DNA Collected After Assault At Care Home

Texto completo: The police collected the DNA of male employees of a private nursing home in Arizona this week as they broadened the investigation into allegations that a woman in a vegetative state there who gave birth to a child last month had been sexually assaulted.
On Wednesday, the Phoenix Police Department appealed to the community for information related to the case and said the investigation could evolve as detectives learn more about the circumstances of the woman's pregnancy and the conception of the child.
"Right now we are investigating a sexual assault," Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman, said at a news conference. "Wherever this investigation takes us, we are prepared to go forward with it."
The moves represented an escalation in the case, which on Monday prompted the resignation of the longtime chief executive of Hacienda HealthCare, the parent company of the nursing home. The police announced Friday that they had opened the investigation into the alleged assault.
David Leibowitz, a spokesman for Hacienda Healthcare, said Tuesday that it welcomed the action by the police and had considered conducting voluntary genetic testing of its staff before company lawyers said that doing so would be illegal.
"Hacienda stands committed to doing everything in our power to bring this police investigation to a quick conclusion," the company statement said. "We will continue to cooperate with Phoenix Police and all other investigative agencies to uncover the facts in this deeply disturbing" situation.
Sergeant Thompson said Wednesday that the investigation began after the authorities responded to a 911 call on Dec. 29 that reported a baby in distress at the nursing home. When they arrived, they found a baby that had been born to a woman who was "unable to move and unable to communicate."
"She was not in a position to give consent to any of this," Sergeant Thompson said. "This was a helpless victim who was sexually assaulted."
He said that the baby had been delivered by the staff of the nursing home and that it was unclear if any staff members had known that the woman was pregnant.
He said both mother and baby were recovering at a nearby hospital. The woman has not been publicly identified by the police.
Court records obtained by The New York Times indicated that the victim was born in 1989 and had been at the facility since 1992, suggesting that she may have been in her current condition since the age of 3. They said she required total supervision.
Medical exam results filed with the court last spring said her condition had not changed and described both her rehabilitation prognosis and chance of discharge as "poor."
It was not clear how many male employees or others the police would obtain DNA from to be tested. Sergeant Thompson said that investigators had not identified a suspect in the case but that there was "a large number of individuals that we will gather evidence from."
He said investigators had served search warrants at the nursing home to obtain records that may help identify a suspect and had also used mouth swabs to obtain DNA, which he called "one of the key evidentiary factors" in the case.
In a separate development, the San Carlos Apache Tribe said in a statement on Tuesday that the woman at the center of the case is an "enrolled member" of the tribe.
Speaking on behalf of the tribe, its chairman, Terry Rambler, said he was "deeply shocked and horrified."
"When you have a loved one committed to palliative care, when they are most vulnerable and dependent upon others, you trust their caretakers," Mr. Rambler said. "It is my hope that justice will be served."
A lawyer for the woman's family, John A. Micheaels, said in a statement on Tuesday that the baby was a boy who "has been born into a loving family and will be well cared for."
"The family obviously is outraged, traumatized and in shock by the abuse and neglect of their daughter at Hacienda HealthCare," Mr. Micheaels said, adding that they did not wish to make a public statement.
The Arizona Department of Health Services said it was aware of the allegations and would conduct an inspection of the center, which is about seven miles south of downtown Phoenix. It specializes in the care of people with intellectual disabilities and has at least 74 patient beds, according to federal records.
Records posted to the Medicare website indicate that the facility received a "below average" rating from health inspectors in 2017. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rated its quality of resident care as "much below average."
Episodes in which incapacitated patients are raped and become pregnant are not unprecedented, though they are rare.
In 1996, a woman from Rochester, who had been in a coma for a decade after a car accident, gave birth to a two-pound baby boy. When her belly began swelling, workers at the care facility in Brighton, N.Y., tested her for intestinal blockages but later determined through DNA testing that she had been assaulted by a nursing assistant, who was found guilty of rape and imprisoned.
Experts at the time said that was the country's first recorded episode of a woman in a chronic vegetative state giving birth. The case drew additional attention because the parents of the woman, whose name was Kathy, chose to allow the pregnancy to continue and eventually adopted the child. Kathy died before the boy's first birthday.
New York State subsequently passed "Kathy's Law" in 1998, which imposed stiffer penalties for health care workers found guilty of abusing patients in nursing homes.
That same year, a woman in a coma at a home in Massachusetts gave birth to a baby girl prematurely and with severe brain damage. According to a report by The Associated Press at the time, the police asked for blood samples from male employees and a registered nurse's aide was later convicted of rape and sent to prison.

Texto completo: Even after two years of the current administration, the gall of the President never ceases to amaze me. Earlier this week, the President attempted to empathize with unpaid or furloughed federal workers saying he "can relate" to their financial issues resulting from the partial government shutdown. His confidence in the compassion of bill collectors and their ability to "make adjustments" for the 800,000 federal employees affected is absurd. The President fails to realize the difference between choosing not to pay the bills and not being able to pay the bills. It is hard to believe someone "can relate" when, according to a New York Times article, by age 3, the President was earning $200,000 a year in today's dollars from his father's empire. As Congressional leaders remain at a stalemate with the White House, the President threatens to declare a national state of emergency to bypass Congress and use federal funds to build a wall along our southern border. The emergency remains in the homes of American citizens, including nearly 5,000 federal workers in the state of Ohio. Not at our border.
It is day 19 of the partial shutdown, and the President is blocking dedicated and loyal federal workers from receiving their pay. The US Office of Personnel Management provided sample letters for employees to submit to their creditors, mortgage companies or landlords. Even if borrowers, homeowners and renters have success with those letters, how will they feed their families, heat their homes, or keep the lights on? These are the concerns of our federal workers. Not a wall.
This week, the House will consider four appropriations bills so the government can reopen. These Democratic bills, which are virtually identical to legislation that has already passed the Senate by a 92-6 vote, will reopen closed agencies and stop some of the Trump Shutdown's worst impacts on families, businesses, and communities.
The Agriculture bill will protect SNAP (commonly called food stamps), benefits, resume food safety inspections, and provide assistance to farmers already hit hard by the President's trade war. The Financial Services bill allows the Small Business Administration to approve loans and guarantee applications from commercial banks and small businesses. The measure will reopen the IRS and allow the agency to answer tax questions and process refunds that many rely on this time of year.
The Interior-Environment bill reopens America's National Parks and the Environmental Protection Agency, beginning the clean-up of our parks and restarting critical environmental inspections that protect public health. The Transportation - Housing and Urban Development bill restores services for homebuyers and renters. The shutdown has raised concerns of possible evictions and severe slowdowns with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans.
The administration promised Americans would not pay for the wall. Now, we are paying for the border wall with more than our tax dollars. We are paying with our livelihoods, our children's well-being and our communities and country's safety. Our federal employees and America deserve better.
Have a great week!

Texto completo: I see other outlets using a pic of the kid — can we see if we can find one? /aegA Kurdish militia backed by the U.S. claims that an American teenager was one of eight suspected Islamic State terrorists recently captured in Syria.

The Kurdish People’s Protection Units, known as YPG, announced Wednesday that 16-year-old Soulay Noah Su had been captured as part of operations on Jan. 6 and 7. Other alleged terrorists from Russia, Ukraine, Germany, Kazakhistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan were also captured during the operations.

According to the YPG, which is backed by the U.S., the men were composing attacks designed to hinder progress of Kurdish forces “by attacking civilians as a last resort.”

A State Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the agency was aware of the reports, but did not provide additional comment.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner .

The Syrian Democratic Forces, also backed by the U.S., announced earlier this week that two American ISIS fighters had been captured. One of the Americans, Warren Christopher Clark, 34, reportedly had applied for a position to teach English to students in ISIS, per the New York Times.

Texto completo: TALKING PAST EACH OTHER: Teleprompter Trump delivered the presidential address to the nation last night on what he called “a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.” President Trump was lacking the spontaneity and energy of his extemporaneous media availabilities, but his arguments were all familiar.


“Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.”


“As part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need.”


“The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: Because Democrats will not fund border security … The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.”


“This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.”


POINT, COUNTERPOINT: The Democrats, represented by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schume r, delivered the response from Capitol Hill. The pair stood behind a lectern against a backdrop of American flags and evoking the grim countenance of Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” painting.


“House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to re-open government and fund smart, effective border security solutions,” Pelosi said, leading off. “But the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills, which would re-open government, over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall, a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.”


“The fact is, we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values. We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry. We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.”


“We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage,” said Schumer when his turn came. “Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.”


“We can secure our border without an ineffective, expensive wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security. The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall. So, our suggestion is a simple one: Mr. President, re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security.”


NO STATE OF EMERGENCY: The president’s almost 10-minute Oval Office address contained no declaration a national emergency and use of military construction funds to pay for the extension of the current 654 miles of walls, fencing, and barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.


Diverting money needed to renovate sub-standard facilities for military families is not a popular notion among Republicans in Congress. In a session with reporters yesterday Rep. Mac Thornberry , R-Texas, the former chairman and now ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said he remains “opposed to using defense dollars for nondefense purposes.” Building a wall isn’t “a responsibility of the Department of Defense,” he added.


The repair and upkeep of military facilities is one thing deferred during the years of sequestration. Much of the deferred maintenance is only now being done.


“Last fall, I vividly remember touring a barracks with mold growing out of the ceiling where they had to evacuate the soldiers out of certain rooms,” Thornberry told reporters, according to The Hill. “And as much as we’ve done the last two years, we have not made up for that deficit in military construction that does affect readiness, that does affect the quality of life and all sorts of things. So, to take some of that money and use it for something other than [military construction] will obviously be damaging, and I’m not for that.”


WHAT’S THE ANSWER? Thornberry suggested good, old fashioned compromise. “If this were a ‘normal’ controversy, one side says 'zero,' another side says 'five,' you meet in the middle at two-and-a-half,” he said. “Those things get resolved that way every day around here.”


There is another possibility if Trump and the Democrats can’t agree. It would take 67 votes in the Senate to pass a bill re-opening the government with a veto-proof margin.

HAPPENING TODAY: Democrats plan to call up the first of seven bills that would reopen portions of the government but without any of the border wall funding that Trump wants. All told, the bills would fund nine agencies and departments that closed Dec. 22 at midnight and left 800,000 federal employees poised to miss paychecks beginning Friday.


But House Republicans say they expect most of their caucus members to vote against the bills, and — at least for now — won't buckle to Democratic pressure to abandon Trump's push for a border barrier funding


“I think our conference is united,” Republican Conference Vice Chairman Mark Walker of North Carolina told the Washington Examiner, adding that maybe a dozen or so Republicans could vote for the first of several bills that will come up today.


THE RELUCTANT WARRIOR: In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors, which apparently didn’t stay off the record for long, President Trump reportedly predicted his Oval Office address and his planned border visit to Texas tomorrow would be a waste of time but said he had been talked into it by advisers.


“It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” The New York Times quoted Trump as saying of the border visit, according to one person who was in the room.


The trip was merely a photo opportunity, Trump reportedly said. “But,” he added, gesturing at his communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, “These people behind you say it’s worth it,” according to Times reporter Peter Baker .


POMPEO IN BAGHDAD: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has just shown up in Iraq in an unannounced stop on his Mideast tour. Pompeo’s arrival in Baghdad was reported by the Iraqi news channel Al-Sharqiya and the Saudi state broadcaster Al-Arabiya, the AP reports.


The State Department did not immediately confirm Pompeo was in Baghdad and had no comment about the reports.


In his visit to Iraq last month, President Trump said U.S. could use its 5,200 U.S. troops at bases in Iraq as a platform for continued operations against the Islamic State group in Syria.


AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL DOWNSIZED: Several thousand fewer U.S. troops may be withdrawn from Afghanistan than originally suggested by White House officials, The Washington Post reported yesterday. Planning continues to cut the current deployment roughly in half, but the Post quotes two senior White House officials as saying the withdrawal will “probably” be far fewer than 7,000.


“Military advisers have convinced him that a smaller, and slower, withdrawal is best for now — although officials cautioned that a final decision had not been reached and that the president could order a full pullout at any moment,” the Post said.


Asked for comment Col. Rob Manning , a Pentagon spokesman said simply, “The Department of Defense remains in support of Ambassador [Zalmay] Khalilzad's reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan.” Talks with the Taliban have been postponed a week in a dispute over the agenda and are now set to resume Jan. 15.


BOEING BOOSTER? Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is being accused of subtly promoting his former employer, even as he has recused himself from any decision involving Boeing, where he worked for more than 30 years. Politico is reporting that people who have witnessed Shanahan's private remarks say he is boosting Boeing, raising questions about whether he harbors an unfair bias against other big military contractors.


Politico says Shanahan’s recusal “hasn't stopped him from praising Boeing and trashing competitors such as Lockheed Martin during internal meetings,” quoting two former government officials who say they heard his remarks.


“The remarks raise questions among ethics experts about whether Shanahan, intentionally or not, is putting his finger on the scale when it comes to Pentagon priorities,” Politico says. “They also call new attention to a recent decision by the Pentagon to request new Boeing fighters that the Air Force has said it does not want — a request that Bloomberg has reported came after ‘prodding’ from Shanahan.”


Politico reported that in one meeting Shanahan, called Lockheed Martin’s F-35 “f---ed up” and argued that Lockheed — which edged out Boeing to win the competition to build the plane in October 2001 — “doesn’t know how to run a program.”


“If it had gone to Boeing, it would be done much better,” Shanahan said, according to a former official.


SHANAHAN GETS HIS OWN CHIEF: The Pentagon announced yesterday that Eric Chewning , a top Defense Department official who reports to the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer Ellen Lord , has been named the chief of staff to acting Secretary Shanahan. Chewning is replacing retired Rear Adm. Kevin Sweeney , who announced Saturday he was stepping down from his post and would return to the private sector.


KIM HEADS HOME: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un’s train has left Beijing for the 14-hour trip back to Pyongyang, according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency. Kim spent two days in the Chinese capital at the invitation of President Xi Jinping .


There are no details of Kim’s meeting with Xi, which is believed to have been a precursor to a second summit between Kim and President Trump later this year.


TURKEY TURMOIL: America’s contentious relationship with NATO ally Turkey continues, as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has flatly rejected the conditions that U.S. national security adviser John Bolton has put on the planned U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.


In Jerusalem Monday, Bolton said the U.S. departure would be delayed until ISIS was fully defeated, and Turkey guaranteed the security of the Syrian Democratic Forces that are backed by the U.S. Turkey considers the YPG militia, which makes up part of the U.S.-backed forces fighting ISIS, to be terrorists.


“Bolton has made a serious mistake and whoever thinks like this has also made a mistake,” Erdogan said, according to Hurriyet Daily News. “It is not possible for us to make compromises on this point.”


Yesterday Erdogan, who clearly believes he had a deal with President Trump, indicated he might wait to launch his offensive against Kurds in the north of Syria. “Very soon, we will take action to neutralize terrorist organizations in Syria,” Erdogan said.


Erdogan did not meet with Bolton in Ankara yesterday and instead denounced him in a televised address to members of his political party. “The message that Bolton gave in Israel is unacceptable. It is not possible for us to swallow,” Erdogan said.


ZINNI EXITS: Retired four-star Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni , who previously led U.S. Central Command, announced yesterday he’s resigned from his post at the State Department, where he was tasked with resolving the conflict in Qatar. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt severed ties with Qatar in June 2017 after it was suspected Qatar had financially assisted terrorist groups.


Zinni told CBS News he stepped down because he did “not feel I could successfully help resolve the Qatar dispute because of the unwillingness of the regional leaders to agree to a viable mediation effort that we offered to conduct or assist in implementing.” Zinni was for the position by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.


SERVICEMEMBERS INVESTIGATED: Two U.S. Marines and a Navy corpsman assigned to a Marine Special Operations unit in northern Iraq are being investigated over the death of a defense contractor during a New Year's Eve fight. The contractor, who worked for Lockheed Martin, was transported from Erbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, to Landstuhl, Germany, and was pronounced dead on Jan. 4, Pentagon officials told The New York Times. The investigation is the latest of several into deadly misconduct among elite U.S. forces. In November, two Navy SEALs and two Marines were charged with murdering Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar, who was found strangled in Mali in 2017.

We've got more hippos in Downtown

Texto completo: River horses are stealing the spotlight on yet another Cincinnati stage.
Yup, the hippos are here. Again.
We've got a twirling trio now via a new Joshua Stout mural at the corner of the Eighth and Main streets. (For reference, this is the Algin Furniture building near Arnold's Bar and Grill.)
These bright beauties in pink tutus and flower crowns prance on that brick wall. And remarkably, this is not Cincinnati's first ballerina hippo in the last month or so.
Yup, the Queen City's – and arguably, the world's – most famous hippopotamus, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden's Fiona, stole the show during the Cincinnati Ballet's recent "Nutcracker" performances at Music Hall. That elegant hippo was more than six-feet tall and also wore a pink tutu.
And we don't think that is a coincidence.
Even if it is, this mural marks the second painted hippo tribute in Downtown.
This summer, ArtWorks and the Cincinnati Zoo partnered to produce a Fiona mural now up at 910 Race St. This Lucie Rice design honors the premature Nile hippopotamus that beat the odds to survive and thrive.
Since Fiona's birth Jan. 24, 2017, the Nile hippo has raised the profile of her species here and, well, everywhere.
She became a social media darling.
Millions around the world watched her grow from a dangerously small 29-pound newborn to the now healthy hippo tipping the scales at 1,000 pounds.
Fiona became so popular she got her own "show" on Facebook. She was a New York Times Style section cover and a punchline on a late-night talk show. Her face graced thousands of beer cans and ice cream cones and T-shirts and playing cards.
She even inspired an online campaign for her to be Time's Person of the Year for 2017.
And with her second birthday coming up in just a few days, it doesn't appear that the hippo craze is fading any time soon.
These hippos prance on the wall near Arnold's.

Texto completo: Mason Moyle, who owns Keg & Cow in Cape Coral, was perfectly primed to launch his own restaurant.
The 26-year-old Michigan native started in restaurants right out of college when he moved to Madison, Wisconsin and began working for the corporate stores of Mr. Brews Taphouse, a burger and beer chain popular in lower and central Wisconsin.
"I worked my way through the company," Moyle said.
"I started as a cook then went from cook to server to bartender to corporate auditor. There really wasn't a whole lot I didn't do."
In 2016, the corporate owner of Mr. Brews Taphouse decided to launch a location in Cape Coral, and when Moyle was asked to open the restaurant, he jumped at the opportunity.
His previous experience with all the levels of Mr. Brews served him well.
"I like to be really hands-on," he said, "and I like to know how to do everything in the restaurant. If it's busy and the kitchen gets backed up, I'll hop on the line and crank out tickets. I like to be able to help everyone."
In late 2018, Moyle decided he wanted to change a few things in the format of his restaurant. After talks with the corporate headquarters of Mr. Brews, he decided to go out on his own and re-branded his restaurant as Keg & Cow.
"I still have a great relationship with Mr. Brews," Moyle said.
"We mutually agreed that I wanted to do my own thing by changing up the menu, and they were very receptive. It was a very mutual decision to both go our own ways."
The space inside Keg & Cow is much the same as it was under Mr. Brews, though a touch cozier, Moyle said. The most notable updates are to the menu.
"The menu change, that's the thing we were really excited about," said Moyle.
"Being able to play with the menu and to have a seasonal menu. We're still beer and burgers, but we were able to add a lot more salads and sandwiches, play around with appetizers and change up the desserts. We also added more house-made sauces."
On the new menu, one of the most popular items is the Bourbon Barrel Burger, which is drizzled with a root-beer bourbon mayonnaise made in-house.
"It's awesome," Moyle said. "My personal favorite."
Other popular dishes include the Cowlifornia Burger with pepper jack cheese, house-made guacamole and chipotle lime sauce, as well as the beer-battered onion rings, pretzels and cheese curds. The restaurant also has 48 beers on tap, with at least half dedicated to local beer, including Southwest Florida breweries such as Fort Myers Brewing, Palm City Brewing and Scotty's Bierwerks.
The new menu has gone over well, Moyle said, as has the shift to Keg & Cow.
"The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It's been a really, really fun transition. We had two cool years as Mr. Brews, and now we get to fully do something new," Moyle said. "It's still a friendly place with a cozy atmosphere. We love talking to people about beer and sports, and we love serving great food."

How a Trump "national emergency" declaration to build border wall could put Mitch McConnell in a bind

Texto completo: As we await President Trump's primetime speech on Tuesday night, one open question remains whether he's going to pitch the possibility of declaring a "national emergency" to justify appropriating the military to build a border wall. I've already explained why I think such an action would be dangerous, but it's also worth taking a moment to consider the politics of such a maneuver.

In a analysis that appeared in the New York Times in which Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman mainly focuses on the legal implications of such a move, he notes that under the 1976 National Emergencies Act:

"If President Trump declared an emergency, Section Five of the act gives the House of Representatives the right to repudiate it immediately, then pass their resolution to the Senate — which is explicitly required to conduct a floor vote within 15 days. "

It would be pretty clear that in such a case, assuming Ackerman's interpretation of prevailing law is accurate, that the Democratic House would quickly repudiate Trump.

But then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be put in a bind. On the one hand, he wouldn't want to anger Trump's base and be scapegoated for the wall not getting built. On the other hand, there's much less enthusiasm for the wall among the public at large than there is among the base -- let alone the idea of using emergency powers. More sober minded conservative Senators would also (hopefully) recognize the potential dangers that such a precedent would set were Trump to go this route. My guess is that McConnell would want to avoid this scenario.

Gun deaths soar to new all-time high

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.

Campaign journalism is way off course - and not likely to change

Texto completo: As the new year dawned, the top editor at the Associated Press - one of the most influential journalists in the country - was making a resolution.
"We should all resolve to spend less time, or perhaps no time at all, on horse race polls that project forward to the 2020 presidential election," Sally Buzbee said on CNN's "Reliable Sources."
The Atlantic's James Fallows responded to her pledge by tweeting an Amen: "No poll right now is worth anything. Who 'should' run? Anyone who wants to try. The best way to tell who's 'likable'/'electable' is to listen to them and see how primaries turn out."
Buzbee herself said she doubted news organizations, including the AP, would heed her words.
As the presidential election season kicked off in earnest this month, it was obvious the media would do what it always has done: focus on personalities and electability, and blow gaffes way out of proportion. (I researched this in early 2016 while New York Times public editor; in a fairly typical two-week period, three out of every four pieces of political journalism was horse race coverage.)
You can see it happening again, already. News organizations were agog at Elizabeth Warren's video in which she began to lay out her substantial ideas but then awkwardly declared a brief pause - "I'm gonna get me a beer."
CBS News, among many others, found this last part newsworthy, tweeting: "Sen. Elizabeth Warren drank a beer on Instagram Live - and it received mixed reactions." Boston Herald columnist Jaclyn Cashman (amusingly) teed off on it.
Nearly every news organization published articles on Warren's personality and gender, comparing her to Hillary Clinton. Then commentators wrote meta-pieces on all this. But none of that had much to do with acquainting voters with what Warren stands for.
The press critic and New York University professor Jay Rosen may have a better idea. He says the mission of pre-election coverage should not be to determine who's going to win, but to respond intelligently to what voters want and need to know. It's so simple it seems absurd that the reality is so far from it. Rosen writes on his PressThink blog that one of the problems with election coverage as it stands is that no one has any idea what it means to succeed at it.
"Predicting the winner? Is that success? Even if journalists could do that (and they can't) it would not be much of a public service, would it? A very weird thing about horse race or 'game' coverage is it doesn't answer to any identifiable need of the voter. Should I vote for the candidate with the best strategy for capturing my vote?"
What Rosen calls the "citizens agenda," which he says was once tried to good effect by the Charlotte Observer partnering with the Poynter Institute, asks different questions: "What do you want the candidates to be discussing as they compete for votes?"
From the best answers to that, everything else flows.
Rosen knows this all sounds dorky and not much fun. But given we're in an extreme situation these days - with a president dismissive of democratic norms and commanding the news cycle with a wave of his hand - such ideas take on new urgency.
Meanwhile, the clock is already ticking toward November of next year. Ticking toward what may be the most consequential election in American history, other than the last one - before which news organizations for the most part failed to serve the public interest.
Obsessed with polls, they still called the election wrong. They helped crown the Democratic Party's favored nominee, Hillary Clinton, literally years before the party convention. They allowed Donald Trump to dominate coverage as he wished. They focused on personality flaws and minor mistakes while failing to effectively drive home obvious character disasters.
The prospect of repetition is grim but, from the early signs, all too likely.

Maine Democrats ride wave of campaign cash

Texto completo: Maine Democrats may not be too worried about money in state politics at the moment. After all, they and their allies dominated Republicans in campaign spending this past election cycle on their way to an unquestionable blue wave in Augusta.
Republicans are often cast as the party of deep pockets when it comes to campaign spending. But here in Maine, Democrats and their outside supporters enjoyed a significant fundraising advantage this November over their counterparts on the right.
It was a particularly good fundraising cycle for Democrats here in the state, even as the party's own long-shot candidate for U.S. Senate, Zak Ringelstein, made "get money out of politics" a central message of his candidacy -- and on his campaign signs.
In the 2018 election, state Democrats and their allies spent $35.6 million compared to $21.8 million from Republicans and their supportive outside groups. Democratic fundraising outpaced the competition in key races that ultimately tipped in their favor, with Gov. Janet Mills outraising Republican Shawn Moody by $1.2 million and 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden outraising Bruce Poliquin in the most expensive U.S. House race in Maine's history.
The campaign cash advantage is nothing new for Democrats in Maine, who have won the outside spending battle in state Legislature contests for the past five election cycles. But this year's breakdown was particularly remarkable.
Outside spending, sometimes framed as "dark money" and more frequently targeted by critics on the left, is political spending that advocates for or against a candidate but is not given to a candidate or political party. These "independent expenditures" are not subject to the same level of disclosure requirements as direct contributions to candidates and parties, hence the dark money moniker.
Democrats were bolstered by an outside spending advantage in several key races. Outside spending favored Mills by more than a 2-1 ratio. Golden benefited from more than $3.3 million more outside spending in his race compared to Poliquin's outside backing (which was still substantial). And in one of the most hotly contested and expensive state races, more than $250,000 in outside money supported Democratic Sen. Ned Claxton, compared to less than $100,000 for his District 20 Republican opponent, former Rep. Ellie Espling.
To be clear, it's not just outside spending where state Democrats are surpassing Republicans in campaign cash. Democrats have also smartly embraced state public campaign financing with greater vigor than Republicans.
Nationwide, Democrats have been able to tap into grassroots fundraising from small donors in a more organized and fruitful way than Republicans. As reported by the New York Times, Democrats turned to online fundraising network ActBlue as part of its small donation effort and tripled Republican small donor money $296 million to $85 million. In Maine, ActBlue's statewide arm was the second highest-spending political action committee in 2018 with more than $1.7 million spent. First on that list was the Maine Democratic State Committee, which dedicated nearly $3.8 million this election to expenditures such as campaign worker salaries, mailings and contributions to other candidate and party committees.
National and state Republicans alike have framed that grassroots success as a "green wave" for Democrats, and it's one Republicans are sure to try to replicate in future elections.
Democrats may currently be more willing to decry the influence of money in politics and to advocate for campaign finance reforms, but they are clearly willing to engage and thrive in the current campaign finance system that they sometimes criticize. And here in Maine, they're doing it quite well.

Texto completo: KANSAS CITY, Mo. - An algorithm predicts where potholes will emerge so road crews can resurface streets before cracks appear. Dog houses outfitted with cameras and temperature controls provide people a place to leave pets while they're on a date or at yoga. And on Main Street, if a driver parks too long, a sensor alerts the police and a ticket is issued.
In recent months, Kansas City has become an unexpected destination for technology companies looking for a place to test ideas. The city's goal: To be what it calls a living lab.
Far from technology centers on the coasts, Kansas City and dozens of other cities have begun competing for federal grant dollars and tech company attention. They want to remake themselves as "smart cities," where technology is seen as a tool to help grow, improve school systems and air quality, and make traffic move faster.
"People are starting to notice us," the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Sly James, said. "We have people coming to town thinking there are going to be cows and tumbleweeds and coming away with a whole other idea."
Hundreds of cities, large and small, have adopted or begun planning smart cities projects. But the risks are daunting. Experts say cities frequently lack the expertise to understand the privacy, security and financial implications of such arrangements. Some mayors acknowledge that they have yet to master the responsibilities that go along with collecting billions of bits of data from residents.
Concerns have intensified as Kansas City prepares to expand its technology experiment from downtown to poor neighborhoods on the city's East Side. The expansion will bring free wireless to homes, but also dozens of surveillance cameras and a gunshot detection system, and some residents worry that in the quest to be seen as forward thinking, the city may be handing off too much control to private companies and opening up residents to consequences it doesn't fully understand.
"We increasingly see every problem as a technology-related problem, so the solution is more technology," said Ben Green, a Harvard University graduate student who studies cities and technology. "And you have cities, which are caught in this devil's bargain, where they feel they don't have the resources to provide the services people need, and so they make these deals with tech companies that have money, but which in the long term might not be beneficial to either them or their residents."
In Seattle, officials this year began to dismantle a network of surveillance cameras and wireless devices that the police had deemed vital in fighting crime, but that drew complaints over the network's ability to track cellphones.
Several government officials in Toronto were fired this month after they tried to rush through a large technology project proposed by a company affiliated with Google.
And high-tech criminals have also presented problems: In Atlanta, hackers broke into the City Hall network this year and demanded a ransom to unlock it.
Supporters of "smart cities" say that the potential is enormous and that some projects could go beyond creating efficiencies and actually save lives. Among the plans under development are augmented reality programs that could help firefighters find people trapped in burning buildings and the collection of sewer samples by robots to determine opioid use so that city services could be aimed at neighborhoods most in need.
Cities habitually feel compelled to outdo each other, but the competition has now been intensified by lobbying from tech companies and federal inducements to modernize.
"There is incredible pressure on an unenlightened city to be a 'smart city,'" said Ben Levine, executive director at MetroLab Network, a nonprofit organization that helps cities adapt to technology change.
That has left Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities testing self-driving cars and Orlando, Florida, trying to harness its sunshine to power electric vehicles. San Francisco has a system that tracks bicycle traffic, while Palm Beach, Florida, uses cycling data to decide where to send street sweepers. Boise, Idaho, monitors its trash dumps with drones. Arlington, Texas, is looking at creating a transit system based on data from ride-sharing apps.
Kansas City is trying to position itself as the most forward-thinking of all.
It has promoted its use of technology with aggressive marketing, proclaiming itself the nation's "smartest city." It has hosted international conferences, offered advice to other cities, and its tech guru, Bob Bennett, has become the public face of a smart cities movement.
"Cities that fail to embrace technology today, that fail to embrace a data-driven approach, those cities will be in the digital Rust Belt 20 years from now," Bennett said.
Much of Kansas City's progress stemmed from its selection in 2011 as the first metropolitan area to get Google Fiber, an ultrafast internet and television service. Then five years ago, it was approached by Cisco Systems, the tech giant.
At the time, Kansas City was digging a trench under Main Street for a streetcar line. Cisco told officials that since there would be a hole in the street anyway, the city might as well install fiber optic cable and electronic sensors to monitor traffic.
The sensors, Cisco argued, would help City Hall understand how the city behaves in an unobtrusive way, and at relatively little cost.
The city also built 25 kiosks along the 2.2-mile streetcar line to provide tourist information and installed public Wi-Fi. It installed surveillance cameras and LED streetlights also outfitted with video cameras.
The city borrowed much of its $3.7 million portion of the cost. Sprint, which manages the Wi-Fi network, contributed about $7 million, while Cisco invested $5 million.
There was no competitive bidding.
The city's downtown corridor now monitors nearly everything that happens along this stretch of road - cars, pedestrians and parking spaces. The wireless system has been used by 2.7 million people.
But some results have been modest. Despite sensors linked to traffic signals, motorists have saved only an average of 37 seconds from their commutes, according to the city. And a crime location predictor with an algorithm that takes into account everything from 911 calls to weather patterns has yet to reduce assaults in the city's entertainment district.
Sprint collects data from users who log onto the wireless network, including their home ZIP codes, internet searches and location.
Some of the information - including phone numbers and other potentially identifying information - is available even if one does not log on to the wireless network, city officials and data experts said.
Sprint declined to discuss the data it collects or how it uses it. But the company said its work was critical in cities like Kansas City, where people want access to the latest technology.
"People are ready for smart things," said Patricia Watkins, Sprint's director of emerging solutions. "For the first time, instead of asking why we're doing this, they're asking, 'Why can't we do this?' It will force cities to move ahead with these things because their constituents will be asking for it."
On Kansas City's East Side, officials hope to extend the wireless system to reach homes of about 80,000 residents along Prospect Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares in the neighborhood. Only about 40 percent of homes there have internet access.
The city says it wants to transform the neighborhood, which has a high crime rate and is dotted with vacant buildings. It plans to install air quality sensors, water meters to detect leaks, a bus line, surveillance cameras and a gunshot detection system.
Some residents thought the changes would bring an economic boost to the area.
"I'm just elated," said Cheryl Barnes, president of a local residents' group. "It will provide a measure of hope to the neighborhood."
Quinton Lucas, who represents the East Side on the City Council, said while the project represented "a psychological investment in the area," he worried about all the surveillance.
"I have a concern about monitoring inner cities in a different way than other neighborhoods," he said. "Is this going to accrue to the detriment of young Black men?"
Lucas said he wondered whether Kansas City was moving too fast.
"When you look at the amount of change in the world - and basically we're operating on a hunch
- how are we sure if we are getting the best deal available?" he said.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: Rates
Rooms start at $139, plus a daily $12.95 "resort" fee.
The Basics
Once a private mansion and for many years the Peabody Court Hotel, the Revival opened in early 2018, after a nearly two-year renovation led by the hotel's owners, NuoveRE, and its new management team, the San Francisco-based Joie de Vivre. It has quickly established itself as a neighborhood hot spot, with a buzzing rooftop restaurant, three private karaoke rooms and a fashionable crowd hanging out in the bookshelf-lined lobby. But not all went smoothly on a recent stay. When I arrived in the early afternoon, there was no one at the front desk, just another guest waiting to check in. While she went off in search of a manager, the clerk returned, coffee in hand, having apparently made a quick trip to the hotel's cafe. The check-in process went quickly from there, however, and the clerk made up for the wait by moving me to a higher floor, where my room had a sliver of a view of the 178-foot-tall Washington Monument, a neighborhood landmark, as well as of Mount Vernon Place, which Paul Goldberger, a former architecture critic for The New York Times, once described as "one of the finest downtown squares in the United States."
The Location
The 107-room hotel is ideally situated in the Mount Vernon neighborhood, one of the loveliest parts of Baltimore, and one with a rich cultural history. The Walters Art Museum, with a superb private art collection, is just a block away (and free!), as is the Peabody Library. The first Catholic cathedral in the United States and the church where the Unitarian movement was founded are both within a short walk, and the house where F. Scott Fitzgerald finished "Tender Is the Night" is about 15 minutes away. The immediate neighborhood is home to a wide variety of ethnic restaurants -- ranging from Ethiopian to Vietnamese -- and the hotel is a quick cab ride or a 20-minute stroll from the Amtrak train station.
The Room
My 12th-floor room was basic but pleasantly furnished, its distressed wood floor partly covered by a mottled blue-and-white rug, and with a small seating area off to the side, complete with two free bottles of water, copies of local magazines and a strong reading light. The bed was firm and comfortable, with an upholstered wooden bench at its foot, but was missing a blanket, which I thought I might need on what was forecast to be a chilly December night. I called down to the front desk to have one sent up, and was told it would soon be on its way. But when I returned from dinner several hours later, it had still not arrived. (I decided just to crank up the heat and go to bed.) There was a minibar in the room, but it was empty.
The Bathroom
Small but efficiently designed, with a full bathtub in addition to the shower. The bath products were by Jonathan Adler, all in a fragrant combination of citrus and sandalwood. There was excellent water pressure from the shower head.
Dining
Topside, the top floor bar and restaurant, with its glass walls giving a panoramic view of the city below, is a popular draw for locals and guests alike. On a recent Saturday evening, the bar was packed and every table had been booked for dinner. (Reservations are essential on the weekends.) One draw seems to be the extensive list of specialty cocktails and 13 offerings of locally brewed draft beer. Dining options ranged from striped bass yakitori ($14) to braised rabbit with butter beans, bacon, kale and apples ($29). In the morning, the room service menu was limited to just four choices (among them almond milk oatmeal and eggs with homemade sausage) so I decided to go down to the Square Meal, the ground floor "farm-inspired" restaurant. The room resembled an upscale college cafeteria (you had to line up at the counter to place your order) and the menu was basically the same as the one in my room, with the notable addition of some freshly baked muffins. But my breakfast -- I went with the eggs and sausage ($13) -- arrived 11 minutes after I ordered and was quite tasty. The orange juice was fresh; the flat white coffee expertly prepared. And it turned out I had made the right call. As I was paying my bill, another guest arrived and said he wanted to place a room service order. "No problem," the hostess replied, "but you know, you could have used the phone in your room to call us." "I did," he replied. "No one ever picked up."
Amenities
The hotel has a 24-hour gym, accessible by room key, with two treadmills, an elliptical machine and free weights. Use of the gym is included in the $12.95 daily resort fee -- which I noticed on my bill after I checked out -- as was the "free" Wi-Fi and those bottles of water in my room.
Bottom Line
Location. Location. Location. The Revival has some kinks to work out, particularly in service, but the surrounding Mount Vernon neighborhood is an alluring weekend destination and this elegant but slightly flawed hotel is ideally situated to explore it.

Texto completo: Boomer music fans of the ‘70s took a double hit this week.
Daryl Dragon, the ‘‘Captain’’ half of the pop duo the Captain & Tennille, whose string of soft-rock hits in the 1970s included ‘‘Love Will Keep Us Together’’ and ‘‘Muskrat Love,’’ died Wednesday in Prescott, Arizona. He was 76.
And on Monday in Daytona Beach, Ray Sawyer, the eyepatch-wearing frontman of the band Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show, died at age 81.
Dragon’s former wife and singing partner, Toni Tennille, announced his death through a publicist, who said the cause was renal failure.
The Captain & Tennille, whose specialty was romantic ballads featuring Tennille’s silky voice, reached the Top 10 seven times between 1975 and 1979.
‘‘He was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly,’’ Tennille said in a statement. ‘‘I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.’’
Dragon’s stage name came from his days as a backup musician with the Beach Boys in the 1960s and early ‘70s, when he often wore a captain’s hat onstage. Mike Love, one of the group’s leaders, would introduce him to audiences as the ‘‘captain of the keyboards.’’
Dragon co-wrote the Beach Boys song “Cuddle Up” with late drummer-singer Dennis Wilson, and paired with Wilson under the name “Dennis Wilson & Rumbo” for two songs that have become cult favorites of Beach Boys fans: “Sound of Free” and “Lady.”
Dragon had been performing with the Beach Boys for several years before the hat made its fateful appearance.
‘‘I just picked it up one night on the spur of the moment,’’ he told The Boston Globe in 1976, ‘‘and that night they spotlighted me in ‘Help Me Rhonda.’ It made a big hit, and I’ve been wearing it ever since.’’
His passing was mourned online by Love, singers Lisa Loeb and Neil Sedaka, and Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson, who tweeted: “Daryl was a great guy and a hell of a musician and keyboard player. I feel very bad about this.”
Daryl Dragon was born on Aug. 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. His father, Carmen, was a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise (Rawitzer) Dragon, was a soprano who sang on radio programs.
Dragon was trained in classical piano but didn’t take to it.
‘‘I seemed to be at war with myself in my musical tastes,’’ he told The Globe. ‘‘I could appreciate the great compositions, but I also liked the boogie beat.’’
He played in several bands in the 1960s before signing on with the Beach Boys. He met Tennille in 1971 when he was brought in to play keyboards for the San Francisco run of an ecology-themed musical, ‘‘Mother Earth,’’ that she had co-written and in which she was performing with South Coast Repertory, a theater company from Orange County, California. He in turn brought her onto a Beach Boys tour as a backup singer and pianist.
The two began performing together in nightclubs, and after they self-financed a demo they landed a record contract. Their cover of ‘‘Love Will Keep Us Together,’’ a song Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield had written and Sedaka had recorded in 1973, became a worldwide hit in 1975, reaching No.1 on the Billboard singles chart and winning the Grammy Award for record of the year. They kept turning out hits for the rest of the 1970s.
They also landed a television variety show on ABC as the network tried to duplicate the success Sonny and Cher had enjoyed with their own show earlier in the decade.
But the series, which had its premiere in September 1976, lasted only one season. Dragon found the whole experience distasteful.
‘‘Television is a great garbage disposal,’’ he said at the time. ‘‘It keeps grinding up artists like us and throwing them away.’’
Dragon produced all 10 of the duo’s 10 albums. They were the first to record Beach Boy Bruce Johnston’s “I Write The Songs,” but it became a hit for Barry Manilow. They continued to perform after their hit-making run ended in 1979 — ‘‘Do That to Me One More Time’’ was their last gold record — and Dragon produced other artists.
Tennille, meanwhile, increasingly pursued solo projects.
The couple divorced in 2014. In 2016 Tennille published a memoir in which she wrote that their marriage had not been the idyllic partnership it had been made to seem.
Their record company, she wrote, falsely announced that they had married on Valentine’s Day 1975; to satisfy expectations, they married for real not long after.
‘‘I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,’’ she wrote.
Dragon is survived by a brother, Doug.
***
He didn’t wear a hat like the Captain. He sported an eyepatch.
Guitarist and singer Ray Sawyer was the face of Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show as they produced several hits in the 1970s.
His agent, Mark Lyman, said Sawyer died in his sleep Monday in Daytona Beach after a brief illness.
Lyman declined to give a cause of death Wednesday out of respect for his family’s privacy.
Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show’s hits included “Sylvia’s Mother,” ‘’When You’re in Love with a Beautiful Woman,” and “The Cover of ‘Rolling Stone.’”
Sawyer wore a patch over his right eye after suffering an injury from a car accident as a young man.
Lyman says Sawyer toured up until two years ago.
Editor’s Note: The Dragon obituary was mostly written by Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times with supplementary online material, while the Ray Sawyer obituary was written by the Associated Press.

Trump cries 'fake,' but reports keep proving truth

Texto completo: The Trump White House isn't big on sharing information or answering questions asked on behalf of the public.
The so-called daily briefings are not even monthly.
The "communications office specializes in stonewalling, often not even deigning to issue a "no comment.
So, White House correspondents must rely on inside sources, direct observation, documents and other reportorial wiles to perform their jobs: informing citizens about what the executive branch is up to.
When they do, President Donald Trump is quick to trash-talk them.
"The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House, went one broadside after the many departures among his top appointees were reported.
"Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!
But the reporting he criticizes as false - he claims it is invented from sources that don't exist - is validated every time top officials leave the White House staff and give on-the-record interviews.
Take, for instance, an article based on an interview with just-departed chief of staff John Kelly by Molly O'Toole in the Dec. 30 Los Angeles Times, which carried some remarkable headline words: that Kelly's time as Trump's top aide "is best measured by what the president did not do.
That Kelly was, in other words, often in the position of restraining a whimsical and incurious president.
If that sounds more like chaos than "great energy, consider this passage from the same article:
"Kelly faulted the administration for failing to follow procedure and failing to anticipate the public outrage for the two most controversial initiatives of his tenure: Trump's travel ban in January 2017, and the zero tolerance' immigration policy and family separations this year.
"Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order immediately suspending the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely freezing the entry of refugees from Syria and barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.
"Refugees already approved for resettlement, green card holders and others were turned away from flights, detained, and in some cases deported. Federal judges issued emergency stays, and several iterations of the travel ban have been challenged in court.
"At the time, despite reports he'd been caught off-guard by the president's order, Kelly gave a full-throated defense.
" I had very little opportunity to look at them' before the orders were announced, Kelly acknowledged in the Times interview.
In other words, media reports that Kelly, then secretary of Homeland Security, had been caught off-guard by this impetuous blunder were accurate.
And Kelly's defense, at that time, was a charade.
"It's remarkable that Kelly now admits the chaos of travel ban implementation ... when he previously lied to the public and press, CNN senior Justice reporter Evan Perez said, responding on Twitter to the Los Angeles Times interview.
Perez added: "The reporting, it turns out, was spot on. Kelly was lying.
And Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The New York Times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: "The current theme out of some in the WH comms shop is there's no chaos to see in this White House,' a narrative Trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. This Kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there.
This is far from the first time that top Trump officials have validated real-time reporting in after-the-fact interviews.
Just weeks ago, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, in an interview with CBS News' Bob Schieffer, described the president as someone who is "pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, isn't interested in deeply understanding policy decisions, and who repeatedly attempted to do illegal things. (Trump responded by calling Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, "dumb as a rock.)
The situation Tillerson and Kelly have described is far closer to what the mainstream media reported than to what Trump claimed a few months ago: "The White House is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. It is working so well.
This doesn't mean, of course, that every anonymously sourced White House report turns out to be accurate to the letter. (After all, rumors of Kelly's departure circulated for months before he actually departed.)
But it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. Far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality - despite what Trump would have us believe.
In a particularly unhinged-sounding tweet on Tuesday, the president sent New Year's greetings to the nation, including "the fake news media.
Presidential good wishes? Or just wishful thinking?

Texto completo: CBS News "60 Minutes"
Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi told CBS News that Egypt and Israel are cooperating to battle a stubborn Islamic State insurgency in Sinai, and he denied that the tens of thousands of Egyptians jailed since he took power are political prisoners.
Those two statements are newsy but not necessarily new.
It is what happened after he granted the interview to "60 Minutes" in New York that is making headlines.
In a story promoting the sit-down with Sissi, set to air Sunday, CBS says Egypt's ambassador (it was not clear to which country) contacted the "60 Minutes" crew and told them not to air the interview.
CBS did not elaborate on the ambassador's demand, saying only that Sissi's answers "were not the kind of news his government wanted broadcast."
The Egyptian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
The teaser clip for the Sissi interview shows the Egyptian leader denying a Human Rights Watch claim that 60,000 people have been thrown in jail for their political beliefs since the former defense minister seized power in 2014 by overthrowing Egypt's first freely elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Sissi cracks a small smile and tells the interviewer, Scott Pelley, that he has no idea where Human Rights Watch got that figure.
"I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology, we have to intervene regardless of their numbers," he continued.
Sissi has made this false claim before, and the assertion that his opponents are all Islamist extremists has underpinned his nearly five-year rule. But human rights groups and his Egyptian critics point to a far-reaching crackdown on dissent that has ensnared more people than just Muslim Brotherhood supporters - including some of the secular and reform-minded activists who became prominent during the 2011 revolt that unseated longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak.
Many critics have said Sissi is overseeing a period of repression in Egypt that exceeds that of the Mubarak era, which lasted nearly 30 years. Egyptian politicians are agitating to allow Sissi to retain his office beyond the constitutionally mandated two four-year terms.
What could have spooked Sissi and his government was his apparently confirming that Egypt has allowed Israel to conduct airstrikes in the northern Sinai Peninsula, where a low-level insurgency ballooned into a full-fledged campaign of terrorism after Sissi's rise to power.
It is unlikely that Sissi and his top leadership would be nervous about his statements on human rights abuses - his government is unapologetic about its record and has not been held to account for it by any foreign government or the United Nations.
Last February, the New York Times revealed the extent of the cooperation between Egypt and Israel, two former enemies that have since normalized relations despite an unfavorable view of Israel by a vast majority of Egyptians.
When Pelley asked whether "this cooperation with Israel was the closest ever between two enemies that once were at war," Sissi responded: "That is correct. . . . We have a wide range of cooperation with the Israelis."
Reaction to the Sissi interview on social media did not fixate on Sissi's comments but rather the alleged demand that it not be aired.
"Why do autocrats consistently fail to grasp that trying to block access to information increases interest in that information and demonstrates that they are in fact autocrats?" Timothy Kaldas, a Cairo-based Egypt analyst with the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, wrote on Twitter.

Opinion: Court must explain rejection of Brown's pardons

Texto completo: In March 2018 the California Supreme Court published a remarkable order, signed by all six sitting justices, intended to clarify its role in reviewing acts of clemency by the governor. This interesting, nine-page administrative order details the history of California's peculiar restrictions on the pardon powers of our governors, and clearly states that the court does not review the cases on their merits, but confines its overrides to cases "that represent an abuse of power."
No definitions, no rational standards and only a single precedent are provided, but respect is expressed for the executive's "power to grant clemency on whatever grounds he or she deems appropriate" and for separation of powers. The order was created by the court for the court, not the result of a lawsuit or appeal.
As expected, Gov. Jerry Brown has been more generous with pardons and commutations in his final year, and for the first time since 1930, the court has intervened in 10 cases to reject Brown's decision or in legalese, it "declines to recommend" the actions. If we hold the court to its own standards in the March order, we must conclude that it found that Brown has abused his power. I submit that the justices are abusing their discretion in a secretive process that leaves the public to speculate about their motives.
Why, in the most disturbing case, did the court overrule the governor's pardon of Borey Ai, who won parole in 2016, and is now subject to mandatory deportation to Cambodia, the nation his parents fled before he was born? Why did the court consider Brown's reduction of sentences not immediate releases for a number of second-degree murder convictions to meet the vague standard of "abuse of power"? Why did the court OK the pardon for Rod Wright, the former Democratic state senator convicted for lying about living in his district? And how do these cases compare to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's commutation for the son of former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez?
The court has agreed to release the sealed documents from the Wright case, so we can hope to learn more about it. The court should be fully transparent in all of these cases and articulate clear standards to the public and clemency petitioners. It must explain exactly what factors that the governor used to pardon ex-convict Ai that amounted to an abuse of power, requiring their intervention and essentially deciding in favor of Ai's deportation.
Leaving it to legal experts to comment on separation of powers issues, I do see a major conflict of interest, as the court controls the broken process that led these convicts to seek clemency in the first place. We can be sure that almost every one of them has brought numerous appeals that reached the court, and they went to the governor as a last resort. Then, at the final stage, the court cherry-picked 10 of them for rejection with no explanation so far. Did the ghost of former Chief Justice Rose Bird provoke the justices to protect their tough-on-crime image?
As a radio host, and an advocate for wrongfully convicted prisoners, I've had a number of exchanges with Brown about prisons and parole. I think he deserves credit for many reforms, reducing the state prison population and allowing the parole system to work as intended.
He also fixed the sentencing laws he screwed up in the 1970s. But the Bird recall and his stints as Oakland's mayor and the state attorney general left him cautious about being seen as "soft on crime." He has never used his clemency power in a blatantly political move, like President Trump's pardon for Joe Arpaio. And he didn't try to clear death row, as advocated by six former governors in a December New York Times op-ed.
It's an insult to Brown for the court to veto his decisions without any showing of improper motive or abuse of power. And respect for the court is undermined by its secretive and arbitrary actions in these cases.

Texto completo: Andre Berto, a two-time welterweight boxing world champion, is ready to go a few rounds in the Beverly Hills housing market. He's put his modern home in the area on the market for $8.995 million. Built in 2016, the boxy two-story features 12-foot-high ceilings, wide-plank floors and an expansive terrace/patio that spans the upper level. About 4,900 square feet of interior includes an open-plan kitchen and dining area, a living room with a fireplace, five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. The master suite, which has a private patio, is reached by a floating staircase. The house sits on a third of an acre with lawn, mature landscaping and a swimming pool with a spa.
Berto, 35, has twice held the WBC welterweight title and won a bronze medal in 2003 at the World Championships in Bangkok. The Haitian American fighter, whose record is 32-5 with 24 knockouts, in August fought former welterweight champion Devon Alexander, winning the match by split decision. Berto bought the Beverly Hills house a year ago for $6.62 million.
Shaye Sullwold of the Cosmopolitan Group holds the listing.
Designs on a new living space Adam Carolla is swapping styles in La Cañada Flintridge. A few months after listing his Midcentury spread for sale, the comedian has paid $7.327 million for a contemporary-style house in the area. Designed by architect Vaughan Trammell and built in 2013, the house sits at the end of a leafy cul-de-sac. Clean lines, offset roof lines and clerestory windows create visual interest from the street. Inside, stone walls and hardwood floors fill some 7,300 square feet of living space. At the heart of the home, a built-in fireplace warms an indoor-outdoor great room. Picture windows brighten the sky-lit dining room under vaulted ceilings. Other highlights include a step-down living room, a center-island kitchen, a movie theater, a gym and a wine cellar. A dumbwaiter serves all three floors, which hold five bedrooms and six bathrooms. Outside, the nearly one-acre property includes an infinity-edge swimming pool and spa, two fire pits and a grill. There's also a viewing deck.
In addition to his popular podcast, "The Adam Carolla Show," the 54-year-old Carolla has appeared on "The Man Show" and "Catch a Contractor." From 1995 to 2006, he co-hosted the syndicated radio show "Loveline."
Scott James of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage held the listing. Kathy Seuylemezian, also with Coldwell Banker, represented Carolla.
Desert segment comes to an end Sports talk radio host Jim Rome and his wife, Janet, have signed off in Indio, selling their Tuscan-inspired home in a resort community for $2.5 million. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom house, built in 2009, sits on a lakefront lot of about two-thirds of an acre. Designed for outdoor entertaining, the home opens through a gated courtyard with patios and a fireplace. Pocketing walls of glass open to a rear patio with a dining area and a barbecue/bar. A strip of sandy lakefront sits beyond the swimming pool, which has a raised spa. There's also a private boat dock with a lift. Inside the single-story house, living spaces evoke Old World ambiance with thick beams, stonework and reclaimed teak wood and pavers imported from Tuscany and France. A great room with a fireplace adjoins a center-island kitchen. Nearby is a card/game room.
Rome, 54, has been a mainstay on radio airwaves since the mid-1990s with "The Jim Rome Show." More recently he hosted the premium cable sports-talk series "Jim Rome on Showtime" from 2012 to 2015. He was one of 24 on-air personalities nominated earlier this year for the National Radio Hall of Fame.
Jenell VanDenBos of Bennion DeVille Homes represented both ends of the deal.
A full-floor production in NYC Fashion mogul and film producer Sidney Kimmel is looking to make a move on the opposite coast. More than a year after listing the former Johnny Carson estate in Malibu, Kimmel and his wife, Caroline, have put their New York City apartment up for sale at $39.5 million. The roughly 6,800-square-foot residence makes up the entirety of the 27th floor of the Thierry Despont-designed Ritz-Carlton New York residences. Beyond a bronze entry, the unit opens to a gallery that connects each wing. A central bar area connects the living room, which has an antique fireplace, to the wood-paneled office. The corner dining room sits adjacent to the kitchen and has picture windows that capture views of Central Park and the Upper West Side. On another wing, the master suite — measuring some 2,000 square feet — comprises two onyx and marble-clad bathrooms, two dressing rooms, a private office and a sitting room. There are two bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in all.
Sidney Kimmel, 90, is the founder of Jones Apparel Group. His film producing credits include "Moneyball" (2011), "The Place Beyond the Pines" (2012) and "Hell or High Water" (2016). He was an executive producer for the 2018 blockbuster "Crazy Rich Asians," a film based on the Kevin Kwan novel of the same name. The producer and his wife bought the property in 2001 for $22.343 million. Earlier this month, the couple took their Malibu property off the market. It had been listed at $65.2 million.
Steven Cohen, Robert Varvara and Tim Malone of Corcoran Group hold the New York City listing.
Readying for a new chapter Author Kristin Hannah has put her longtime home in Kauai, Hawaii, up for sale at $10.75 million. The oceanfront contemporary sits on about half an acre in the desirable North Shore area. Built in 1998, the multilevel house features two offset wings, each with 9-foot-tall pocketing glass walls oriented toward the ocean. Balconies and patios on each level make the most of the coastal setting. Inside, high ceilings and natural light create a feeling of spaciousness from room to room. The floor plan includes an ocean-view office, a great room with a fireplace, a wet bar, three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. Custom Koa wood cabinetry stands out in the kitchen. Outside, tropical landscaping and ocean views create a backdrop for a dining lanai. A swath of lawn sits between the house and miles of sandy beachfront.
Hannah has written more than a dozen novels including "Firefly Lane," "On Mystic Lake" and "The Nightingale," the latter of which was a New York Times bestseller. Her latest book, "The Great Alone," also made the New York Times list as both print and audiobook bestseller this year. She bought the place more than a decade ago for $4.45 million, records show.
Ben Welborn and Tiffany Spencer of Hawaii Life hold the listing.
Swinging for a profit PGA Tour golfer J.B. Holmes has teed up his Florida home for sale at $2.15 million. That's $100,000 more than he paid for it four years ago. Set lakeside on three-quarters of an acre, the two-story house expands to a glass atrium with a fountain-fed swimming pool with a spa, kitchen and fireplace. Inside, five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms are spread across 6,325 square feet of space. Through a double-door entry, there's a foyer lined with tile and a two-story living room under wood-coffered ceilings. An elevator runs upstairs, where pocket doors in the master suite open to a covered lanai overlooking the pool. Other second-story living spaces include a movie theater and a loft with a wet bar. The home was built in 2007. It's found in the Concession neighborhood outside Bradenton.
Holmes, 36, boasts seven wins as a professional golfer, including four on the PGA Tour. The most recent came three years ago when he won the Shell Houston Open in a playoff with Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner.
Holly Pascarella of Keller Williams Realty Select holds the listing.

Resumen: Declare me the winner RALEIGH, N.C. - The Republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a North Carolina court Thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act. A lawsuit by GOP candidate Mark Harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the Republican's campaign was invalid. "Time is of the essence," Harris' lawsuit states. Because the new elections board won't be created for weeks, "the uniform finality of a federal election is endangered by the State Board's actions and the citizens of the 9th District have no representation in Congress."

RALEIGH, N.C. - The Republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a North Carolina court Thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act.
A lawsuit by GOP candidate Mark Harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the Republican's campaign was invalid.
The elections board was dissolved Dec. 28 by state judges who in October declared its makeup unconstitutional but had allowed investigations to continue. A revamped board doesn't officially come into existence until Jan. 31.
"Time is of the essence," Harris' lawsuit states. Because the new elections board won't be created for weeks, "the uniform finality of a federal election is endangered by the State Board's actions and the citizens of the 9th District have no representation in Congress."
Sanders contrite as aides face allegations
NEW YORK - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his chief lieutenants are offering contrition as some of his 2016 campaign staffers face allegations of sexual harassment that threaten to derail a second White House bid before it begins.
Hours after a New York Times report detailed allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity on his first campaign, Sanders apologized late Wednesday "to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately."
"Of course, if I run again, we will do better next time," Sanders told CNN.
Yet there were immediate signs that the allegations, which did not directly involve Sanders, could hurt the self-described democratic socialist's 2020 ambitions in the midst of the #MeToo era. In the wake of the report, some Democratic activists and operatives complained about the aggressive culture during the first campaign when male staffers and supporters were sometimes labeled "Bernie bros."
Trial of 11 defendants begins in Saudi Arabia
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A Saudi court on Thursday launched the trial of 11 men charged with involvement in the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi three months ago, the kingdom's chief prosecutor said.
Khashoggi, a sharp critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed on Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a case that has triggered global condemnation.
The 11 defendants - all Saudi nationals - appeared at the Criminal Court in the capital Riyadh on Thursday for the first hearing in the trial, top prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb said in a statement, according to the state news agency SPA.
They included five defendants for whom prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for their direct involvement in Khashoggi's murder, the statement added, without disclosing names.
The bill of indictment against the accused was read out at the procedural session.
"During the initial hearing of the case, the defendants requested a copy of the indictment and additional time to respond. The defendants' request was approved," the statement said.
Prosecutors, meanwhile, were questioning other suspects in connection with the case.
No date has been set for the next hearing.
The chief prosecutor also said Turkey has yet to respond to a Saudi request to provide any evidence linked to the case.
After weeks of denials and under growing international pressure, Saudi Arabia backtracked on its initial claims that Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, had left the consulate alive and admitted that he was killed in a "fist fight."
Later in October, the kingdom's chief prosecutor said the murder was premeditated.
Five top officials were fired, including the then-deputy chief of the intelligence service, Ahmed al-Asiri, who was once close to the crown prince.
In November, Saudi prosecutors said that Khashoggi's body was dismembered and handed over to a local collaborator. His remains have not been located yet.
Turkey has claimed the murder was ordered by the "highest levels" of the Saudi government and called for Riyadh to hand over 18 people arrested over alleged links to the murder so they could be tried in Turkey.
Saudi Arabia has rejected their extradition and insisted on their trial at home.
Saudi officials have repeatedly denied reports that Prince Mohammed was linked to Khashoggi's murder.

JOHANNESBURG - The U.S. military says it has carried out an airstrike in southwestern Somalia that killed 10 members of the al-Shabab extremist group.
The U.S. Africa Command statement says the airstrike occurred Wednesday near Dheerow Sanle to "diminish al-Shabab's freedom of movement and to increase pressure on the terrorist network."
The statement says no civilians were injured or killed.
This is the first reported U.S. airstrike of the year in Somalia. The U.S. carried out at least 47 such strikes last year in the Horn of Africa nation.
The al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab continues to control large parts of the country's southern and central regions and carry out deadly bombings against high-profile targets in the capital, Mogadishu.
The U.S. has sharply increased the number of airstrikes since President Donald Trump took office.

It's been busy year for companies that tackle sexual harassment

Texto completo: Andrew Rawson's cell phone beeped as he worked on a video in Traliant's New Jersey office.
The message wasn't from a friend or a telemarketer.
It was an email from a company seeking assistance from Traliant, which offers training courses and interactive videos about harassment in the workplace.
"We serve companies with 20 people, and other companies with 100,000 people," said Rawson, co-founder and chief learning officer at Traliant, which this past spring moved from its Montclair headquarters into a larger space in East Hanover.
"A year after #MeToo, preventing sexual harassment in the workplace remains in the spotlight and one of the top priorities for human resources professionals and their organizations," said Carole Walters, an editor at Traliant.
Walters said the company offers training on preventing discrimination and harassment in office settings, and has been expanding it to include to hospitality, industrial, manufacturing and health care sectors.
At Traliant, the goal is to teach people about laws on sexual and other types of harassment and how to behave accordingly, Rawson said.
"Before Traliant, [employers] trained you on the laws but had no idea if that made a difference in anybody's behavior," Rawson said.
"Now we're showing people how they can disrupt a harassment situation," Rawson said. "We're showing them how they should report a sexual harassment situation, knowing it's not easy to do that."
CEO and co-founder Mike Pallatta said training is a way to "create the conversation and raise awareness" about what is and isn't acceptable behavior in the workplace.
"Employees are being more sensitive to bad behavior," said Pallatta. "Little comments that you'd think were fine five years ago may not be today. There are things you have to be careful talking about."
How is sexual harassment defined? Sexual harassment is unlawfully harassing someone based on a person's sex and can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and verbal or physical harassment that has a sexual nature, Rawson explained.
Harassment is unwelcome conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability or genetic information, which are characteristics protected under federal law. "People tend to be unclear about these definitions because legally, only members of the 'protected classes' are protected from harassment or discrimination," Rawson said in an email. "However, in practical terms, no organization wants their people to harass or discriminate against anyone for any reason."
Lauren Hersh, national director of World Without Exploitation, a movement that aims to curb sexual exploitation and human trafficking, said people today have more of an understanding about what sexual harassment is in the workplace than they did five to 10 years ago.
"There's been such a transformation in our culture," Hersh said. "I don't think we're there yet but we're on our way.
"We're talking about these issues in a way we hadn't been five years ago," she noted.
Sexual harassment in the media It was a little over a year ago that The New York Times broke a story alleging decades of sexual harassment of multiple women by media mogul Harvey Weinstein.
A litany of cases followed. Host Matt Lauer was fired from the "Today" show amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations. Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued her boss Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and won a $20 million settlement. And former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly wrote a memoir, "Settle for More," detailing her experiences involving sexual harassment at Fox News.
Rosemarie Arnold, an attorney in Fort Lee, says the #MeToo Movement and "the Hollywood exposé of people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby" pushed victims to come forward.
"When it happens in Hollywood, people actually believe it's real, which is interesting," said Arnold, who has worked on about 250 sexual harassment cases over the past decade.
Arnold said her experience has been that individuals often hesitate to come forward because they are told by a supervisor or their harasser that nobody will believe them.
Now, she said, "Women and men feel a lot more comfortable coming forward and making accusations. They feel they'll be believed and that action will be taken to help them out," Arnold said.
What else is changing? A tax law affecting settlements went into effect last year, and may be problematic for employers and employees, said Montclair-based attorney Leslie Farber.
Farber said employers can no longer deduct settlement payments in sexual harassment cases that are considered confidential. Employees must pay taxes on the full amount of the settlement, including the attorney fees, which were formerly deductible, Farber said.
Farber said New Jersey employees are pushing to get rid of forced arbitration, which limits workers' right to discovery.
"This puts the employee at a significant disadvantage because so much of the information the employee needs to prove her or his case is in the employer's hand," Farber said in an email.
There is also a bill in the state Legislature that would prohibit non-disclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases, Farber said.
For Traliant, the #MeToo movement has presented an opportunity to get a message out about prevention.
The mindset people have about sexual harassment is changing, say Traliant's co-founders. "If someone says, 'Can I meet you for a drink?' and the person says 'Sure,' we'll train on that with a video. If the person says 'no,' we'll train on that, too," said Rawson.
Pallatta said, "We'll integrate the company's policy into the video."
"It's about coming to an understanding of what really is acceptable behavior and having an appropriate amount of sensitivity," Pallatta said.
The expanding company recently hired Kristin Hassan to be its vice president of business development. Hassan was executive director of the Society for Human Resource Management in New York City.
Attorney Leslie Farber, shown working in her Montclair office, said employers can no longer deduct settlement payments in sexual harassment cases that are considered confidential.

By Lisa Friedman
Happy 2019, everyone! While many of us are back to work, parts of the federal government are still closed.
The shutdown has not affected the Energy Department, since that agency's funding has already been approved by Congress. But the Interior Department is struggling with mounting garbage and dirty bathrooms at national parks that are being kept open with minimal staffing. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been operating through Friday, has now furloughed thousands of workers.
Just before the furloughs, the E.P.A. issued a major regulatory announcement: a plan to weaken standards that were designed to keep mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants out of the atmosphere. The proposal could also hamper the government's ability to enact future pollution regulations.
And what about the effects that the Trump administration's policies are already having? I hope you made some time over the holidays to read this tremendous investigation by my colleagues Eric Lipton, Steve Eder and John Branch detailing the impacts on communities across the country as the administration eliminates dozens of Obama-era environmental rules.
Meanwhile, Representative Nancy Pelosi, expected to be sworn in as speaker of the House this week, has appointed Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, to lead a new select committee on climate change. Ms. Castor said in a statement that Congress must reduce carbon pollution "by unleashing American ingenuity and creating clean energy jobs to power our future."
The committee has its critics, including incoming Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has championed the idea of a "Green New Deal" that would, among other things, transition the country to 100 percent renewable energy and provide a universal jobs guarantee. In a tweet this week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez commended the creation of the select committee but she said the panel would be weakened without subpoena power or a mandate to develop Green New Deal legislation. "There is still time to strengthen it," she wrote.
Notably, one solution that doesn't seem to be up for serious consideration from the panel is a carbon tax. That could be because, as Justin Gillis asserts in this thought-provoking opinion column, it's too politically toxic at the moment. On the other hand, the idea is getting new traction in some quarters, including from Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who co-sponsored legislation at the end of 2018 with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to tax emissions and return the proceeds to American households as a dividend.
Expect this issue to heat up in the next Congress.

A new year is a time to look back and to look forward. So, in that spirit of reflection, we reviewed our "One Thing You Can Do" series, looking for some New Year's resolutions. These individual actions are not a substitute for broader systemic change, but they can still help you lower your personal contribution to global warming.
New Year's resolutions often mean doing more, like working out more or saving more for retirement. But one common thread we found was that if you want to lower your climate footprint, you can find some success in simply consuming less. And it will save you money, too.
Hang onto your phone
Take, for example, your cellphone. Most of us hold onto them for only two years, but as we noted in November, producing a common smartphone released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, about as much running a modern refrigerator for a year. That is one of the biggest reasons that the global carbon footprint of smartphones is projected to increase by 730 percent this decade.
While some companies are making strides in reducing the environmental impact associated with producing our favorite mobile devices, hanging onto your phone for longer than two years is one way to make a difference.
Buy less clothing
Another thing that's helpful to hold onto? Your old clothes. The amount of textile waste in the United States increased by more than 800 percent from 1960 to 2015, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. (The population grew by about 78 percent during that period.)
The process of creating all of that fabric has a significant environmental impact, including on the climate. One thing you can do is to buy less clothing; spend the new year shopping in your closet instead.
Reduce food waste
Also spend more time searching through your cupboard this year. January is a great time to use up the contents of your fridge and cabinets before food spoils and you have to throw it out.
Globally, we throw out about a third of the food we buy, and if food waste were its own country it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the United States, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
Reducing food waste is a great way to cut your greenhouse gas emissions, and it can help reduce your grocery bill at the same time.
But while you're thinking about the best ways to cook up holiday leftovers, don't do it in front of the refrigerator. Make sure to shut the fridge door when you're not pulling things out -- keeping the door shut is the most effective thing you can do to lower your fridge's energy consumption.

Texto completo: The Weather Channel app deceptively collected, shared and profited from the location information of millions of American consumers, the city attorney of Los Angeles said in a lawsuit filed on Thursday.
One of the most popular online weather services in the United States, the Weather Channel app has been downloaded more than 100 million times and has 45 million active users monthly.
The government said the Weather Company, the business behind the app, unfairly manipulated users into turning on location tracking by implying that the information would be used only to localize weather reports. Yet the company, which is owned by IBM, also used the data for unrelated commercial purposes, like targeted marketing and analysis for hedge funds, according to the lawsuit.
The city's lawsuit cited an article last month in The New York Times that detailed a sprawling industry of companies that profit from continuously snooping on users' precise whereabouts. The companies collect location data from smartphone apps to cater to advertisers, stores and investors seeking insights into consumer behavior.
The Times found that at least 75 companies collected precise location data -- on at least one occasion logging a person's whereabouts more than 14,000 times in just one day. Yet many of the pop-up notices that apps showed to prompt consumers to enable location services only partly disclosed how their data would be shared and used. The Los Angeles lawsuit says such incomplete messages are "fraudulent and deceptive" and violate California's Unfair Competition Law.
"If the price of getting a weather report is going to be the sacrifice of your most personal information about where you spend your time day and night," said Michael N. Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney, "you sure as heck ought to be told clearly in advance."
An IBM spokesman, Saswato Das, said, "The Weather Company has always been transparent with use of location data; the disclosures are fully appropriate, and we will defend them vigorously."
The lawsuit was filed amid mounting public concern and government scrutiny over how tech companies collect, use and share consumers' personal details. After a spate of scandals -- including Facebook's sharing of user data with third parties -- federal lawmakers are preparing to introduce consumer privacy legislation this year.
Regulators consider precise location data to be particularly sensitive because it can reveal intimate details about people's lives, including visits to doctors' offices, places of worship and participation in political protests.
In the complaint, the city attorney excoriated the Weather Company, saying it unfairly took advantage of its app's popularity and the fact that consumers were likely to give their location data to get local weather alerts. The city said that the company failed to sufficiently disclose its data practices when it got users' permission to track their location and that it obscured other tracking details in its privacy policy.
"These issues certainly aren't limited to our state," Mr. Feuer said. "Ideally this litigation will be the catalyst for other action -- either litigation or legislative activity -- to protect consumers' ability to assure their private information remains just that, unless they speak clearly in advance."
The suit seeks civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation of the Unfair Competition Law. In such cases, a judge determines the number of violations and amount of the penalties. Given the number of California residents who may use the Weather Channel app, the penalties could add up to millions of dollars if the city wins the case.
The Los Angeles city attorney's office frequently takes on consumer-protection cases. In 2015, it sued Wells Fargo under the same law for opening unauthorized accounts, obtaining a $50 million settlement in 2016.

Texto completo: Bob Einstein, a two-time Emmy-award winning actor known for his recurring role in “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and Super Dave character, has died after battling cancer, his representative confirmed to the Daily News. He was 76.
The actor and comedian famously played Marty Funkhouser, Larry David’s pal, on the HBO show. The two were known for squabbling over numerous topics, including whether or not Funkhouser was an orphan after his mother dies and he is left parentless.
“It was an amazing, unforgettable experience knowing and working with him. There was no one like him, as he told us again and again,” David said Wednesday. “We’re all in a state of shock.”
Comedian Richard Lewis, who also had a recurring role on “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” posted a tribute to his former costar.
“I’m in shock. I knew him forever. (Heart emoji) to his loved ones. His long career is hard to match,” Lewis wrote. “His role on #curbyourenthusiasm was excruciatingly brilliant! Our cast and crew will be devastated. He was so loved. He told me how much he loved LD and Curb. RIP buddy.”
Einstein was scheduled to be part of the 10th season of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” but his health barred him from filming, HBO said.
Einstein was also known for creating the stuntman character Super Dave Osborne, for which he won a CableACE Award. He portrayed Super Dave in multiple television appearances, and was the star of 2000 film “The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave.”
As Super Dave, Einstein was a witless, deadpan parody of bravado-fueled stuntmen like Evel Knievel. Dressed in a mostly white jumpsuit and crash helmet, Super Dave attempted perilous stunts that invariably flopped and appeared to have caused him great bodily harm.
“I deal out of a reality that isn’t real,” Einstein said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what that means. I don’t really know what I do.”
He appeared on Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” in 2017. It was his second time on the show, making him the first guest to appear twice.
He won an Emmy for writing on the 1960s series “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” on which he also played opposite brothers Tom and Dick Smothers, and a second Emmy in 1976 for Dick Van Dyke’s “Van Dyke and Company” variety series.
Einstein’s brother, Albert Brooks, is an acclaimed actor, writer and director, known for films such as “Modern Romance” and “Lost in America” — both of which he also wrote and directed — and acting-only roles in “Broadcast News” and “Drive.”
Brooks, 71, remembered him as “a great brother, father and husband,” in a tweet Wednesday. “A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.”
He is survived by his wife, Roberta; his daughter, Erin Einstein Dale; two grandchildren; and his brothers, Albert and Cliff.
Harry Einstein, his father, was also a comedian. He died in 1958 at the Roast of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz at New York City’s Friars Club. Einstein was making his way back to his seat when he suddenly collapsed and died.

Bug photos take Ky. man around the globe

Texto completo: Tom Myers makes a living as president of a Lexington pest control company, but he also is known as a world-traveling photographer of insects, spiders, scorpions and ticks.
Among his subjects: termites that shoot glue out of their heads, an African spider that throws a web over its prey, an ambush bug that covers itself in debris to disguise itself.
His pursuit of exotic bugs has taken him to all seven continents (yes, there are tiny insects that live in icebound Antarctica). His photos have been exhibited in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and published in USA TODAY, National Geographic's Traveler magazine and "Truman's Scientific Guide to Pest Management Operations," the "bible" of the industry.
The Fall 2018 issue of American Entomologist had a cover photo of a treehopper that Myers photographed in a Peruvian rainforest. An entomologist is a scientist who studies insects. Myers often speaks at conferences, training courses and in presentations to schools and civic groups.
Myers, 67, said he wants his photos to convey the incredible array of colors, shapes and behavior in tiny creatures.
"It's something that people don't notice on a regular basis," he said. "When people see the insect diversity, they're in awe because they've never seen anything like that close up."
Myers shoots with a Canon camera, and uses a macro lens to take magnified portraits of his miniscule subjects. But perhaps the most important tool is patience.
"You can't train insects or other wildlife," Myers said. "They're moving constantly so it's always a challenge. It can be frustrating.
"As with most animals, you have a comfort range, so you have to figure out what the comfort range is. A lot of times when you're photographing an insect, you may start out photographing from farther away, and then you move a little bit closer and a little bit closer. When he starts reacting, you may have to back off a little bit."
The most extreme environment in which Myers has taken pictures was in Alaska where it was 50 degrees below zero when he shot the Northern Lights.
Dan Moreland, publisher of PCT Magazine, a trade publication for the pest-control technologies industry, said photos by Myers have been published repeatedly in that journal.
"What makes him so good is he's able to shoot insects in the wild, in their natural habitat," Moreland said. "There are a lot of photographers who will shoot dead specimens of insects because you can shoot them easily. But what makes Tom so incredible is he shoots insects in the wild. That's hard to do and it's hard to do well."
The Myers home is decorated with his photos of larger wildlife, such as penguins, polar bears, a tree frog and a mountain gorilla.
A native of Salem in southern Indiana, Myers grew up on a farm that raised cows, sheep and ponies. He got interested in bugs as a boy during his time in 4-H. His mother was familiar with insects from her time at a research orchard.
"It helps a lot when your mother is tolerant of insects," he said. "If I collected stuff, I would put it in the refrigerator to keep it inactive, to slow it down, until I could study it later. She didn't seem to care about it, which was good."
After graduating from Purdue University, he did graduate studies at Iowa State University. There he did research on agricultural insects.
He came to the University of Kentucky in the 1970s to conduct research on alfalfa weevils and potato leafhoppers, and to train people in the pest control field. He started All-Rite Pest Control Inc. in 1977.
He said the public needed a company with a certified entomologist who could give better identification of bugs and better advice about pest control.
"If you don't understand the pest, your chance of control is probably very slim," he said. "If you don't understand where the bugs will hide, the environments they like and how they multiply, then your control program is probably not going to work."
Although he's made a living killing bugs, Myers said people should know the importance of insects. As the New York Times Magazine put it in November: "Trillions of bugs flitting from flower to flower pollinate some three-quarters of our food crops, a service worth as much as $500 billion every year."
"Without insects the entire ecosystem would collapse," Myers said. "Ninety-eight or 99 percent of insects are of no harm to humans. We have a lot of flies that spread diseases. But we have insects that destroy dead animals. Buzzards can't eat it all. In a lot of these places, without dung beetles, you'd be up to your waist in droppings."
Myers plans to travel in 2019 to take more photographs but he acknowledges that crouching down to insect-level is getting more difficult.
"My knees are not as good as they used to be."

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany.
"I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but Cuomo demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Longtime allies Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Gillibrand weighing run Another New Yorker, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."
The governor said Biden is best suited to do that.
"You don't hire an airline pilot who has never flown a plane," Cuomo said. "Where is the credibility in your argument? Joe Biden can say 'I was there. I was not the president, but I was the second seat.'"

Texto completo: Happy New Year to all. Apparently this year is going to go by absurd name “2019,” which just doesn’t sound like a year, to me, but I will have to get used to it.
One prominent Republican decided to make New Year’s Day his personal Independence Day as well. Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah published an op-ed in the Washington Post and made clear that he will not be silent about his disagreements with President Donald Trump. Here’s a paragraph from the op-ed:
To reassume our leadership in world politics, we must repair failings in our politics at home. That project begins, of course, with the highest office once again acting to inspire and unite us. It includes political parties promoting policies that strengthen us rather than promote tribalism by exploiting fear and resentment. Our leaders must defend our vital institutions despite their inevitable failings: a free press, the rule of law, strong churches, and responsible corporations and unions.
It’s a dignified statement and contains no personal attacks, but clearly indicates that, unlike many Republicans in both houses of Congress, Romney plans to express his differences with the incumbent president of his own party. During most of the past three years (including the election year of 2016), few Republican members of Congress or candidates have taken on Trump, except for those who had decided to retire from politics or were deathly ill.
Romney, the last previous Republican presidential nominee before Trump, will turn 72 in March and on Thursday will begin a six-year Senate term, which may give him freedom to express himself that others, worried about a longer political future, feel they cannot. I don’t claim to know, and I note that Romney previously showed a willingness to audition for an appointment to the Trump Cabinet.
If Romney does speak and act independently, it might make a difference; I don’t claim to know. But his op-ed was a welcome personal declaration of independence. Perhaps it will start a trend.
In the op-ed, Romney didn’t dwell on Trump’s personal conduct. He seems mostly focused on foreign policy, and is troubled with the way Trump has disrespected some of our allies and multilateral alliances. For example, he wrote:
America is strongest when our arms are linked with other nations. We want a unified and strong Europe, not a disintegrating union. We want stable relationships with the nations of Asia that strengthen our mutual security and prosperity.
The closest he came to mentioning Trump’s personal conduct was oblique, writing in this paragraph:
I will act as I would with any president, in or out of my party: I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not. I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.
It’s not that oblique, but no names or specific racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive tweets are mentioned.
It will be interesting to see how Trump and Romney’s soon-to-be Senate Republican colleagues respond.
The full Romney op-ed is here.
*** Late morning addendum:
When I wrote the piece above immediately after seeing Romney’s op-ed, it didn’t occur to me that he might be positioning himself to challenge Trump for the 2020 presidential nomination. The New York Times wondered if that was part of the plan, but added:
At the outset of the year before his re-election, however, Mr. Trump does not appear vulnerable to an intraparty threat. He remains broadly popular among Republicans and even more so among the party’s most engaged voters, those most likely to vote in a primary.
But the president is also facing sprawling investigations that touch on nearly every aspect of his life and, with Democrats in charge of the House, is about to face a level of congressional scrutiny and oversight he averted in his first two years in office.
*** Even later morning addendum:
President Trump replied by tweet. Nothing surprising in the choice of medium.
But somewhat surprising is the tone. Instead of condemning, attacking or insulting Romney, the presidential tweet bordered on conciliatory (unless you judge him by normal human standards, in which bringing up Romney’s 2012 defeat might be considered a tad rude). But still, compared to his usual tone, it’s a note this POTUS’ trumpet seldom plays.
Tweeted he:
Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!
Hardly eloquent. And calling it “conciliatory” as I just did is a stretch. But instead of condemning Romney to eternal damnation, he suggests a search for common ground.

Texto completo: The partial government shutdown entered its 12th day on Wednesday, as congressional leaders planned to meet with President Donald Trump.
'Hoping for the best, planning for the worst'
By Ernest Johnson
Everyone affected by the shutdown is a real person, including myself. I have bills, just like everyone. And while I'm just a single guy, others are single parents, have families, are caring for elderly parents, among others. The shutdown has created 800,000 permutations of this example. Just like many Americans, I'm struggling to make ends meet.
Not knowing how long the shutdown would last — and anticipating it might last more than two weeks, and that if we get back pay, it might not be for a couple weeks, as well — I chatted with Ally Auto Finance and asked whether my account was in good enough standing to request a deferment due to the furlough and not having income. Ally allowed it, but a "deferment" is a "pay the interest in January" and February is the difference of a full payment, so I'm still paying $160 this month, but next month it'll be about $360.
Talker: Is Warren the candidate Democrats have been waiting for? Some doubt it
Those of us affected by the shutdown are your friends and neighbors, our children go to the same schools, we attend the same religious centers, and we are all focused on providing for our families and the communities in which we live. We do not go to work waving flags with "Go Team Red" or "Go Team Blue. " My co-workers and team members have common goals of providing the most efficient, quality service to the public who depend on our services.
I'm still waiting on unemployment insurance to be approved, then I can know how much I'll need to borrow from friends come Feb. 1 for rent and bills due early that month.
When you see our #ShutdownStories, please understand that we are regular people. We are nervous, stressed, afraid, worried and concerned about all this, and we are simply expressing our feelings. Personally, I would be fine working with no pay (knowing I will get back pay), just so I can keep my services, responsibilities and commitments to the public. I do not know how all of this will end, all I know is that I will just put one foot in front of the other and make it through another day. Hoping for the best, planning for the worst.
Ernest Johnson is a federal employee in Wyoming. You can follow him on Twitter: @SciFiCowboy_v2.
What others are saying
The New York Times, editorial: "For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room. "
Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: "What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority. "
The Washington Post, editorial: "In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation’s immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts. "
What our readers are saying
Why is border security any more critical now than it was two years ago when Donald Trump became president? Has Trump made it worse over the past two years? Republicans had two years to get Trump his wall and they didn't.
— John Bertelson
Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have no incentive to end the shutdown. As long as they think the shutdown will hurt Trump politically, they could not care less how much the shutdown hurts the country and its people.
— Robert Johnson
In two years, Trump couldn't get a dime out of a Republican majority Congress for his silly wall. So now he tells his true supporters it can magically happen by constitutionally mugging the nation?
— Dannie Leroy Porath

U.S. MILITARY TWEETS JOKE ABOUT DROPPING BOMBS

Texto completo: The U.S. military command responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons tweeted a New Year's Eve message Monday afternoon: It is always ready to "drop something much, much bigger" than Manhattan's iconic Time Square ball.
The post and accompanying video went live as the country readied to ring in the new year by watching the famous New York City ball descend at midnight.
The U.S. Strategic Command has since deleted and apologized for the tweet.
"We admittedly erred in connecting it to New Year's Eve festivities, and we apologize," said Meghan M. Liemburg-Archer, a U.S. Strategic Command spokeswoman. "We remain dedicated to the security of America and our allies."
The New Year's Eve post drew confusion and criticism on the social media platform.
Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, reposted the now-deleted tweet and asked, "What kind of maniacs are running this country?"
Resignation at Pentagon
WASHINGTON -The Defense Department's top spokeswoman, who had been under investigation since May over whether she mistreated employees, abruptly resigned Monday night within hours of the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
Dana W. White said on Twitter: "I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by this administration to serve alongside Secretary Mattis, our service members and all the civilians who support them. It has been my honor and privilege. Stay safe and God bless."
Charles E. Summers Jr., replaced Ms. White, becoming "acting" assistant to the defense secretary, according to the Pentagon.
It is not clear whether Ms. White's departure was related to reports of the probe by the inspector general to determine whether she mistreated staff members or retaliated against them after they raised concerns.
Six current and former Pentagon officials had said at least two complaints were filed against Ms. White. The probe focused in part on how staff members carried out personal tasks for her, such as retrieving her dry cleaning, getting her lunch and driving her to work during a snowstorm.
At least five staff members had been abruptly transferred or removed from their jobs since Ms. White, a Trump administration political appointee, took over in April 2017.
Marine fatally shot
WASHINGTON - A U.S. Marine was shot and killed Tuesday morning inside the Marine Barracks on Capitol Hill in Southeast Washington, prompting a District of Columbia police investigation.
Two officials with knowledge of the investigation said it appears the Marine was struck by an accidental discharge from another Marine's weapon.Authorities cautioned the investigation is in its beginning stages.
No arrests have been made and police classified the case as a "death investigation," an indication that, at least for now, investigators do not believe a crime was committed. The shooting occurred about 5 a.m. A Marine Corps spokeswoman, Capt. Colleen McFadden, said she could only confirm that the victim did not suffer "a self-inflicted injury." The name of the victim, described as in his early 20s, was not made public Tuesday.
The post canceled its traditional New Year's Day serenade, a formal affair in which an audience is invited as the Marine Corps Band plays for the commandant at his home.
The Marine Barracks Washington, founded in 1801 by President Thomas Jefferson, is the oldest active Marine Corps post. Its personnel perform both ceremonial and security missions in the District and is home to the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps and the Marine Band, as well as the site of the Home of the Commandants.
Public pre-K in New York
NEW YORK - A well-placed, orderly sandbox. Teachers who laugh often. Plenty of miniature tables and chairs. Those are markers of an excellent pre-K classroom. And New York City, home to the largest citywide prekindergarten initiative in the country, has these features - and many more - in the vast majority of its programs, according to new data shared with The New York Times.
In 2018, about 94 percent of the city's pre-K programs met or exceeded a threshold that predicts positive student outcomes after pre-K, according to a national evaluation system, the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, developed by a coalition of experts.
This means that as Mayor Bill de Blasio's signature initiative - public pre-K for all 4-year-olds in New York City - gets bigger, it is also getting better.
In 2013, there were only 19,000 New York City children enrolled in pre-K; Mr. de Blasio's initiative launched in 2014 and now enrolls about 70,000 pre-K students.

Lebanon’s Main Economic Challenge

Información de publicación: Valley News ; White River Junction, Vt. [White River Junction, Vt]. 02 Jan 2019: 7.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/lebanon-s-main-economic-challenge/docview/2162387670/se-2?accountid=14708

Texto completo: Lebanon’s Main Economic Challenge
A recent Forum letter questioned whether Lebanon is abiding by the “guiding principles” adopted by the City Council in 2010 (“ ‘Guiding Principles’ Offer Little Guidance,” Dec. 23).
The first of nine such principles is that “all actions and policies of the government of the City of Lebanon shall, first and foremost, benefit the current residents of the City of Lebanon.” Legitimate concerns by many residents arise from news coverage of some city officials proposing to develop a “marketing plan” to attract new high-tech businesses, particularly in the biomedical field, to Lebanon. Just to be clear, the City Council has yet to take up and discuss this matter, so there is no City Council consensus on this.
I have been serving as a council representative on the Economic Vitality Exchange Committee for the past several years. I have repeatedly stated that I think our main challenge with regard to economic vitality is to support the prosperity of the businesses that are already here and employing Lebanon residents.
Second to that is enabling creative local entrepreneurship. I’ve questioned whether we need any marketing to attract new businesses to the city. Some employers might be aided by improving awareness of the many career opportunities that exist for spouses of prospective highly skilled employees, but that is quite different from trying to attract new businesses from outside of the area.
A central aspect of “economic development” traditionally has been improving the standard of living or quality of life of a community. I believe there are limits to physical growth, but not our growth spiritually and as a caring and strong community.
Our city’s guiding principles, principles for sustainability and Master Plan all help inform the council’s discussion and community engagement in developing a better understanding of the role of any economic development strategies in potentially benefiting or harming the community of Lebanon.
Clifton BelowLebanonAn Enduring and Worthy Message

Claremont resident Sam Killay has asked for the removal of the Christmas crèche from Broad Street Park because its presence reinforces the belief that Christianity is the favored religion of the United States. Ward 3 Councilor Jonathan Stone confirms this interpretation when he states that complaints about a crèche are a result of “mental health issues,” a statement that both Jesus and God would consider unworthy of a true Christian.
It is difficult to reconcile Stone’s statement with what I assume to be his respect for the U.S. Constitution — which explicitly states that our country has no favored religion. As some commentators have noted, the constitutional issue could be resolved by simply displaying a variety of other religious and secular seasonal decorations scattered around the park.
However, the question remains why any religious symbols should be displayed on public land. How about a tall, dignified and tastefully lit Christmas tree crowned with a dove. This would celebrate both the passing of the longest night of the year and the most enduring and worthy message of all religious and non-religious people alike: “Peace on Earth, Good Will to All.”
Cappy NunlistLebanonSpare Us Such Photos, Please
I continue to be discouraged by the callous display of dead animals as front-page news. I do not wish to be in a debate about hunting, but a personal trophy of a dead deer is not news to all of your readers, nor is a poor, sick bobcat held in a snare. The article regarding the fact that the animal had rabies served as an alert to the public and was quite enough. The happy young women winning a sports event would have been a much better start to the day.
Class and good taste should be the goals of a local newspaper. I do not remember ever seeing such pictures on the front page of The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. Maybe I missed them, but I do not think so.
Let us try to set an example of sensitivity in a time when it appears to be lacking.
Linda J. WilsonSpringfield, Vt.Republicans Must Remove Trump
The president elected in 2020 could be a competent Republican, such as Mitt Romney, John Kasich or Paul Ryan, but not if Donald Trump is still president and de facto party head. His leadership is going from bad to worse as accomplished subordinates give up trying to administer our government rationally.
His egomaniacal blunders include tariffs, immigration, taxes and relations with China, Russia and North Korea. He’s dangerous. Republicans must prove themselves now by initiating impeachment proceedings so that Trump is removed from office and the party before 2020.

When doctors turn to verse and rhyme

Texto completo: Dr. Rafael Campo describes poetry as a form of primary care that can help heal both patient and physician. Campo, who practices and teaches at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, was recently appointed editor of the Poetry and Medicine section of the medical journal JAMA. He is the latest in a line connecting poetry to medicine. Here is a look at some other notable poets who trained as doctors.
John Keats: The English Romantic poet was apprenticed to his family's London doctor at age 14 then trained for six months at Guy's Hospital, where he was quickly promoted to “dresser," assisting surgeons during operations. He also was a qualified apothecary, the forerunner of the pharmacist. In his poetry, he suggests that scientific knowledge can so demystify the natural world that it lessens its allure. He writes in the poem “Lamia" (1820):
Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.
Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr : The Cambridge native practiced medicine and later became dean of Harvard Medical School. In 1843, Holmes famously publicized the connection between infection and cleanliness, urging fellow surgeons to wash thoroughly, wear clean clothes, and abstain from deliveries for 48 hours after coming into contact with a case of puerperal, or postpartum, infection. His poem “Old Ironsides" (1830) is credited with helping to save the Navy frigate USS Constitution from being scapped.
O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave.

William Carlos Williams : A New Jersey native and lifelong resident, Williams obtained a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania and did advanced study in pediatricts. He maintained a practice out of his home — and delivered an estimated 3,000 babies — even as he became a strong voice in the modernist movement of literature. In Williams's 1917 poem “January Morning," a physician makes an appearance.
The young doctor is dancing with happiness
in the sparkling wind, alone
at the prow of the ferry! He notices
the curdy barnacles and broken ice crusts
left at the slip's base by the low tide
and thinks of summer and green

Texto completo: A bit of common sense and common decency intruded last week into the crazy world of Donald Trump.
In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the "charity" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.
In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.
Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador.
The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.
Then, the week before last, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the FBI acted improperly in interviewing him - points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.
Sullivan was having none of it.
"I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty," the judge said, "and I do not intend to start today."
Chastened, Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.
The judge was not upset only about Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt "disgust" at Flynn's offenses, that a retired threestar general would lie to the FBI "while on the physical premises of the White House," and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged).
It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.
Realizing that Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.
"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn," Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.
"Thanks for nothing, Mr. President," Flynn might have thought as he left court.
Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.
Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of "a shocking pattern of illegality" that "amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests."
Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.
In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.
All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer, Michael Cohen, to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him.
It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.
It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.
That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.
Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, "No one's above the law."

Toward a Happier Office With Data-Driven Nudges

Texto completo: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Technology companies like to promote artificial intelligence's potential for solving some of the world's toughest problems, like reducing automobile deaths and helping doctors diagnose diseases. A company started by three former Google employees is pitching A.I. as the answer to a more common problem: being happier at work.
The start-up, Humu, is based in Google's hometown, and it builds on some of the so-called people-analytics programs pioneered by the internet giant, which has studied things like the traits that define great managers and how to foster better teamwork.
Humu wants to bring similar data-driven insights to other companies. It digs through employee surveys using artificial intelligence to identify one or two behavioral changes that are likely to make the biggest impact on elevating a work force's happiness. Then it uses emails and text messages to "nudge" individual employees into small actions that advance the larger goal.
At a company where workers feel that the way decisions are made is opaque, Humu might nudge a manager before a meeting to ask the members of her team for input and to be prepared to change her mind. Humu might ask a different employee to come up with questions involving her team that she would like to have answered.
At the heart of Humu's efforts is the company's "nudge engine" (yes, it's trademarked). It is based on the economist Richard Thaler's Nobel Prize-winning research into how people often make decisions because of what is easier rather than what is in their best interest, and how a well-timed nudge can prompt them to make better choices.
Google has used this approach to coax employees into the corporate equivalent of eating their vegetables, prodding them to save more for retirement, waste less food at the cafeteria and opt for healthier snacks.
Using machine learning, Humu will tailor the timing, content and techniques of the messages it delivers based on how employees respond.
"Often we want to be better people," said Laszlo Bock, Humu's chief executive and Google's former leader of what the company calls people operations, or human resources. "We want to be the person we hope we can be. But we need to be reminded. A nudge can have a powerful impact if correctly deployed on how people behave and on human performance."
In Mr. Bock's decade-plus tenure at Google, the company's work force grew more than eightfold. Google struggled at times with how to manage its rapid expansion, and some employees accused the company of creating a workplace that was hostile to women.
In November, 20,000 employees -- prompted by an article in The New York Times that detailed how Google had paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of misconduct -- walked off the job to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment.
The episode underscored Google's unique and seemingly incongruous internal culture. Employees feel empowered to agitate for change, and the company takes innovative approaches to managing its work force. But deep-rooted problems fester as they would anywhere else.
While Mr. Bock was at Google, he led many of its human-resources analytics efforts and became well known in the field, writing a 2015 book that laid out the company's data-driven approach to personnel management.
He started Humu in 2017 shortly after leaving Google with two former colleagues: Jessie Wisdom, who has a doctorate in behavioral decision research and worked with Mr. Bock in people analytics, and Wayne Crosby, a former director of engineering at Google. Humu has raised $40 million and has 15 customers, companies that range in size from 150 to 65,000 employees.
One major challenge for the company is handling data and artificial intelligence in the sensitive area of human resources. Humu said its software was built with employee privacy in mind, allowing workers to delete personal data, including anonymous comments made in company surveys. Humu said it complied with Europe's stringent data privacy rules.
But will workers consider the nudges useful or manipulative?
Todd Haugh, an assistant professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, said nudges could push workers into behaving in ways that benefited their employers' interests over their own.
"The companies are the only ones who know what the purpose of the nudge is," Professor Haugh said. "The individual who is designing the nudge is the one whose interests are going to be put in the forefront."
Dr. Wisdom, who ran much of Google's nudge research, said it was hard to argue with most of the messages the company delivered because they encouraged behavior most people would welcome.
"Anybody can do whatever they want," she said. "It's just about designing the context in which people are making the decision in ways that is going to help the most people. We're never trying to get people to do things that they don't actually want to do."
Sanjiv Razdan, the chief operating officer at Sweetgreen, a salad chain and one of Humu's customers, said that if nudges did not have a track record at Google, he would probably consider the concept a bunch of "hocus-pocus happiness nonsense."
But after receiving nudges for a few months himself in emails from Mr. Crosby, whose email address is used to send the messages, Mr. Razdan said the bite-size reminders made it easy to take action right away. In one instance, he said, he was prompted to ask members of his team for their opinions on decisions he was facing.
"The team doesn't know I was nudged," he said. "But I'm not ashamed to tell everyone that I heard from Wayne today."
Jonathan Neman, Sweetgreen's chief executive, said Humu had pinpointed the issue Sweetgreen cares about most: employee retention.
Like most restaurant chains, Sweetgreen, which has 90 stores in the United States, depends on hourly employees. Retaining workers and keeping them happy is critical. Recruiting and training employees is costly, and experienced workers are more productive. Happier employees tend to treat customers better. And customers like seeing familiar faces.
In August, when Humu analyzed a survey of sentiment among 1,800 store employees that Sweetgreen had conducted the previous month, it found that 43 percent of the respondents had occasionally considered applying for jobs outside Sweetgreen.
If Sweetgreen wanted to improve its retention rate, Humu's algorithms determined, there was one statement from the survey that the chain needed more employees to agree with: "I believe there are good development opportunities for me at Sweetgreen."
Of the survey's respondents, 81 percent had reacted positively to the statement. That was a strong score for the fast-food industry, but it was still below the overall 88 percent happiness index Humu had given Sweetgreen overall. The suggestion was that although the company's employees were generally happy, some felt they lacked opportunities to advance their careers.
Humu recommended that store managers -- known as head coaches at Sweetgreen -- hold one-on-one meetings with staff members to discuss development goals.
About a month later, in early September, Elena Jimenez, the head coach at Sweetgreen's Mountain View store, got a nudge. So far, Sweetgreen is nudging only managers.
"Consider what skills each team member needs to be successful, both in their current role and longer term in their career," the email read. "Take notes. Preparing this list of skills will help you spot opportunities for your team as they arise -- so it's worth putting the work in now!"
Ms. Jimenez discussed career development at her next "sweet talk," a short meeting before her store opened one day. Then she spoke to her employees individually and learned that many of them wanted to learn different skills, whether handling online orders or chopping and dicing the vegetables that go into Sweetgreen salads.
"It was a good reminder to keep everyone happy and motivated," she said. "I hope it helps me retain my staff. It's not easy around here."
